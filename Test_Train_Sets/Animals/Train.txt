Honestly at this point I'm not sure if goats actually scream like humans, but I'm too afraid to ask
It's like the original Pinocchio when the boys turned to donkeys
never do scream like humans cunts
I like two

i swear that second scream is in goat simulator
So that's why they never used actual screaming lambs in "silence of the lambs"
well this was my life 4 years ago
My mom came to my room because she though I was watching porn ...
That second one gets me everytime xD

The horrors they must've seen. If something as primitive as a goat can understand fear on a human level then they must've seen something. This is PTSD.

I remember when I was about 15,  I was staying at dad's place in a condo community and while trying to fall asleep, I heard an old woman yelling "Heelllp, Heellllp" and after 5th help I called out to my dad I think someone was hurt, his wife coldly shouted in a condescending tone "It's just a cat in heat".  Some animals definitely can sound human. That goat in the end of the video was tricking the dog even as it started dropping it's ears like it was being yelled at.
Lelelelelelelel
That one goat sounded like a human doing a goat impression lol
YEAAAH

sheep hits puberty and what do they have on their neck uh necktackles
It's like they are having a goat version of BSE or something.
Bruh
To me it sounds like the scream one would expect of a sentient lifeform very similar to ourselves that clips in and out of the verge of conscious self awareness of the fact that it is a goat trapped in a goat body
those forget their sounds
2:56 gets me all the time XD
the ending tho
1:25 Stone Cold Steve Goaten

2:01 is fake too...
1:15 again you can hear the same scream from 0:24...totally dubbed over
the one at 0:24 u can tell its fake..they cut out the original audio and bring in the fake audio..you can tell by there being no background noise all of a sudden
the last one is funny

Not trying to start a fight, but the second one is a sheep. Every goat screaming video has it, but it ain't a goat! It's a sheep :( Baa

It's should be try not to laugh
Gives new meaning to Silence of the Lambs....
These aren't goats there are people that look and sound like goats by magic
Animals are awakening faster than humanoids.

Humanoids don't understand at this moment. That good souls are teaching them the language of Angels.

Laugh of an animal and you are laughing of god, hence giving him good reason for teaching you not to laugh of innocent.

I will die on the cross if I have to. I won't let these animals suffer from your or their ignorance.

If you want to live in heaven on earth, better treat it right and respect the givers. The Takers will be forgiven, cause they were the strong and brave ones - not giving in to these pitiful Laws and Regulations of Society.

Society is only as strong as the weakest lead.

Satanists will soon break free of their illusion of Money (mon-eyed vision) And think Twice before acting.

Demons will no longer possess, but Support.

Angels will become stronger, faster, better and Bigger than they ever have been.

Keep close to the Sun, the holy ghost, the bringer of light and life and compassion.
0:24 - A great ringtone
It is done! Pan has imparted his infinite wisdom upon us!
be be ebe ebe...
Lol I still laugh at the dog's ears when the goat makes that noise. Dog's like, "What was that?"
the last one is real?????
The last one said "YEAHHHHHHHHH" 
lol
the one at 24 seconds is in goat parodie
Obvious they share human DNA.
the second one is the most famous
#9 is fake, right? I noticed because the background noise went mute and then went back on the moment the screaming stopped. Where did that sound originally come from? It's also on #5.
I was supposed to search heavy metal screaming but then I just had to go here XD
I'm fuckin dying
They say goats are at the low levels of astral plane... Ppl like hitler go there

My life is complete....
Someone put these goats out of their misery
I fricken lost it at 0:21 XD
"Goat scream" at 0:23 and 1:15 is fake. I have this scream sound effect in a licensed media collection.
Wtf 1:23 ?!? Lol!!!!!
0:23 Wahoooo!!!
and we thought goats went buuuuhrrrr
1:41 best pet 😂😂😂
Turns out, Goats, like humans, have a range of natural voices, which seems to depend on which part of the world they live in. Goats have accents!
Anyone came from K-391 or is it just me :)
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
The first one sounds like Pee-Wee Herman.
Boooooob?
The second one is probably fake, as the other audio cuts off during it
1:17-1:22...My ex-wife spoke goat, so I got the gist of what it was trying to express. It said, "What!!, you forgot to go by the store?!! (AHHHHHHHH)...you fuckin' loser shithead!! (AHHHHHHHHH)."
what the fuck am i doing with my life
Dick Cheney said 73% of goats were just re-incarnated humans... I think he was right.
That second one reminds me of Homer.
The fuck kinda humans do you know that yell like this?
1:41 sounds exactly like a Smoker from Left 4 Dead just before it attacks lol
LOL, 1:23 is the best one. The goat seems so offended! LOL
i LOVE the last one  :D
Funny stuff ☺😊😃😄😁😂😆
JAJAJAJA 0:25 muy comico

1:37 are undercover Raving Rabbids!!!
mmmmbheheheheheeeee :3 mmmm mmmm c': mmmmbheheheheheheeeee :p :o bheeeeee c:
Oooh, just goats... I thought it was Courtney Love singing.
To the uneducated Anti-Muslim brainwashed dumbasses. Here is Islam's and Prophet Muhammad's take on sex with animals (Bestiality):

Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: "The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: If anyone has sexual intercourse with an animal, kill him and kill it along with him. I (Ikrimah) said: I asked him (Ibn Abbas): What offence can be attributed to the animal? He replied: I think he (the Prophet) disapproved of its flesh being eaten when such a thing had been done to it.  (Translation of Sunan Abu-Dawud, Book 38, Number 4449)
Jimmy Kimmel sent me!
I really hope there's a goat that can scream like Hacksaw Jim Duggan.
0:59 reminds me of CR7
Like if You came here from K-391.
Just made my day
yep... the voice doesn't match the face.
Have the lambs stopped screaming?
That second one screaming ! LOL! I can't stop laughing at this!
K-391 anyone?
K-391 made a song out of this lol
yeaaah
welp i watched this in school and then i watch it now what is going on with my life???
Not all of these are goats, they're also Suffolk and cross-bred sheep. Not all sheep are white and fluffy.
this is funny
You know what. It makes sense to me now.

No kidding religion believed goats were the symbol of the devil because of there frightening(yet hilarious) human sounding scream.
2:03 the dog just turned and probably looked at him/her thinking, "what have you brought in?" 😂
That's not creepy at all...
Yas
Aaaargh my tummy hurts...! - personal fav: The one around 1:37 where some goats "baaah" like they're supposed to, and then the overcoat one answers "RAAAAAAH!" like some kind of psycho. AAAahahahahahah-heheeheheeheeheheh...
What is the name of the video that the clip at 1:40 is from?
Did it really?
The goat from 1:42 - 1:58 sounded like a gas powered rc car

that last one. it's like yeah.
They scream like human !! I will never eat goat again !!!
1:13 that goat is me after school on fridays :3
The real reason why Goats scream like humans: the goat actually shrunk the humans down to the size of a mouse and swallowed them whole. Thus, when the goat opens his mouth, it is really the human screaming inside the goat.
LOL 0:21 Will Smith scream...
When u hear a goat make a sonic exe scream its game over.
Had me crying... Wtf
The dog at the end is like Wtf
1:41 killed me
1:23 was my favorite xD
Because why not argue with a goat.
It's weird to think that the world's most awkward animal is Satan's symbol. These creatures here are the devil's people.
0:21
funny
haahaha
Too many Muslim-Haters out there, were all humans!
maybe they're actually people who are now screaming in agony to be turned back.
There was an ad at the beginning of the video with the screaming goats about sprint apoligizing to verizon and atmt
Never not funny XD
Waffles
Moar movie previews plox.
What's funny is that so many humans think these are all goats...some are sheep.
Reasons why i want goat😂
If I didn't the source, I would have thought somebody just fell.
Is this evolution? Next thing we know, goats are gonna be talking to us...
Sometimes when people die they become goats. This is them calling out for help
They are reenacting the sound they hear when the MUSLIMS blow their load inside........

Reminds me of when Peter Griffin refuses to take back the monkey from the island because they wanted to teach it sign language to tell tales of their stay.

They eat them so the goat cannot tell...
😱 so sad. if only thay learned haw so Baca
Lol
1:37-1:43
That other goat was like " look at those two idiots "
and those two goats were like " SHUT THE F*CK UP "
I find the poor Shepherd's ears flattening at the end the funniest part hahaha

lolz the best one 1:40
I've seen this a thousand times
Even though I'm just a secretary, I've seen things most mortal beings won't, something above this world of ours. It all started when I was heading back home after work. I saw a human wearing a paladin armor, he was just sitting on the floor, petting a goat. When I got closer, he looked at me, and said: "Unown, you are the chosen one for this world." Before I could even respond, he and the goat disappeared. Needless to say, I was confused as hell. But it all made sense in my dreams. The Paladin along with the Goat of the New World appeared in front of me, they showed me the Goat. The enlightenment, the joy of playing Battletoads. That dream showed me what true happiness is. All they wanted in return was for me to be the prophet of this world, the one that will spread the word of the Goat to everyone. There is no heaven, there is no hell. There is only the Goat. Ever since that dream, my main duty in my mortal life is to be the Goat's prophet. My friends and family have already accepted the Goat, and soon this town and everywhere else will accept her as well. Just thinking about it makes me cry... but don't worry, I'm not sad. I'm happy.
Darude - Sandstorm.

Goats may be cute when they're little bit let me tell you they are DISGUSTING creatures. It's funny how pigs are stereo typed as the nasty one's. :P

I happen to own a goat. They poop eve-ry-where all the time. They smell horrible because they owe on thier beards to attract mates. And if you've heard that exsprestion "horny as a goat", it's true. All the animals that were living in our backyard with him ran away because they were tiered of being "used".
I cant even deal right now
"baa-aa-aa WAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGGGHHH HELP ME I'M TRAPPED IN A GOAT'S BODY!!!"
i dont know if to laugh or cry, some of them dont look happy ( sorry my broken english)
Disney's Pinocchio had it all wrong... the boys go to Pleasure Island and become goats, not donkeys!!!
Yeaaah XD

1:23 - 1:36 is the funniest thing I've ever seen. It's like they're having a conversation and it's like "u wot m8?", especially the last time...
THE LAST ONE HOLY FUCK I CANT BREATH 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Some of these are lambs smh
Goat simulator 2014 in a nutshell.
I love this video I laugh every time I watch it
1:43 hahahaha they sounded like men
How did I end up here?
This is literally impossible to watch without laughing. Pure fucking comedy.
the dog at the very end was like "no way...he just broke the rules"
1:47 it's sounds like and old man
They must be humans reincarnated as goats...
I laughed so hard I cried.
I don't usually laugh very hard at all.
People please learn your farm animals!! The first one is 2 GOATS with man and woman. Second is a SHEEP! Third is a brown and white GOAT. Fourth is a brown GOAT. Fifth is a tan GOAT with white on his head. Sixth is a brown GOAT and black GOAT. Seventh is a SHEEP! Eighth is the interview with a GOAT. Ninth is 3 SHEEP in blankets! Tenth is a Goat. The very last one is a SHEEP!!!!!
Why? Why this video have 24 m views? lol
MOMMMM
Wahahahaha.
1:23 BEST!
2:01 Are you cool?
Putas Cabras están locas
this is where goat simulator comes in
How does a video with so much fake shit in it get such a high like/dislike ratio?
buuuuuuuuuuuuh!
The last one is so funny
I almost just went insane from the hilarity
FFFFFFFFuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyy
1:37 that scream is too human O_O
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark and hear the screaming of the goats.
Why...What would make such a creature emit such a horrible noise like this? The goat at 1:13 looks like he doesn't even know where or what he is anymore. What kind of fence is he behind? Is he in some kind of concentration camp for goats? God help them. Jesus save them. I pray everyday
Better than my video's! - I can't quite make out weither they're saying "Help!"  "Yeah! ", or if ther're shrieking with disgust as if being touched somewhere.
Wow...they're evolving so fast!!..watch out for goat

The last one is better than the rest
do you ever wonder if goats are the souls of people who went to hell and now have to serve time as a goat, so we're basically laughing at someone's call for help

like half life
some of these were edited with real voices.
That last goat tho
Hmmmm, am I the only one here who realizes that not all of the animals shown in this video are goats? There are a number of sheep too. Please simply update the video name to PART 2 of "Goats and Sheep Yelling Like Humans". I feel rather embarrassed for you otherwise.
these aren't actually goats they're humans that have been morphed into an animal by witchcraft they are crying for help to be noticed
Beeeehehehehe... AAAAAAGH!
1:52 Is that a Goatling ?
thes are elians not goats!!!!
2:01  yeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaah
most of these are fake
Goats. Goats Everywhere. They yell like we do. Are we now goats? Are goats now us? Just don't ever give the Goats an E. They wouldn't like it, and you wouldn't like it either...
2:01 "YEAHH"
that last pne though
Who's excited for Goat Simulator, these guys are lol
What if those goats. Were human once and they're just realizing they have been turned to goats
The very first goat was screaming like something or someone was raping it
1:38 is just the best one.
the last one is fake.
These are the goats you can play in Goat Simulator.
Those "wahooooo!!"s (like the second clip) sound fake. Can anyone confirm those are actually real? It's pretty hilarious.
Lmao :49 Bob! Bob! Bob!

Thats me yelling at my mom to take me to school
2:07 : LOL "YEAH"
Dat ending cad
ill save you all the trouble 1.13 loool
Read this entire message.....Place the thought of what it says into your mind and watch this video again and tell me if I'm wrong......about this:

Imagine for a second that when you die INSTEAD of going to HELL if you were bad in this lifetime, Imagine being immediately warped into the existence of a goat with all of your memories and human understanding intact but WITHOUT the ability to tell anybody or prove to anybody who you really are.....I bet this is what it would sound like
So I'm becoming more and more of a firm believer that in every single goat on earth is an actual human consciousness trapped and forced to live out one or many lifetimes (depending on how bad you were) as a goat. Getting sacrificed a few times....then attacked by a wolf another.......beat up by other goats who bullied you in real LIFE and recognized you as a goat.. 0:24 . "AAAsgghhhhhhhhaaah."......lol    The possibilities are endless.
yelling Goats are awesome...
Last one is fake. Sounds like Patrick Star
i got a few of these myself if you want some to compile again
ohhhhhhhhh  this made me laugh my ass off  made my fucking day lol
i love the last one'
2:00 DERP
2:01 YEAAAH
1:51 is the best haha
That German Shepherd at the end... Totally nonplussed. "Yeah, that's my pal the goat. He yells now and then. No big."
1:27 actually looks like a real person HAHAHAHAHA
It was funny when the goat said "yeah" at the very end.

One problem with this Video, several of the goats are SHEEP.
@1:52 and the one after = the beast  #goats
I think the disrespectful goat is the funniest, the one who spits in his face.
Imagine how freaky it would be if they had tongues shaped like human tongues. "Please don't eat me." A good question further; would we still eat them?

Thanks man,video had some issues loading so I thought I should check the comments.Saved my life!
I'm really in a bat HABIT checking videos like this out...

I think this is proof that all goats are just dressed up humans yelling and pretending to be goats.  This is what James Bond actually does for surveillance
that was cute:)
0:50 BOB!!!
youtube.com/watch?v=D8Ymd-OCucs&hd=1
The Last One Sounds Like Lorde's Song Tennis Courts
I think goats have evolved themselves to yell like humans for survival. So that when a human tries to kill them they yell like humans do so as to melt their heart.
Sounds like my roommate during his Crohn's disease.
Thanks!
01:30 i would most-likely be the goat

0:21 Segs, the best!
Wtf jajaja
last one said yeaaaaaaaah
Dafuq?
I think they actually were humans at some point, but some malevolent trickster god turned them into goats because they were cruel to a goat, or something. This is them screaming for help, or perhaps mercy, as they feel the last lingering threads of their humanity slipping away. All we do is say, "Haha, that goat sounds like a person," film them, and put them on YouTube, completely oblivious to their sanity-rending terror and agony.
i'm not sure about this being real or not, but i really want it to be real
Nah, it sounds like a man.
I, masturbated on that 5 minutes ago.... no regrets!

They're reincarnations from humans in previous lives. Occasionally they'll be shocked by realisations of what they've become and yell out for help.

Karma will even things for anyone in this life or the next :)
1:52 - I wonder what that goat has been thinking at that moment
1:40

Ehhhh 4/10 would still sacrifice to Lord of the Underworld.
1:42 THE BEES!!!!
que opina usted del gobierno de Zapatero: aaaaaarrrrrggggghhhhhhh xD
Firstly, I didn't say it for the sake of humour. If anyone or anything spits in my my face, I'm not gonna just stand there and take it. I sure as hell wouldn't let a person do it to me, so why should I find it acceptable for an animal to?

Secondly, again, you are getting way, way bent out of shape here.   "Go and eat your fucking mother?" Seriously? I made a comment about a goat, I repeat, A GOAT, and that's what you come to me  with? Not cool, man.
No wonder why stereotypical demon has goat horns.
It is no funny, it is insensitive. Go and eat your fucking mother.
Imagine if goats were carnivores, they could've used this method to wipe out humanity!
last one fake?!
Anytime bro.
Your comment made this video funny. Thank you.
What're you getting bent out of shape about? Is it your goat or something?
Fuck you
If a goat spat in my face like that, I'd be eating mutton for dinner that night.
00:21 either this is dubbed, or crazy af!! Hahah
Terrifying and hilarious at the same time.
I know that feel.
Does anyone else want a goat now?
1:22 is something straight out of Star Wars. The goat is a local shopkeeper in Mos Eisley, Tatooine and the guy is trying to barter with him, and the goat just spits in his face.
0:24 xD
I think those goats are broken
MOOOOOM!!! MOM!!! MOOOOOM!
this is probably what we sound like to them...they're just imitating us

You are very bonita!

Last goat: ...... YEAH ....
Lets kill them now
1:23 U MAD? :D

Most of the kiss born in the late 80's early 90's are spirit animals of goats. and the scottish, and poor black goat farmers, and the rich and elite are also a little goatlike( but they are able to afford horses ,too)
Somebody put some metal music over this

We had a goat at school that would yell too but it wasn't so loud (definitely not even  close to being as loud as the roosters and chickens) but it was so cute. Unfortunately some asshole parents came to the school and saw all the poop so we had to get rid of the animals. Animals shit, really you didn't know that?

I feel your pain. I have so much potential, too. We should start a support group.
If I owned a goat like that I wouldn't know whether to laugh or beat the shit out of it.
great clip, I didn't know goats could make these sounds.   Can I get a copy for a gag video I'm making at work?
The last one is actually a fake. Search the "yeah lamb".
Actually it is. the second goat screaming was just an audio clip of a screaming man dubbing the goat. the rest was real.
it fills me with such joy
What have I done?
1:38
...I can't even explain it.
The other goats have a regular sound and he's just like..
"GROWN MAN VOICE!"
is not fake

You are the man who stares at goats yelling.
The one at 1:14 gets me every time.

I'm displeased. My step-brother lives in the neighboring room and he over recent weeks got great at attracting females. He went to the Master Attraction website (Search in Google) by Jake Ayres. All he's doing now is banging women. He's always having the hottest women back and I hear it, which is gross. I wish he never discovered that site. My friend just signed up and got a blowjob a week later.
0:45 did he ever find bob?

Tortured souls are trapped in goats.
What am i doing with my life.
but they had goats and later I heard on the radio that goats can make that noise haha
I had to go to this farm once for a phone service call and me and my supervisor were presurveying the job and all of a sudden I heard screams.  They were far away but I thought they were coming from inside the house and I said to my supervisor "did you hear that? It sounds like someone is being tortured in there"...we never met with the owners, just checking something quick and took off but was like "maybe we should call the cops"
1:11-1: 21 my fav!!!

It frustrates me how people say this is fake! D: Even though goats rarely make 'screaming' sounds, unless they are super distressed---THEY DO! I promice!
This should be a test. If you don't laugh, you need antidepressants.
1:45 sounds like me when i have to go to school!
I want a goat for christmas
My classmates laughed when I told them I would get rid of fat with Trim Fat Maximizer, but then they saw the results. Google Trim Fat Maximizer to see their reaction. (You should see their faces!)

0:30  You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?
i have a physics lab due tomorrow. what the fuck am i doing here
These aren't actually goats. These are people who have been trapped in the bodies of goats as  a punishment for liking Justin Beiber.
go home, you're drunk
Your comment makes you stupid.
LMFAO @1:15 1:20 1:24 1:40
The German Shepard at 2:03.   He's all like...wtf?
Lol
Lol
omg, that last one seriously cannot be real. if it is, where can i buy a goat like that?
I can't fucking wait til I'm a goat then - what a life. You get to walk around naked, eat shit and scream and people love you.
1:25 ''Bitch out of my face !''
WATCH MY GOATS PEOPLE ;) /watch?v=yE7P-vvPBvU
Nothing like this xDD
These are amazing, but they would be better if they weren't filmed with potatoes
the goat at 1:23 is a fucking menace
it is
that last one can't be real
Yaa
I love the last one
0:45 MUM!!!!!!!
0:23 that goat is my favourite one :D
That last one has to be fake

What emberhair wrote was creeping as hell because thats what I feeling
Yeeeaah lol
1:24 is when i lost it
Yeah
HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
hahahahahahahahaahaaaaaaaaaaahaahaahaahahaahaaaaah
Clearly, these goats are the human sinners of god transformed into goats who are screaming for salvation from their everlasting torment.
Fucking sick tune
What if when we die we are reborn as goats, and this is merely our grandparents trying to communicate?
I lost it at 0:57
if you say so...
chequen este video /watch?v=PpccpglnNf0
0:43 bob!!!!
I'm done trying to talk to you.  Oh and I wasn't talking smack.
you're so smart, you should know what im talking about. 2nd of all, you replied to MY question so.. 3rd, you didnt even have a question. you were talking smack the whole time.
1:24 what the fuck is that goat's problem?!
Maybe you should be a little more specific.  But how you're talking it sounds like it. But you didn't answer my question about the other guy, go bug someone else.
thats not what i meant, "hating on someone" is what i was talking about
A comeback means the art of replying to an insult with a witty word, statement or sentence.
what??? did you hear yourself? do you kow what that even means?
Nice come back.  Why are you hating on me instead of the guy who said RIP english?
lmbo  you guys  crack me up. If you understand it you shouldnt even care. and im not reading that whole essay speech of your complaint. i read the last sentence and your overeacting big-time. what are gonna do "press charges" or "sue me".
makes you look stupid
LMAOOO@ 1:25
At 1:25 the man is actually asking the animal what he thinks of a certain politician
That's not even hypocritical. But why do we care if we understand it?
Language exists for understanding. For communicating with others. Were I to speak Greek, you would stare at me with a look of confusion much as I looked at my monitor with confusion upon seeing your original comment.
If you wish to speak a language, don't speak it in chopped up, twisted versions. SOME variations are okay like "ur" online, but not that twisted Devil Tongue you spoke.
What's wrong with being a hippocrite
why were there sheep?
evolution!! they started doing this so people wont f them anymore..
My face hurts from laughing soo hard!! I'm legit crying right now. LOLOL
I like tthe last goat so much!!!! XD
whose business are you minding?
That 2nd goat can scream like homer
What am I doing with my life...
Man, people argue about goats now?! Are you not watching this?! Lol
1:23 XD
What are you trying to prove?!
The last one was funny I'm on floor crying
Good translation lol
why do you care if you understand it?
your're so smart cuz you know its english, not smart enough to notice you understand it though?
hippocrite
The last goat made me lol
1:24 a "fuck you" spit on the face goat-" SHUT THE FUCK UP
guy-"why do you have to be such a dick?"

guy-"but"

LMAO 0:24 sounds like will smith in fresh prince of bel air
Neither do you it seems
no one cares about your goats.
They forgot how to goat.
Yes I heard that to but figure hay..they are closely related but goats are way smarter.I have read that some studies have matched their intelligence with dogs. Nigerian Dwarves are even smarter and bond with you.  They get jealous for your attention and touch.  They love getting scratched on the back.  Most places allow Dwarves as pets.  They are cleaner than dogs. We have one that jumped a 6 foot fence with the help of a 4 foot house...but 6 feet down the other side!!..just to get in with us.
Yes.  I have been raising goats for years and  I still freak out and think a human is screaming sometimes. Their voice box is similar to ours. They are remarkable creatures. Goats were likely domesticated thousands of years ago along with dogs. Certain Dogs are very protective and gentle with goats.  We have a mini horse right now and he runs the heard and is a great security guard.He really thinks of them as his heard, keeps them in the pen at night and gets pissed off when there is a threat.
We raise goats and I sleep in a music studio located smack in the middle of their yard.  Every morning they wake me up by beating on the out side walls..every one..and we have 20 right now... all know their names and will answer you accordingly.  I say "Hi Ivory" and Ivory answers back.  I say "hi peanut" and peanut answers back. They all have a distinct voice.  I can tell you who it is with my eyes blind folded.  They are very loving gentle and funny creatures.
ROFLMAO 2:00
1:24
Do people actually think this is real ??? lmfao
Omg this is just fucked up i laughed so hard lmfaooo!
0:22 & 1:16, that's not a goat...they mixed in a bit of sheep screaming

And what about humans singing like goats? Funny song at YT ... /watch?v=jzJb9IozKSU
Andy Murray must be interested in goats - Scotish heritage; or was he thinking about PseudoFed.
A-men to that, I say
2:00 okay billy, so did you take the cookie?

This can't be real..lol

Some of them sound like they're yelling for help
I'm laughing so hard that my guts are flying out of me!
That last goat XD "yeeeeaaaah"
I just subscribed hilarious
Too funny my face hurts from laughing. I look forward to seeing that grumpy goat on more political debates.
He's saying: what do you think of the Zapatero administration (former president of Spain)?

This is funny, don't matter how many times you watch it hah!
You cannot *yell
Silly goat. You cannot laugh. You are not human........ so they said
what if theres a curse that turns men into goats and the only way they can actually speak is screaming o.O
yeah if you have double dropped acid!!!!
1:15 is a sheep, not a goat...I think

1:25 OHHH Goat: 1- Guy: 0
I'm pretty sure the scream ones are fake, they're all the same sound. The "Yeah" one seems unrealistic too. It's too small to have that low of a voice. Also, some of them are sheep ;)

In Africa they believe people can turn themselves into goats. a group of villagers had the police arrest a goat claiming a witch doctor who had just robbed them had morphed into a goat in order to escape... so... yeah... >_> maybe?? lol

The best ones are the ones with multiple normal sounding goats...and then there's that one
I love the last goat
Virgin and mentally retarded.
of course it has to be a black sheep yelling 'YEAH' at the end...
Thats me When i'm bored 2:00
I know how to use the word! Thanks for your concern though! It was an exaggeration. In other words it was really funny!
I love goatsssss!!!!
LOLZ LIKE I'M NOT LYING I ACTUALLY LOL'ED
AND AT TE END IT WAS SO CUTE BUT WIERD
1:39 - Boondock Goats.
last goat is black and has a deep voice saying yeeea wtf
What a majestic creature
All the neighbors probably think people are being murdered XD
I'm betting you probably didn't "literally" laugh your ass off. Learn how to use the word!
What are you talking about?
Please excuse his mental illness. Martin Bott (wwwtotalitaerde) is suffering from a psychosis that makes him believe the government is after him, controlling minds everywhere etc. >_> His allegedly murdered brother even went to court against him because he didn’t want him to use his name for that nonsense. Now he sticks to defaming my country in Youtube videos. He’s a madman and wants to make his shitty conspiracy-homepage look important.

Info:

3x "w" superiorman DOT de SLASH MartinBott.doc
go away
Fake and gay.
Brilliant vid so funny :-D
2:00 YEEEAAAAHHHHH
1:23 wtf
1:24 is the best it's like 
men who is speaking:this is a beautiful goat!
goat:(sneezes on him) 
for me that means the goat meant to shut up the men.
Kuaaaajajajajajaj me meoooo!!!!
Check out my channel and homepage. I found an official report from 1944 where a US pilot reported being attacked with radiation weapons inducing currents into the ignition and electrical system of his aircraft. This happened near Frankfurt. Thats the first confirmed report on open military use of directed energy. The earliest use for torture was in 1908, see chapter Psychiatrie-->Klinik der Narkolepsie on my homepage.My brother Markus Bott had been tortured and murdered to shut down our homepage
1:36 Cover up the video. Could be a man argueing with his wife
1:23 hahahahahahahahahaha
*together* WHAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!! :D
the last one omg
1:20 "MOOOOOM" sounds like it´s calling his mother :D
I fucking lost it at 1:25. Brilliant!
Help i forgot how to goat
sounds like the one at 0:51 is yelling mom!
THIS CUTE ;D
LOL
First, goats become viral for fainting, and now, they're viral for screaming.
I think they might be trying to warn us that something TERRIBLE is about to happen.
because that one's a voice over. most of the rest are real
that's deep. Lol.
***WARNING** DONT watch this while you are studying for finals in the library. People will simply scream at you for laughing too loud.....you have been warned....
เชี้ยไร หว่านิ เสียงยังกับควายถุกเชือด
Yeeeeeaaaaaaah.
i think i heard a goat saying godegoge at 1:53
You keep using that word, but I don't think you know what it means.
uauuuu! noaptea mintii!
WWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!
Sounds like they're saying mom! By the way I literaly laughed my ass of watching this!
The second one was definitely the best lol.
1:23 was the funniest thing ever
They have a future in making foley noises for movies.
The Wilhelm Scream is certainly popular, but these goats have character.
Frankly we need some more "Scream Sound Libraries" to pad out many of our movie entertainment needs and these goats could fill up a number of suitable scream audio files to be sold as a package.
2:00 homer simpson
0:42-1:12 sounds like a black guy getting raped
0:25
Just for clarity, a number of these are sheep, and yes they do  make these sounds and more... so much more! LOL
I want 1:45 for a pet. He is adorable. The pathetic goat at 29 kills me too. He is hilarious. He is broken, for sure. Or he needs new batteries.

he said "Sapataro, what is your opinion, Sapataro?" The goat spits him and he says "he's better then me" and something about a channel. He then says "from the Island of Eukaliptis" or something like that. I don't really understand what he is saying but he was probably on air at that time.

After that, he is asking the goat about Canary Islands Government, which is the place where it was made the "interview" xD
1:17 jar jar binks

I think the goat at 0:21 wants to let us know he just found out that his balls were removed...
best one 1:22!
I was watching Cry. How did I get here?
2:02 YEEEEEAH!
1:37 - Best one by far.
He is asking the goat what he thinks of our old Spanish president, obviously the goat tells him that he was the worst we had in our modern history.
The dog in the end of the last one xD
there are not just goats, but sheeps too. but really adorable video ^^
He speaks Spanish and they are talking about politics and the awful economical situation in Spain. It is a very interesting and wise conversation in fact XD. It summarizes everything!

Lol, 2:02, the dog is just like
"What just happened?!"
0:43 "BOB! BOB! BOB!!" guess he hasn't found Bob yet.
Well done captain obvious.
He was making a joke...
0:28 HAH GAAY
It's obvious they're people that were trapped in goats and they're screaming for help.
I love GOATS!  but now you can see why I got rid of the two I had as a teenager! they woke me at daylight !! ;)
YEEAAHHH

1:53 oh my god thats frickin adorable

2:02- Goat: "Yeah"
       - Dog: "WTF?"

When you're down ... and weary - watch goats yelling like humans.

Who knows why it is just so freaking hilarious :-D
1:45 sounds like Steve Carell!
LOL Right at 1:24 hahaha can't stop replaying! :D

Then be prepared for the poop machine, no joke their like a chain gun!(ewww)
1:33 is the best.
that last one made me cry a little.
1:39 gets me every time.
1:23 XD
That goat sounds like an old man at 1:33. Maybe he turned into a goat after he died?
this video is WONDERFUL
1:24 omg :D i cant.. :D
Thousands of years of evolution and we're sitting here and entertain ourselves with the goats...=_)
2:01 YEAH !

It's becoming popular now though.
1:37 is the best
the high-pitch screaming ones are mega fake though
Good point. Personally, I still think it's fake. But whatever.  People believe what they want either way.
Did you know that goats actually have regional dialects and accents like people do?  It is true!
My neighbor and the kids would sound like babies and the adults would sound like full grown men. Some days you would think he was running some sort of torture chamber over there.
I like the last 5
hahaha! Oh my god, that last one xD

Ah. It would appear you are correct. However, some noises my goats make are pretty odd, haha
maybe some of it, but i think most of it is real
@Diana Palmer Yeeah, you keep telling yourself that and, maybe it will come true.
this is better then harlem shake
It sounds like Steve Carrell doesn't it?
this is better than harlem shake
1:43 is the best!
NOW IM LYING IN THE COLD HARD HAY MEEEEEEH
0:43-53 Baaaaah-b oh baaaaah-b
The second to last one sounded like an old guy falling down a flight of stairs.
I think that 1:37 is better
My favorite part was 0:54
"YEAH"

So funny! Shame the second goat is totally busted as fake.
1:40 sounds like 2 bros
LMFAO!!!!!
Noosssa mto legaau adoreei :D
Thats very cool! But it´s not very strange; espicialy goats have very strange voices and sounds often like screaming people when they bleats. The worst is that once they have begun, it takes a very long time before they stop...
That screaming lady one seems faked. There are unnatural stops in the sound.
Now I understand why goats are traditionally portrayed as Satan's creatures. Metal as fuck.
Did anyone else feel the urge to buy a goat after this?
I lose my shit at 1:40
That's how it all started with the screaming goats songs THUNBS UP
Maybe they just wanna see their meathook friends again ...
Awsome ending
its a frigging sheep
Are they all calling for their friend Bill?
At 1:41 I thought that goat had 2 heads.
You were retarded from the start.
1:04 :') cutest thing in this freakin world.
Omg I was busting up through the whole thing xD And that last goat...oh wow SO unexpected! Lmao!
This never gets old!!
WTF XD
Im on the weird side of YouTube again
they re yelling "HELP!" :-(
lol....he's like wtf was that?
2:00 that dog is like "Where did that come from? It couldnt have been that thing.."
Fake or not, the second one has me in tears.
*Goat yells* Yo, I think it's got terets.
reincarnation gone wrong lol
poor goats they were once human
0:24 wtf a goat can yell like that?!?!
I'm in tears right now. Can I work on a goat farm?
The second one is fake... I used the same sound  effect on a video....
LMAOOOOO
LOL oh my sides

Dave Grohl brought me here!  (SXSW) 2013 Keynote Speech

Damn...I was hoping you were :(

Hell yeah!!!
Finebros brought me here!
I agree ;)
in 'youtubers react' you can see that the second goat is also fake.. just a sound effect ;)
I guess this is funny to someone who has never been around goats.  But having lived with a herd of 30 for awhile, this is normal behavior for them.
only the last one.... ever actually seen a goat?
3/4 of these are fake...
Grohl sent me.

What the fuck is wrong with these goats!
Er, they ain't all goats, I saw some sheep and some type of ox or cow in the mix. I'd recognize sheep as I'm a shepherdess, and I have a goat for milking. But it is interesting to see, I'll give ya that.

natural selection will favor goats with human like bleats because they'll have less chance to be slaughtered by humans for meat because of the sympathy  :P

The last one makes me lose it. "Yeahhhhh" while the dog is silently freaking out.
I am serious, I'm literally crying of laughter best fun for years.
Now my throat is sore
hahahah i almost pissed myself that was so funny!
1:13 is fake as hell. It has the same exact scream as the original screaming goat and look at how the freaking camera is all set up in HD. Bullshit. Or should I say goatshit.
1:23 was hilarious though.

made my day already:D
the absolutely best at 1:40!! :D
1:25 i'd punch that fucker in the face!
yyeeeeeeeaaaaaaaa
Haven't laughed so hard in such a long time!!!!!!
Geez! More than two goats seem to have an obsession with Bob :D Who is this Bob guy anyways? Bob the Builder??
I watched this today at Japanese everyone was laughing so hard after we all finished the class ned door came over and we were in complete silence
check this out - /watch?v=x1W9gE18o6o
I laughed so hard I got tears haha!
To all the people saying "THESE ARE ALL FAKE!!!!!" some of them might be, but the majority of them aren't.
I guess this happens after too many goats got screwed by farmers :<
He actually was not saying anything wrong, he was asking for his thoughts on the government lol
I could watch this all day
most of these are so fake that it hurts..
they all sound so crazy
1:44 sounds like it has burned its tongue
He was talking about Zapatero's administration in Spain, so yeah, basically something vulgar.
NASA needs to include this on exploration satellites. If there is life on anther planet, they really should see this.
1:47 the goat sound mentally retarded!! lol rofl
first man to ever argue with a goat 1:24
that last goat was on steroids
"yeaah"
is this real? how is this real?
2:01 .... come on really? lol
0:44 sounds like he's screaming "MOM"!!!!!!!!
ههههههههههههههههههههههه اه يابطني
hhhhhhhhhhhh lool
Satan!
YEEAAAAH
I am convinced that a human was turned into a goat and can talk
If we just could teach them to yell help we could do some great stuff.
Great video.
you're a creepy muthafucka
Not trying to send any kind of message here, but most North Americans don't know that this is what a goat sounds like when you slit its throat. But it's a common way of killing them for their meat.

(I'm Mexican-American and I've had uncles slaughter goats like that. And for me it was pretty traumatizing.)
2:03 YEAH lol!
The one at 1:20 reminds me of Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove
1:24 i can't breathe
1:26 Is clearly saying, 'wha?' Not an Spanish speaking animal then.
0:25 was definitely my favorite
if you listen to the second to last one it sounds like a dirtbike... O_O
This is photoshopped. I can tell because I can hear the pixels.
2:00 LMFAO!!!!!!!! :)
MOST OF THESE ARE FAKE!!
The goat and the man had conflicting points of view on politics at 1:23 lol
The derpy one at the end was funny
xD the goat would have so beat up the man if he could get out his cage
Ok the ones that look kinda shaved with the long necks and no horns, they have that kind of high pitched scream that sounds just like me when I scream. Is that real? It kind of sounds like someone inserted the audio on that one.
Dammit Zoey...
Lots of these are definitely fake
1:23 is definitely the best.
I forgot how to goat lol
1:45; he's so awesome. He's like a scared little boy
THE LAST ONE. OMG
1:15 super drool
1:16 then the dance!
0:29 Wingardium Leviosaaaaaahh
HAHAHA
xoaoxaoxaoxaxoaxax aoxoaixaxa
1:23 bahahaha i think i died a little ^.^
1:23 , the face of indignation... ahahaha
Good observation Sherlock..
The one at 1:24, he was asking the goat what does she think about Zapatero´s goberment (Spain's expresident).... I get why the goat acted like that.
a bunch of these are fake
1:16 that looks more like a sheep
1:14 that goat reminds me to eddy murphy
1:23 What???? What??? What??? What??
1:38
I forgot how to goat
1:43  "Too much habanero"
and this is the secret to how goats lure humans into their traps.. and eat them as a bloodthirsty hoard of screaming demons....
the most majestic little sits ever
1:23 wtf :D
0:22 and 1:15 are sheep....dumbass
this is horrible.
LMAO!
These are hilarious except a few after the first screaming one and the second white screaming one could have definitely been edited out..
the last one !!! :DDD
I could almost agree with you but half of them don't look like they're "trapped" at all so...
The screaming ones are fake. Especially the first one. You can tell it's been dubbed over. Stupid
1:23 was fking hilarous haha
0:43 BOB! BOB!
 I wonder if he ever found Bob?
ha
All except the last one of course...
The dogs reaction at the last goat is priceless. xD
The last one!! and the second one and the one where a goat is arguing with the human... make me LOL!
Yet they sound better than most singers today,,,
These goats have a throat infection or something?
they are screaming "HELP!" yet we find it funny. . . LOL
I lol'd at 0:26
1:44 this is the best one :D
German Shepherd: uhh. Did u hear that?
Goat sound like frat boys.
Translation of all the goats: CATHERINE!!!

Like a BOSS
This isn't dubbed, right?  These animals are actually making these noises?
I was looking for Justin Beiber...and this is what I found.

The goat that spat in the guys face sounded intelligent almost
Lmao the last one is too much <3
That last one man, all the other ones are funny don't get me wrong, but that last one, always takes the wind out of me.
:43 sounds like it's yelling "MUUUUM!!"  hahahaha had me dying

Damn kids.

Now that you put it that way, it doesn't seem so bad.

So this is what my life has come to. Watching videos of goats scream like people.
Abraham Close this is the noise your mom makes
0:24 EPIC!!
funny!
Lol at the one at the end. "yeaaaaah"
I completely lost it at the last one
:55 and 1:37 are the funniest. I can't stop laughing. You can tell this isn't fake because you can see their ears go back shaking as they're screaming.

@officiallyawakened  you sound fucking crazy. I sincerely hope you're joking because if youre not, someone should commit it
*Spit*
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
The 3rd Goat looks like Jimmy Kimmel!
AAAHHH!!!
"What can I do for you" haha very cool.
I just found the OP for all the ones I though were fake, and they are.  @AjQ2891 has four videos, and the last one's not in this compilation, probably because it's not believable at all.
And they proceed to have an argument xD
The sheep at 0:23 and the one at 1:15 have the same scream.  Probably fake.
1:40 Statler and Waldorf as goats
you're a bloody idiot
1:23 is the BEST goat clip ever
Ok.....scariest shit ive ever seen. Background knowledge: scientists have been putting human stem cells in goats, and other animals, and now theyre screaming like humans. Theyre also being born everywhere with human faces. Just holy shit dude! This is not funny. This is a fucking wake up call!
lmao the dogs face in that last clip
They're cute AND delicious...?
Seriously though, if you'd eaten goats, you would never ask why people eat goats. They're sooooo tasty.
After 10 straight hours of watching goat videos, it begins to get a little creepy ... but the one at the end ALWAYS makes me laugh.
ahhaha wtf
best in the world
1:23 HILLARIOUS
aint nobody got time for spanish
حشيش
Последний козёл самый лучший!
А чё нормально так!!!
There's so cute, how can you eat these guys?
Is there a goat edition of this video?
HAHA!SO　FUNNY
0.28 ♥♥♥♥♥
last is best YEAH
GOATS are GOAT
1:23 is a great metaphor for an average internet argument. The man represents anyone trying to reason their point of view, and the goat represents your average dipshit.
the goat at 0:23 feels fake. By that I mean listen to the sound. You hear all this noise going on in the back then it just kind of dims and then cuts out right when the scream is about to happen. It then goes back to normal sound. I think someone dubbed an actual scream over the video of the goat.
The screams from hell right here
The last one omg too funny!!
0:23 gets me every time.
WAAAARGH!
from :43-:53 sounds like its yelling mom
has anyone thought that maybe the goats are actually humans stuck inside a goat's body........
Whats more is the argument that ensues after he spits in his face haha.
yeas, me thanks your ;)
I feel so bad for them
00:27 that one makes me burst in tears laughing so hard hahahah
I am laughing so hard right now
1:36 gave me nightmares!!!! It's so creepy how they yell
0:28 Professor McGonagall has transformed into a goat...

You WILL die at 0:23!
SKDHFOTSSTSYCKVPXTZOTZOYXJOXITZ
i think the one at 1:44 is the best, to me it sounds like a retard goat LOL
The last one makes me laugh so hard XD
These are not all goats.  4 of them are sheep.  IJS
The conversation at 1:23 is very similar to riding public transit in Los Angeles.
1:23 I WANNA BE IN THE SHOT TO SO STFU
1:23 *spits in face* YOU LIEN TO ME YOU MADE HUMP U AND THIS IS THE SOUND I MADE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Thts sum funny shit!!! Lol
1:23 LMFAO!!!! Spits in his face then yells LMAO!!
lol at the two fatass goats
The last one HAS to be fake.
"AHHHHHHH, they've turned me into a goat!"
Why am I doing this... I have stuff to do!
What if all of these are just voice overs and some guy pulled an ultimate troll? We had a debate on this in health class today haha
tears are a rolling!! damn that was funny!!
lmaolmaolmao礼貌礼貌礼貌
This shit is funny.
1:21 -Qué opina usted del gobierno de Zapatero?

Horrible creatures, sound like screaming devils! Now I understand why the Bible said that at the end of the world, God will separate the goats (screaming devils) from the sheep (peaceful angels) !
:50 sounds like a person yelling "baa" even though it's not!

My fave two was the one tht spit in the guys face (lol!!) and the one at the end :'D
This is my new favorite thing. Like seriously, I could watch this a thousand and twelve times and still laugh at it.
God certainly has a sense of humor.
The guy speaking spanish? Or the goat? Either way, neither of them sound like Steve Carrell.
Why the fuck does someone take a goat in their house?
1:24 HAS to be Steve Carrell doing a voice over. No way. Hahahahaha

The lay one is too funny
I love the spit one it killes me!
Listen, if you been around goats at all, there is always that one goat that makes the human sounds. Mostly what I have heard are the ones that sound like babies crying, but these are too funny. Yep, I don't think it's evolution, it's just them, and they are loveable and unpredictable animals, cause you never know how they gonna act.
Rofl
The second last one sounded as if it had burnt its tounge! Lol so funny!
That last one thoo
0:22 don't scream at me! You ain't my dad! D:<
1:23 walka na beszty :D
Absolutely genius! Completely lost it at 1.40
When did goats start screaming like humans?  This is news to me.  Evolution baby!
The silence of the goats
So funny.
third one: dying Medic
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
They are slowly learning to communicate through sounds lol and here we are laughing
1:17 Gave me a heart attack.
MMMMYEEEEEEAAAAHHHH-last goat had me crying
The second one was totally dubbed.
When the man was talking the goat was saying "What?"
Well, for one thing I work with samples a lot, and I kan recognize a sample coming in twice when I hear one. The exact same sound is played three times in this video, so it's fake. Some of the sounds sound exactly like hormoneexploding teenagers screaming their heads off, but yes I know goats can scream in funny ways too.
goat at 1:24 dosen't like that guy lol
Whats wrong with these goats. Fricken hilarious :D
Yeeeaaah!
hahahahhaha 1:23
1:22 was priceless.
Challenge accepted.

The guy asked the goat what he could do for him

Yeah
YEAH
...wat
I just went to the shops to get some crisps. I've got a dirty hangover. I also went into the bookies to put a bet down, the old man behind the counter asked me if I was alright and acting purely for my own satisfaction I told him to go fuck himself. The feeling of anger was born out of my suffering;  if I suffer then I want you to suffer.  He still processed my bets though and if they come in and I win I'm going to take the money and spend it on crack cocaine and get nutted.
Holy fuck
End: yeah...

1:27 the goat tries interrupting him, but nope.
these arent dubs are they? lmfao
The goat at 1:43 has down-syndrome.
I can't believe that goat spits in his face.
Just hear me out on this. What if goats yell like this to warn humans of a catastrophic event in the future. We're laughing but they're serious about this. At 1:24 the goat got so fed up with the human that he spat on him. "WHHAAAAAAT? FUCK IT!" I now have a greater respect for goats.
Maybe human souls are stuck in the goats body.
1:30 OMFG LMFAO
2:00 - "YEEEEAH" Goat.
With that Sharingan? Not for long.
Am I the only one who thinks that the last goat is the best? XD

Goats: as voiced by eddie murphy
I'm so glad I came here
I come here when I'm sad. I'm not sad for long.
Not all of them are real.
Haha stupid.
Love how the sheep bleats and then the goats scream.
XD
Lost it at 1:22
I feel like the first sheep is saying, "Ellen! Ellen! Ellennn!"
I don't know what's more creepy at the end: the way the goat says "yeah", or that stare that dog is giving
Are these all real?

That's deep.
Help, I've fallen and can't get up..the laughing, it hurts.
what if when we die, our souls get trapped in goats and all we can do is scream but no one helps us because they think its funny
So culturally, we have gone from cats falling into toilets to screaming goats. Can we go any lower?

I say yes, bring it on.
lol the 2:00 one
Some of these are sheep, not goats.  The sheep are at 0:21, 1:13, 1:37, and 2:00.  Trust me, I raise both sheep and goats, I can tell the difference between the two.
OMG this kills me
omg my heart literally jumped.

Hahahhahha loll
AHAHAHAHAHHAHA :,)
I cant stop laughing at the goats at 0:25 and 1:25
Most are real clips but 0:26, 1:16 & 1:20 are just fake audio. I'm a bit suspicious about 1:41 and the last one too. :)
oh my goat!
Holy mother of god, 1:40 has obliterated my sides
0:04 Just two people taking their goats on a leisurely stroll through the city XD
Lol at 1:22 and the the dog at 2:01.

0:22 = First time Spiderman is jumping from an building, like: Yiiiiiiiihhhuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!
1:25 is so funny :L
Leave the poor goats alone.. all they want is to connect with us. Sometimes it just takes more than screaming like a human to be a human. I'm talking to you Bieber.
Some of these are actually sheep, but I'm just nitpicking....hilarious

1:17 because he is slimey
1:17 because he is slimey :D
1:24 is the best spot in the video. The man arguing with the grumpy old goat who spit on him is hilarious! XD
Watching in class and everyone died at 0:24. Someone fell off their chair :D
Omfg! That was hilarious!!
@TheEdik1020 Yes you are the only one who thinks that. Put the paint thinner and rag away.
0:56 Ohhh shith justin biber! I yell to get rit off him!
No goats, only humans can use their vocal chords like that
Lmfao at 1:23 reminded me of the cookie monster
I died at the end!
They call their mom.
Love the guy who says, "yeah" at the end!
2:01 best!!
Best 2 minutes of my life =)
0:45 HEEELLP !
I thought about it, but that's where religion fails, as soon as I started to think.
am i the only one here who thinks that these goats have a soul of a human who died and god gave him to be a goat so they are yelling for help or to god ? O_0 really think of it
fucking hilarious
1:12 is the best, lol.
1:23 A typical conversation with my girlfriend.
OMG ahahahahahahhaaa
Thats weird, jesus brought me here.
:49 MOOOOOOM! MOOOM

The first one sounds like a Michael Jackson scream lol.
Letzte Fake, vorletzte goil! :-D
1:15 lol
Second last one sounds like Larry David
Not funny dude. 0:44 was actually a rescue party looking for a guy named Bob.
Can't you hear the grief in the goats voice? "BOOOOooOOOOB"
1:41
1:24
omg, i peed my pants
0:56 started out so normal then killed me. i literally fell out of my chair
fake
I don't understand how you can dislike this video. It's so great.
I SERIOUSLY CAN'T BREATHE. MY SIDES HURT AND MY THROAT IS GETTING RASPY. I LOVE THE FEELING OF DYING OF LAUGHTER
1:45 - Jerry Seinfeld lol
It's all those naughty kids from Pinocchio
1:24 has got to be the best one
0:44 reminds me of those kids over xboxlive yelling at their mom for something.... "MOOOM!"....... "MooOOOoOooM!"

i think they are trying to communicate
omfg ahh so awesome. made my  night
MUUUUUUUUUM!
Hahahaha EPIC!!!
The second last one is a pygmy goat probably on heat (in oestrus or ready for mating).  The black faced sheep one I suspect is a hoax  
The other goats are jus tmaking  normal goat sounds
i have seen this video so many times now, but it never gets old.
I want a goat now!!!:0
lmfao.i've only met those usual mehhhh ones hahaha
1:38 fucking rofl
I showed this to every teacher at school today. needless to say, i couldnt stop laughin
Ahah
Talyor Swift brought me here

I want a goat...
im now like 90% certain all goats are actually humans captured by circe

nothing will convince me otherwise
1:23 Every argument on the internet ever.
1:59
Mom: "yeeeah?"

In the last one the dog is like what the heck
The last one was amazing
This is so funny. I like the one that says "yeah" at the end, and the one in the Taylor swift video the most, even though they were all funny.
I have seriously watched this thing like 30 times and it just never stops getting funny
1:30 he was saying huh cause he couldnt understand and the last one goat was my  faveorite
LMFAO 0:21-0:27

LMAO the first scene all i could think is the goats are mad for pickin up their shit..and the second is just WOW at that yell lmfao
1:23 LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Last one has to be a fake..
What is wrong with 0:28? Going through puberty or something?
1:45 this is my uncle when he is drunk. no joke.
most of these arent even goats....they are sheep
not fake...if you listen to the video you can hear people laughing hysterically at the goats screaming
@ 1:44 goat sounds drunk
0:44 "mom...moooooom"
that awful screaming of the goats...
1:45 "whaaa? what? what?" lmao
Fake.

Too bad there's no "Absolutely love" button xD
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
1:12 and up i died of laughter, omg i laughed so hard
00:23 That goat is pretty much famous right now...

At the end it sounded like the Black Donkey said " yeaaaaaa" LMFBO
YEAH
Eeeee - aaaaaaaaa- eeeee
The goat at 0:24...I almost peed my pants...
Why are we laughing, their evolving!
Uhh... there's sheep in there too... 1:14 is a sheep. So is 1:40.
1:39 i fucking lost it!
Still love the confused look on the dog's face at the very end...
1:39 "You call that a yell? Lets show 'em Burney."

As a goat myself, I am offended by your comment.

1:38 I lost my s...!
1:37 lol
"what can I do for you" hahaha
Where the fuck is that topdog comment!
0:48 - MUUUUUM!!! MUUUM!!!
facebook. com/KozaNostraiAlpaki  :))
Is that last one even real?
1:15 homer simpson?
0:19 sounds like Steve carrel lol
PEGBOARD NERDS!
Some seem real, but a few just seem like they voiced it over..
I cant stop watching it lmao
loll
Brilliant!
maybe its because im high....but this has to be the funniest video i have ever watched in my life !
wait, im confused.
is this voice over? or is it real? i mean its funny either way..
DAAAAAAAAAAAADDDD
MOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM
The last one is by far my favourite!

0:14
That second goat it awesome
The last goat sounds like Patrick Star...
zinedine zidane Harlem shake SEACH IT!!!!!!!! SEARCH NOWWW
oh my fucking god the one at the end hahahahahaha
I like the ox its funny
the goat at 1:14 that screams looks just like the tall weird looking dude from new McDonalds commercial
Sounds like eddie murphy nyaha but this is freaky mann
1:46 Dude? Something wrong with your mouth? Do you need a dentist?
"i fuckin hate spanish People" 
 1:22
the goat at 1:43 is like numbed at his tongue
The blurry goat was like "Mom/Bob!"
That one goat sings backup for Taylor Swift
the one at 1:43 is the best by far !!!! LMAO
I died at 0:24 ...
1:23 CANT STOP LAUGHING
LMAO TOO FUNNY
The one at the end sounds like he is in some serious distress....OMG that whole skit is hilarious !!
For my next birthday, I'm going to ask for a goat
ah heeell no! i died around 0:28
IM LAUGHING SO HARD OH MY GOSH THIS IS GOLD, THIS IS WHAT THE INTERNET WAS MADE FOR
Okay which one of you sad bastards have been humping some goats? XD
1:14 ROCKS!!!!!!
I can't even breathe-
i lost it at the second one rofl
scary ass goats
0.21-0.30 both of these were on Russell Howard
Hahaha that white goat (1.53)
I'm assuming that all 618 people work for peta and think this is cruelty.
That last one was the BEST!!!
Awesooooome.  Thanks for sharing.
why? WHY???????
GAAAYYY. is what i heard
I have got to get a goat
The last almost made me shit myself lol
WTFF HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Idk this makes me so happy
go home,goat.youre drunk.
1:37 oh my god
1:23 Hahah The Goat Spit In The Persons Face
1:23
0:24 gets me everytime
its missing taylor swift :(
The ones that are questionable to me are the higher-pitched screams. The "yeaaaaahhh" at the end is totally edited as there is an unedited video out there. The passive-sounding "ahhh" ones sound more believable since the background noise isn't tuned out while they shout.
meanwhile in Russia...
This video is what the Internet was invented for.
Hahahahahahhahaha. 1:24. HOWLING. sounds like a drunk old man!!
Rise of the Planet of the Goats?
what the fuck did i just watch?
I think my lungs imploded from laughing! XD
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Lol 1:24 XD
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Who dislikes this? The high pitched ones are well funny.
02:00 "Yeeeaaah"
they sound nicer than pop singers
1:23 is like arguing with someone on the internet...
2nd one is fake god damn it now I can´t justify sharing this video...
The first one sounds like Jeff Bridges.
First they talk, now they type. The goats are taking over the world!
You gotta love goats
Yeeeeah -_-
LOLOOOOOOL! "AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
Right after the last goat said "yeeah", the dog was all like, "heard that?"
that's so scary omg
I want a goat now
ohmagoat.
I love the internet.
I'm glad you survived, mate. I once had a friend who died of coffee. Was because of something else in the coffee though, I can't really remember what it was.
looooool!
omg i'm in pieces!
are these fake?
2:01 Yeaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..............
their owners must had been banging so hard every night....
Yeeah
The first one is a muslim goat. He yells for Allah..
1:26 You know you're angry when you start shouting at the goat.
no top comment about the last one?
The one at 1:15 sounds like hes on a roller coaster!! Lmaoo
I wonder if Sarah Jessica Parker can communicate with these creatures.
:25, I died! That was like a horror movie scream. Hilarious!
What if these are downs syndrome goats? :(
2:01 sounds like Patrick Star from Spongebob XD
1:31 ftw :D
the last one freaked me out xD
1:15 Woooooooo
1:24 dont disrespect the goat
I love how they're all like "AAA!" then the last one goes "YEEEEAH!" XD
longer clip of goat @ 0:22?
Αυτά παθαίνεις με τριάρες από κάτι λεβάντε...
1:39 the best.
Im on that side of youtube again lol
Are you saying Goats understand the concept behind cameras and, moreover, that they are camera shy?
1:40 Statler and Waldorf: Goat Edition
They forgot how to goat
Leave the goats alone :"-(
WTF am I watching??
If I didn't know about this and heard it, I swear I'd think somebody was dying in agony!
1.40 angry ass goats xD
haha that spits in his face that was so funny
Daaaaan
That last goat was probably saying yes to the guy/woman who was staring at him with camera . Goat: YEAAHH???
YEAAh
That's one pissed of goat at 1:25! Would not want to cross paths with that at night! Respect to the angry spitting goat!
Maybe we scream like them.
1:59 "YEAAAAAH"
bahahaha the funnies thing i have heard in a long time!!!!!
1:34 "Huuuuuh?!"
This is quite funny with a metal instrumental in the background
1:43 lol! The best part.
is this a new trend?
Omg 1:23 omgg :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD lmao !!! This made my day !
:47 Pee Wee Herman........
609 people are deaf...
AHHHH!
0:30 hahah
i think this would be backing vocal~
lol

It's Spanish. And, by the way, the "dialogue" is very funny:

-Man: "What do you think about Zapatero (the Spanish Prime Minister) government?"

-(goat spits)

-Man: "That's just what I think."
I own goats. They do sound like that.
It's not fake.

there's a reason them goats and sheeps can scream like humans...and it has everything to do with their human handlers getting lonely herding them all the time.

Alot of it seems faked

Thats because its a sheep.
3rd to last, omg. that one was great  XD

1:24 *SPIT* WHAT U SAY BITCH? YEA? SAY IT TO MY FACE THEN! ALRIGHT THEN.

...WHAT?!
Last one was the best!

0:47 is me when I'm stranded on the toilet with no TP.
Apparently you don't know the meaning of the word literally.
I think they flunked their goat sound classes :/
MMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!    MMMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!  MUMMMMMMMM!!!!
Are you a ghost?
The sheep are the funniest part of the video!
AHHHHHHH LMAO
1:23 Fucking Awesome!!!
wtff..... o.o omg....... HAHAAHAHAAHHHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAA xDDDD
Figuratively*
Don't say that. It never is or should be.
Like I want to believe it, but I can't tell if it's fake or not. And I've never been around goats, so....
Funny as hell anyways
fake
:D
So hilarious
1:24. Such an angry goat xD
I am laughing my face off. So funny.
I found my new "bust out laughing cheer me up on a bad day video".  Thank you screaming goats.  You complete me.  Especially you goat at 1:23,  good work.
2:00 Yeeah! :D
the goat at 1:20 is so creepy
I find this video highly disturbing.
Are you saying that the religious people sound like the goat or the atheists do? I like to play devil's advocate, and I've definitely found that religious people have much less intelligent arguments than atheist people, even though I believe in God.
1:23 This is what arguing religion to an atheist feels like.
Literally DIED of laughter! The second goat is a classic.
:25
You do realize that not all these are goats, right?
end one is not real
1:25 LMAO
0:48-0:54
MOMMMMM!!!! MOMMMM!!!

I seriously just laughed out loud!
Fake
Lmfao say this last week and its still funny as hell
Are they real?
Protip: Do not watch this at the library.
Those two black goats at 1.20 scream like they're just gonna break into some martial arts moves!
Holy crap, that is freakin nuts!
Homer Simpson @ 00:24

1:31 "Will you shut the fuck up!?"
1:32 "Fucking idiot..."
1:34 "Did you just try to fucking touch me!?"
some are fake, you can clearly hear that the volume gets cutoff and a new sound comes in.
Omg, this was so awesome! I mean this is just comedy right here...
0:44 - 0:53 sounds like Pee Wee Herman.
1:38 
"Meeeeh?"
"AAAAAAAAH IT'S A MOTHERFUCKING SHEEP"
Do people not know the difference between goats & sheep?  Still funny though.
that's what most of people always do, dude XD that's not something new XDDDD
1:00 ...fuck ooooooooofff
Last one is the best. The dog looks like "What the hell?! Did you hear that too?"
It caught me off guard too. I had to walk out of the coffee shop I was in because people were starting to stare.

No but you must be when you spell productions with a "z" :-) 
Only kids think humour and age have a connection. Im still more intellectual than you i bet ;-)
and you are just stupid who can't laught with anything!!
It's called a sense of humour. You should try it.
and yet your here
oh my god actually crying.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAHA
Wow 31,745 people need to get out more often. These are just goats making noise. Society is in big big trouble.
to compair this with the harlem shake makes me worry for your future
Imagine a sitcom with that spanish/latino guy and the goat living as roommates.

"Goat, stop eating my plants!"
-"Baah? Baah baaaaaah!"

"Goat, why is there poop on the kitchen floor?"
-"Baah baaaah baaah! Baah!"
笑慘了哈哈
Unfortunately, the last one (goat yelling "yeah") is a fake ;)
1:40 Whazaaaa?
anyways its way better than breeding that produces a PIG like YOU.. PIG
Hmmmm, sounds like Washington DC.
Humans yelling like goats next?
maybe they're trying to tell us "please don't eat us"
and he's so STILL

ＨＡＨＡＡＨＡＡＨＡＨＡＡＡＨＡＨＡ　！！
THIS IS FUCKING HILARIOUS
LOL XDDD
this is the only animal that creeps me out hahaha
why even take the time to post on this video then? It's kind of bizarre that you act all holier than thou while also granting views to the thing you supposedly despise. Just because the humour doesn't suit your taste doesn't mean it doesn't have value, you sound like a condescending jackass.
actually, I think the main proof people are retarded is that they think that just because people enjoy watching anomalies in nature makes them mouth breathing idiots, and that they enjoy unrelated and demeaning forms of entertainment. Also that some people think telling others to thumbs them down will make them seem smarter.
also, 1:23 is just like having an argument over the internet :]
OMG! I just fell out of my chair!  LOL
Is this real?
Reincarnation's a bitch.
You're delusional. Just letting you know.
what tea
jajajajajaXD
rofl look @ 1:44 LMFAO To Funny get spit on
Comment.
LMBAO! U make a valid point my friend. If this isn't the dumbing down of society then Idk what is. Ignore the brainwashed sheep they are happy to see some of their own going viral, they will ridicule and mock anyone that speaks outside their grasp of understanding, most are lost causes anyway.
I just actually rofl'd. Actually. xD
srry,i meant to say my teacher showed my class this.Some dude fell out of his chair laughing
My tea
How about you f**k off with your surveys and Nike shoes!
Awwwww Someone's jelly :3
1:46 - 1:58 to je to!
am I wrong o you just got mad bc of this little video. It was actually funny. Nothing wrong in having a little bit laugh now and then. 
You just came and started insulting and making ridiculous asumptionsand deductions. Go and take care of your "business". There are more important issues than that so why you bother.
1:24 Holy crap, this is killing me!
Oh my Goat ...

Goat in the middle: ......AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
1:19 the best xD
0.22 omg xD
So my mother-in-law is actually a goat???
ROFLMAO
You act all superior on the Internet because you're pathetic on the "outside". 

If you said that to me or anyone else "In Real Life" i would ignore you or even punch you because you're a smartass prick.

Now, go study for your big exam which will lead you, in the Future, to work at a place where you'll be "The Bitch" of your Boss and, probably, of your entire office (if you have one) which will then, someday, make you commit suicide for your lack of courage and respect for others.

Goodbye.
Ziegen sind so witzig XD = Goats are so funny XD
One of the funniest videos ever HAHAHA
This is so freaking awesome

Goats are hilarious. If you're ever around them, they're extremely funny to watch and listen to. And on a side note, some of those were sheep... it's too bad that most people don't know the difference.
I was JUST about to ask if anybody had any stories like yours to share... this made my day. sorry about yours, though LOL
Oh my god I can't stop laughing!!

Fake or not, they were all hilarious

My favorite is @1:25
The Silence of the Goats.

LOL 1:23-1:35
Press "7" ...SASSIEST GOAT ON EARTH!
1:37 is the best one hahaha
my god thats creepy as hell
Don't know if this is fake but fake or not its hilarious
Fuck that Spam #7
This video is a sure cure for what ails you. Had a massive fight with my boyfriend, family member is really sick, just stubbed all my toes at once, but god damn I forgot about it all for these blessed few minutes! <3
surely 0:20 has to be fake?
0:22 redneck yelled
Love the one at 0:22! Makes me laugh a lot.
I can't tell if this is fake or not.
everytime i watch this video someone comments saying "i lost my shit" ... lol
The Goat at 1:23 / 2:05 cracks me up every time. :'D
This is so weird, why am I even watching it, because I'm weird...
:25 seconds I lost my shit. My abs hurt from laughing
@Sammiloureeves but it isn't...coming from someone who has owned a goat
jajaja hablan muy bien!
Its still funny, but its fake.
2....8....2....8....2....8
the last one = "yeaaaaah"
90s grunge bands in a nutshell
my jizzing noises bahahahaha
well i got my ab workout in for today. AAAAAAAAAH. heh. but srsly can't stop laughing please send help.
0:23 Lmao
This is why I don't eat goat.
All of these cant be real ... they just sound like human screams dubbed in.  If they are real that's crazy !
00:24
the minute i heard that, i turned into a potato and rolled into the sun
At the end WTF?
LOOOOOL! Funniest video on here! Hahahahahahahahahahahhahaaha xDDDDDDDD
Best part at 1:23 i died.
I like when the goat said baaaaah.
I almost peed my pants watching!!!
This is so funny
Goat you are too drunk
Is this rea
02:00 Say's Dr Dre
0:58 omg sdghjvsssgjn xD
1:23 really hilarious lol
oh look, it's rihanna
I watch this whenever I'm sad and all of my problems go away.
I bet my roommates thought I was crazy when 0:23 rolled around
The first one sounds like Micheal Jackson screaming xD
The utterances of these goats are highly intelligent compared to some of the water cooler gossiping at my workplace.
:D
Hilarious :)
Like a people
The Indoor Kids brought me here!
2:01
LMAO.. grown ass man yelling "mom" at :54
... Yaaaa
That was funny !!
Spam "2" on your keyboard...
Where the hell is Bob already?
Some of these are definitely sheep...
This is the best video I've ever seen.
This is only the beginning of goats taking over the world
these goats seem to have forgotten how to goat
What if humans are the ones yelling like goats?
#DearSomeOne ... 1:24
1:24 هههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه 😂🔫
Jeez the first one is like the audio of goat porn
1:14 and 1:24 are HILARIOUS!!!
2:03 the dog is thinking to himself wtf
Well he did tell the goat to suck his dick... 1:23
Love the end one. YEEEEEEAH.
Kind of horrifying... they seem to be humans trap in the bodies of goats
your comment is as funny as the goats!
0:22 is the best.
I WILL FORCE MY LAZER GOLDFISH TO GET IT BACK SO GIVE IT OR DIEEEEEEEE
Some of these sound utterly fake.
0:44 He lost his ma, apparently
I don't want to get caught looking at this at work. Porn would be easier to explain.
holy moly.. i always heard goats were dumb but..
at 0:30 i tought there was a gap in the goat, until i realised it was a big black spot lol
1:23 xDDD
One more replay wouldn't hurt(;
The second one minds me about when i see my dad in the shower...
0:29 is my favorite.
Meanwhile in Russia...
good shit
What's really annoying is how self-righteous you are about it.
I've been laughing all week at this. God bless YouTube....... and Goats.
wait. i know u!! -o- u just commented after me on smosh pit! ._.V what a small world.
I should probably do my homework.
Last dude was like (Barry white) "YEAAAHH"
Actually, they're screaming with excitement... life is just a big roller coaster to goats!
1:23 Satan?
I believe stupid people are evolving into goats.
0:24 hahahahahahaha
why arent people more sensitive to animals? from the responses this video got, it's clear why the world's flora and fauna are in so much trouble. No-one here even senses that goats, as well as every other animal on this planet, are living beings. Other beings have feelings too, and can sense love as well as give love. the goats in this video were obviously frightened and under stress. Stupid human beings can't even see that.
true :)
ROFL
its like there almost as smart as parrots
Bob left so many goats brokenhearted.
hey :D goats are actually cute but stupid people are not....so I dont think youre right! :D
The last one. Oh my Goat. I almost passed out from laughing so hard.
-What do you think of Zapatero's government?
-BBfffff
-Same here, and what do you think of the canarian government?
-Ggggaawww, ggaaaawww
-And what about the island's municipalities?..
oh my god goats are evolving into chris tucker
Fake, I can hear the pixels...
can anyone translate what the guy is arguing about in 1:23
Tumblr brought me here
THIS IS EPIC

2:01 The dogs reaction is priceless.
YEEA.
Just a bunch of crazy kids
0:24 Best Haha
Lol the baby one was cute
LOLOLOLOL 1:00
We are more related to goats and sheep than we thought... I wonder when we'll find one speaking.
AFK brought me here.
1:44 Sounds like Steve Carell!
2:01 YEAHHHH
That yell at 0:22 is clearly fake... and some other ones...in fact a lot of them are fake
yeah, they are two different animals and I was just trying to inform the general public that is not surrounded by agirculture on a daily basis.
0:24 so fake
Not ba-ad! (Susbscribe to DemoCastMedia Channel).
this is the funniest stuff I have seen for a long while hahaha
Humans yelling like goats

/watch?v=lB_w0wegltM
She knows too much! Release them!
reminds me alot of belsimpel commercials
does it really matter?
1:23, that's some quality footage
this made me laugh so hard i was crying :22 was the best one haha!
Goat 4 sale!
I believe goats are evolving into stupid people.
1:23 lol
"YeeaaAHHh"
literally died watching this! hahahahahahha
And you can tell this is real because of the voice popping when the tone goes down. Thought this was another fake video at first.
MOM!!!! MOMMMM!!!! MOMMM!!!!
What is that? Is that a deer? Oh you. You so random! ;) @ 1:02
0:24 and 1:16 HOLY DUPER GIGA ULTRA OMEGA FUCK !!!! those yelling are real ????? WTF

2:01 yeeeeeeeeeaah
OMFG IM SOBBING

WTF Are you watching Al??
351 peopl-BAAAAAAAAHHGGGHH
Hahahahhahahahahhah! LOL. the sad part is, is i searched this up myself. dont ask.
Creepy but super funny LOL
They saved the best for last - when the German Shepherd hears the goat and makes an expression like "WTF?"
Damn shape-shifters screaming for help, don't know why we keep them alive.
"Help me I've been turned into a goat!"
fucking answer them, Bob.
The last one @2:00 :3 (funny despite sounding very fake-ish)
Damn that's funny
That was the best 2 minutes of my life...
00:44 "MOMMMM! MAAAA! .....MOMMMMMM!"
There's some sheep in there... and yes there is a difference between goats and sheep :)
1:41   "bah" "bah" "AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH" just amazing haha
Those aren't all goats. It's annoying that people overlook that. It's also annoying that people don't know the difference.
hahahaah freaky
Rape face at 2:03

Fake but funny
1:24 AHAHAHAHAH

2:00
YEAAHH!
Hallarious! The funniest animal video ever
Thumbs up if you laughed soooo hard!
I think this video and "What I Did All Weekend" are my two favorite on youtube
a couple of them were really fake. It was obviously dubbed over by a person screaming in a room (even though the footage is outdoors) it's pretty obvious.
u really made me laugh, this is so true :)
1:37 ="=
it actually IS for real....
The funniest ever on youtube - and the best is - IT´S  NOT FAKE
my wife keeps telling me she wants a baby goat.  OMFG can you imagine hearing this at sunrise every day?
Laughed too hard, I no longer have any sides.
omg at 1:23 I couldn't breathe!!!!
1:25!!! Lmao
Haha I want a goat now
ha ha goats are so weird.
Sitting here home alone, laughing like a fucking lunatic at this video. Oh my werd. :']

Très bonne thérapie du rire

1:26 my new favorite moment in history
Help! Help! The fuckers have tied me up! Help! Help!

MARCO! POLO! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
1080p Yelling Goats.
Hahaha!
WTF was that last one?!
I'm going to make this my alarm.
The goat at 1:43 sounds like my drunk Uncle Mannie.
The fake ones kinda ruin it...
Then i switched to porn because it was easier to eplain
Those that are screaming are SHEEP.
Omg they're so cute lmao
0:43

BOB!!!!!!! BOB!!!!!!!!
крут
Like if George Takei brought you here.
Lol, 0:22 is definately the best and caught me ofguard. Very funny.

The one at the end is prolly the hardest to believe its real :P
thankyou for putting this together.
Crying tears of laughter...
0:43, the original and the best
1:16 woah spit came out. 2:02 Yeah.
1:25 to 1:36 I can't stop laughing
some of these are obvious fakes but the rest are amazing and hilarious!
I was pissing myself until the end....then i shit myself !!!
Timmah!
This is what the internet was created for!
Oh my god, i think im gonna die, HAHAHAH! thats so funny, i love this!

Awesome, sign them up for voice over work on horror movies!!!
2:01 , Dog like WTF!!
0:44 Usher!

"well I'll be, Greatest Of All Time" was his reaction.
Goats are awesome!!
I've never laughed so hard.  Omg!!!!!!
John Baahner at his best...
0:50 FUUUUUCK! FUUUCK!
So funny :,)
BAAAAAAAAAA
1:25 I'm sorry if I'm offending anyone, but I wouldn't smacked that goat in the face after that.
Fake.
Last was the best
freaky

1:23-1:37 เหมือนคุยกันรู้เรื่องนะ 555+
I'M CRYING HAHA OMG
Thanks for that, I needed a good laugh. That German Shepherd at the end is priceless!
Omg that last one! O-0
The second one is fake. You can hear the background noise fade out when the goat is yelling. The last one is also fake. The rest I think are real. Hilarious nonetheless.
@00:46 Bob! Bobbbb!
This makes me happy.
they did not say like humans
Are any human sounds dubbed in this?????    Really wonder....but it sure is hilarious!!!!
1:23-1:37 I can't stop crying lol
There are six sheep in here!  Including the thumbnail!!
1:37
FAKE AND GAY
Daniel Bryan
i want to hear one that sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger..."Aughaugha ugh augh!!"
GIVE ME MY JELLYFEESH BACH
Eeeeeeeeed! Heeeeeeeelp!
@2:00

This is just goddamn horrendous.  I am disturbed to the core.  Liked.
Are we really to believe that last one?
Funny.
330 people laughed so hard that they clicked the dislike button by mistake.
freakin' goats xD
Reminds me of congress.
I died XD
They're learning our ways! Its not long until they know how to speak
0:24 LOL!!!!
Well. I can see you're very affectionate of goats, that's something I admire. You know, I certainly will do my research and quite possibly invest in now. Thanks, man, I do believe you may have improved my life just a little. You have a great life yourself, I suppose, so yeah. Ricardo, here I come :)
I can't eat goats anymore after watching this
1:23 is gunna be from now on how I deal with people that are bothering me
The third goat gets me every time.
"MOOOOM!"
"MOOOOOOOMMM!!!"
Iast one is fake as Gil

That one at :24. I almost peed myself....
goats are sooo cute :D
No..CNN
Fake or not i freaking LOVE this!
Same. I'm dying going, "why am I laughing tho?!" this is the best video on the internet.
I was preparing for a high pitched voice on the last one, I shit in my pants.
Help!Heeelp
todas unas loquillas!
1:15 my favorite
I think they're all fake. "Super cut videos"
The last one is fake
1:25   Best. Argument. Ever.
yeaaaaa... 2:00
LOL 
0:43 MOM!!! MOM!!! MOM!!
They were yelling because they found out that they became the acronym for 
whiteboy7thst's "Subscribers"
This is how God punishes all the people who bought Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift records. He turns them into goats.
I am crying right now laughing so hard. I dont even know why I'm actually laughing. At this point, I think they should come get me
- Uniiiiiii
- Meeeeeeeeeeeeehhh
I need a goat
Proof that reincarnation is real...and that it hurts.
yeeeaaah
I eat all of them.
Maybe it's humans who yell like goats.
1:37 UAHAUAHAUAHAUHAUAHAUAHAUAHAUAHAUAHAUA LOL
1:22 is perfect
There's like four fake ones in there, fucking fail.
XD I love tho
Lolwat...
The last one just killed me. xD
Bob! (0:50)
Goats? I thought this was Fox News!
hahahaha
Sounds like big foot
Sounds like Arabs
They speak with the tongue of man!
1:37       i can watch that shit a thousand times and still laugh
OH JESUS CHRIST THE SECOND ONE I'M DYING
Can never takes Silence of the Lambs seriously any more...
the one right before the last 1 was the best!
0:24 and 1:40 really broke my ability to breathe there for a bit...
hahahahaha
So funny! This cannot be real! :) 
Love it!
Where the fuck is Bob?
I lost my shit at 0:24
I hope so.. How I wish laughing could cure cancer.
Evolution. Animals are learning how to speak. Which is awkward to say the least, especially when a human tries to slaughter goats that are cursing him in a language he understands.
damnn it's hilarioussss haha, and omg they are soooo cuteee <3
What if these are humans that have been turned into goats, and they're trying to tell us?
1:24 - that goat waited to spit in his face instead of on the back of his head. like a boss.
312 humans yell like goats.
The second goat owes me a keyboard and a new drink.
I have not had such a good healthy laugh in so long. Thank you
Da fuq did I just watch
This is good news thank you. Your homework is to destroy Fox News and continue to vote for the Democrats. Thanks for your time redofspades and have a good life
Jajajaja Lol I loved it but I am sad because they are yelling like if they were suffering
Gets my vote for funniest video on youtube right now. It's been a while since I've been in tears.
The goat at the end sounds like Sponge Bob's friend Patrick.
02:00 could become a meme I'd say.

"JEAH"
Yeaaa I lold
I could watch 1.25 all day on repeat.  Most awesome scene ever.
1:23 - 1:36 is just so unbelievably great
Not...that...sure...might..be...funniest...thing...ever...
greatest compilation in internet
Reminds me of Regular Show...
I have cancer.... But you're right :)
I can tell you haven't been to America either, he is foreign by the way, he is from Denmark. You're British and you accuse Americans of being nationalistic, you're a hypocrit, no one has conquered other lands than Britain. Most Americans aren't nationalistic at all, vast majority don't care about the country but only themselves and family, infact many citizens hate America because of its politics, economy, division between people, and multiculturalism to be brutally honest.
The second, third, sixth, and last goat sounded fake. If only they knew Bob...
Yeah, but how about them goats!
Stop spreading your silly lies. This cures HIV.
Bob is our souls, the very fabric of our being. Bob is who we truly are, we may not know it but inside we are all Bob. Bob is the person who keeps you going through thick and thin. Bob is what holds us together, with everyone else in the universe. Bob is us.
Goats learned yelling like us after all the human sacrifices they've done.
What the hell does this have to do with goats?
the 2nd one sounds like ned flanders
I love it when Family Guy does that whole thing. I can tell you're a good American now, thank you for replying. Please spread your goodness to other Americans like redofspades and make your country appear less Romney to the outside world.
Thank you so much!!!!! Awesome!
By stating that he hasn't been to America you agree that he must be foreign because most American's- I imagine about 52% by your count- are so nationalistic that they can't take a joke about the USA. You say 48% aren't 'even' white- I suggest you read that back to yourself and reconsider your phrasing.
1:39
0:25  самый ржак))))
Lolololololol
OMG, the last one, YEEAHHHH! HAHAHHAHAAH
"No you shut up!!!" "No you shut up!!!"
What's your opinion? 48% of people in America aren't even white and most whites in America are a mix of German, Italian, and Irish, so what is American?
1:23
Goats: "I'm bored to death"
Literally thinks all Americans speak with the same dialect
a jeśli to z bólu...?
The last one is a fake :/
they learned to scream like that because of lonely danish farmers ;)
this cures cancer
Miss Proasheck brought me here
I almost had a heart attack on 1:23
Joke right, sure. And are you joking too or just being an asshole in spite? I rest my case. Nobody likes someone who thinks and acts like they are better than somebody else based simply off of where they come from. Should I ask you if you have all your teeth being from the UK and all? Oh, only joking of course. So that should make it all right right?
muuuuuuum! muuuuum! muuuuuum! MUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM! LOL some of the goats sounded like it was saying that
The last one sounds like Patrick from Spongebob. lol
if you get lost in the woods and you lost your voice screaming for help.......find a goat and make it yell :D
the 3rd one is high as fuck :D
He must be foreign if he's making comments like that eh?
You only make yourself look American with your complete lack of the ability to take a joke.
You only make yourself look bad with that kind of stereotypical-thinking and bigotry.
Funny as hell :)
Aaaand straight to favourites
1:59 YEAAAAAA
There is no American dialect or American people anymore you idiot, it's just a conglomerate of different people now, you just haven't been here.
Bullshit, funny though.
yeeeeaah
Wow funny I guess :/
@Thundersplorer WTF U tryed to masturbate at gotes
This must have been where the Doritos's goat came from....
1:16 sounds like homer simpson's scream ahaha
1:23 MY SIDES
funny but this is a little bit creepy
i think its broken.
And thats how the American dialect came to be.
lol, totally homer simpson
LOOOOOL so funny!
The scream @0:23 sounds suspicious. 
There's a weird auto cutoff right after, leading me to believe that it was dubbed over by an actual human.
STOP IT, RON, STAUHHHP.
Well, now cats have a competitor on Youtube.
I love the dog in the last one. He's like WTF!
Also 1:20 sounds like homer simpson screaming.
most of these goats sound like grandpa simpson.
It's possible, you just got to try really hard.
Now the owner's of those goats should breed them together and use natural selection to create a new race of hyper-intelligent/hyper-human-sounding demon's. Then send them back in time to mess with early humans.
/watch?v=B9Hc204XVNA :D
2:00 yeeeeeeeah
Jacksgap brought me here
Ahahhahahahahahahahahah the 2nd one
i died when the 2nd goat screamed.
Last goat:  "Yeah..."
why not Donald ? a goat is an awesome pet... smarter than a dog...but you have to be careful...they are very clever at getting out of their pens..I had a pen that was 6 feet tall and one of my goats was able to easily jump out of it !! I had to put a top on the pen! they are so much fun though... they follow you and can be very playful
When a goat yell it is like a man yell. Yagshimesh!
Goats Yelling Like Retards
What kind of dog is in the last clip?
Nope. That's the sound mixer adjusting the amplitude. If you make it about 12 times louder at the "splitting" part, you'll hear the background again. I made the same mistake once.
Zoey brought me here.
Zoeya?
1:37 has me absolutely in tears with laughter XD
The last one is fake.Funniest one is the one which sounds like someone being murdered.
Lmao
My internal organs still bleed...
the one at 0:22 is overdubbed.  You can hear where they've spliced the audio.
These are not goats! These are people who have been turned into goats by that evil blair witch woman.  These may even be those kids that got lost in the woods back in the mid ninties when all that took place.  Bless their goat hearts, we can't do anything for them.  We can't turn them back into human beings, they just need to live out their goat lives and be has happy as possible!
I found this surprisingly difficult to masturbate to.
0:46 potato camera!
:24 seconds, DIED ROFL
1:23 LOL, that thing is hilariously offended by that man.
This video gets me everytime! XD lmao!
I'm on that part of youtube again..
Bahahaha!!! Valid point.
Monkeys look like humans and goats scream like humans omfg lol
that 2nd on, lmao!
Did you expect an insightful top comments that would change your world view when you clicked on this goat video? It's just a logical reply to the former top comment.
bahahahah

AHHHHHHHH!
it has started  the end is near
Still better than listening to One Direction
XDDD
Go Ats, are so darn funny
Brought here by a zombie video wtf ??? XD
omg @1.23
my right index finger brought me here.
Brought here by reddit.
who cares
died at the ones sounding like girls
0:22 sounds like Homer Simpson when he realizes he is out of beer.
this is why people used to think Goats where the Devil :I
Better than listening to peacocks..
1:24

Not only does the goat spit, but it screams in the guy's face. That's awesome.
Now I know why Agent Starling was so desperate for the silence of the lambs.
the biggest mistake of all my life to watch this video when high
Gosh that would have been glorious.
I would be yelling if they were gonna sluaghter me too.
That last one is fake.
Press '8', and again just before it hits 1:43.  Somebody could easily make that into a sick beat.
I forgot how to goat.
Truly these are the end times.
Then you've seen some weird shit to get here.
The last one was fake
1:54 TIMMEH!
nobody brought me here
Ok, I have to ask. Is this real or edited?? Can goats really sound like this?
Good lord....surely one of the signs of the apocalypse! LMFAO!!
WTF
brought myself here
I brought myself here at gunpoint.
towell chat
lmao
I was seriously expecting one of these goats to do the Wilhelm scream.
1:41
goats: bahhhhh
other goat: -looks around- 
AHHHHHHHHH
He's asking the goat what it thinks about the government (Spanish government to be exact)
a youtuber.
what if goats where humans?! what if they were just secret agents covered in hair and were sent to gather information to send to the government!?
For some reason, it sounds like a black guy yelling!
Same!
The one at 1:45 sounds like he is responding to someone yelling. Like "AAAAH!" and he responds with "DEEEEEEH!"
i feel sorry for them
1:17 I didnt see that coming.
Sheep and goats are funny!  Doesn't everyone know that?
0:23 IS THE BEST! CRYING!!! ;D
A bunch of these goats are actually sheep
I was waiting for a cute adorable goat with a deep voice
I was not dissapointed xD
Love that part.  It's like the guy is trying to argue with it.  Hope for his sake that was staged...
The fact that this has 3 million views is what is funny. Idiocracy, here we come.
1:33 The FUCK did you just say?
Search "Don't argue with an ibex".
who the fuck is zoey proasheck
Holy crap, I was NOT expecting that last one to have such a low voice. Also, I love the one at 1:23. Sounds/looks like they're having a fight.
I'm cryiiiiiiinnngggggg oh my gaaaaaaaawd~
Goats are terrifying.
George Takei brought me here.
Is there a full video of the one that shouts and spits at the reporter cus that is just amazing. Genuinely looks like the goat is trolling him on purpose!
287 people have 0 sense of humor.
The second one is fake.
BIIILLLLLLLL
The one at 0:24 KILLS me! HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
Now I want a pet goat.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Someone needs to stop moving the floor on that goat at 1:43
Love the goat at the end
Can I has a goat? Unlike ThatFreak, I'll love it, and I'll name it Ricardo.
It's like there's a human stuck inside each one of those goats and they're crying for help. But it's too funny for them to be taken seriously.
Go home drunk, you're goat
They all sound like Pee Wee Herman.
is anyone here a vet
1:59.... -Thinking...: Okay.. big finale... "YEEAAH" -Dog is terrified-
Thumbs up if you came from reddit lol
Zoey you silly girl.

1:59 the dogs face is amazing, lmao
MOOOOM! MAAA!
Me watching Twilight.
why am i watching goats?
0:22, I can't stop laughing
XD
Borderline demonic?..
Sounds like after a long night at the bar.
I forgot how to goat!
why would you throw something at an animal? I've had goats ...and I've brought them to fairs... I guess it's because of people like you that I never let them stay over night there, but brought them only on the days that their classes were held. They bleat because they are telling you of their needs... they are either hungry, thirsty, or they want to be somewhere other than where they are... not because they are antagonized ... which again brings me to... why would you anyway?
Were or are these humans reincarnated as goats? ;)
This video helped me find enlightenment
The equivalent of an Obama speech, lol.
Ohh.. MAKE IT STOP XD :'D
... Can't stop laughing at 1:26 ...
Lol the third was a human scream
Is this real!? hahaa
LMFAO!! I WAS JUST DYING HERE!! CANT STOP LAUGHING!!!!!!!!!!!!! WAHAAAAAAAAAHAHAHA!!!
I wonder if Jay Park was really bored that he ended up watching this kinds of videos LMAO
I started to laugh so hard at that one ! x'D seriously I was tearing up LMAO
O-0 what just happened
Press 2, lol
oouhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1:40 shut up!
2:01 : Yeeeah...

Hahaha this is hilarious OMG
Oh god please tell me 0:23 is real. That made me nearly piss my pants.
i'm fucking crying oh my god
to the same thing that has always been.
The first youtube video it's a man in a zoo talking about how big the elephant dick is.
Wow I did not know that also applied to goats! That's insane! Thanks for letting me know :) ps good up the good work on the violin
as long as it's a good tool like a screwdriver, that's ok.
Your still a tool though ;)
some parts are so fake, but everything is so lovely! : )
thanks zoey.
That's not italian, he's talking about Zapatero so he's spanish, dumbass
Nobody gives a shit
GOAT SPIT ON ME ?
I SPIT BACK ON HIM !!!
I'm not taking that shit from a fucking goat - or anything else >:|
go home goat, you're drunk
1:41 fucking lol'd
She said "i thought someone was screaming for help but it was just the goat" which means she thought a HUMAN was screaming for help but it was just the goat yelling. The goat wasn't screaming for help...
The last one, I couldn't breathe xD
Jay Park brought me here <3
0:22 is dubbed, as is a few others.
The last one is my favorite. Also, Zoey Proasheck sent me here.
0:22 is the best
Whenever my parents call me i say 2:01
Questo non è niente al confronto con il cane parlante, l'orso che chiama la mamma e l'alce che chiama la mamma.
The last one is the best , also Zoey brought me here
hahahahaha fuukkk the first one though
<--------------
Last one is the best
1:15 xD
Go home goat , you're drunk
MUUUUUMMM!! THE MEAT LOAF
last one the best hehehehe
I don't understand what would cause this..
lol, learn to understand what is a joke and what isn't.
Read that back to yourself and realise how much of a tool you are. :)
LOL, check out my channel too!!!!
Jay park sent me too lol
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋhahahaha it good
how do you know that spitting in your face isn't the height of etiquette for a goat, you don't know their culture! We could be the ones who are rude for wiping it off and that's why they get annoyed.
Fucking brilliant
LOL!
I disagree, the scream at 1:17 is shorter I think. Who cares anyway, it's still hilarious.
this is the creepiest thing on earth
Jesus Christ.
that is so funny.  i loved it.  cant tell if it was the goats or a person.  i rate this video.as a A++++.
I can always trust Yogscast Zoey to bring me somewhere good :D
Daaaa fuuuuuup?
1:52 you can hear a raving rabbid in the background
The goat was screaming for help and you did nothing...??? says a lot about who YOU are as a person...
1:46 sounds like my old 2 stroke dirtbike.
My neighbor has a goat and one time late at night i thought someone was screaming for help but it was just the goat XDD
Lol
1:40 Goats hate sheep.
Chav Goat will spit in yo face xD
Is the second one fake? O.o
the last one is probably fake
They aren't fucking sheep
I kinda feel like these sheep have an actual problem,like some kind of illness and i don't know if i should feel bad for them xD
The last one.
oh my fucking god. So funny.
The German shephard int he background is like "are you listening to this arsehole, man?"
0:24 ringtone pls
/watch?v=NqDaMSk00wA
As to the why? I have no idea.
I'm sorry, but I think I just pissed my pants a little at 0:26
zoey?
Amazing
1:23 LOL
After watching this vid I can confirm I can't breathe & I have tears rolling down my face!
2:00 DAT GERMAN SHEPARD ♥

I've never laughed this hard and cried this much in my life.
The ones at 0:22 and 1:17 are fake, if you listen closely they make the exact same noise
0:30
1:44 sounds like Ed from Ed Edd n Eddy
1:25 "hey, I'm-a walkin here"

1:44 i want that goat lol :D
2:00 xDDD
1:23 is the most hilariously belligerent animal I've ever seen. :P

Haha the guy arguing with the goat needs subtitling
00:22 and 1:17 so weird! And the guy arguing with the goat...very weird!
The second one cracks me up every time!
The one with the goat arguing with the Italian guy destroyed me.
This is the best thing ever
THE GOAT ARMY IS RISING!!!!!!
:23 is a sheep and so is 1:13 and 1:40 is a pair of sheep. The very last little critter is a black lamb. Is it really so difficult to tell them apart?
lol the ending YEAAAAHHHHH! i know somebody who sounds like that ima show him.
These are the sounds of F.S. victims.
Knew Babe was fucking real!
Every time my neighbor goes around his goats the little ones start yelling Dahahahahaddyhyhyhyhyhy!
Goats are fucking creepy.
I cried I laughed so hard
I agree with you... but grammatically speaking, most funny is not correct, it's funniest.
It's Shauna sheep It's Shauna sheep.
But... you never know, though.
Its so funny but i get kinda sad when they sound like they yell "mooooommm!!"
So... you a republican?
Or maybe ma.
Is this a legit noise that they make???
Humans Yelling Like Goats
I would really hate to hear the noises they are all making when they are banging each other.
1:24.. Holy mother of god. Spits on him and screams at him.
1:19, too funny.
Best/most funny scream is at 1:41
OMG I'M CRYING 1:25 OMG LMFAO
Yeah.....

Goats <3
0:25 kills me

0:15 
WILL FERRELL, IS THAT YOU?
1:22
Man says something that is an insult in the language of goat. 
1:24
Goat spits on man out of anger and yells at him
1:27 
Goat is proud, but man fights back
1:29
Goat: What's wrong with you
1:31
Goat: Just... Just leave me alone!
1:32 
Goat: I hate you.
1:34 
Goat: What?
There's a man stuck in the goat's body!
This is like listening to lil Jon.

Waaaaaahhhh!!!!

XD omg... 2:25 "AAAAAA!!!" o god... that made me start to cry of funnyness
"HEY, THIS LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I SEE IN MY SHELTERED LIFE, THEREFORE IT MUST BE FAKE!!!"
get the fuck over yourself, loser.
Holy shit I almost threw up I was laughing so hard
Nah man, I've seen goats do it at the Fair, you tick one off by throwing stuff at it, it'll scream ay ya
Fake.
niggas be like 1:24 .......
"yeaaaaaahhhhhhhhh" hahahahaha!
I'm in tears
When you slash their throats for slughter they sound like babies screaming.
a few of them are dubbed... and the others... well I guess folks just need to get to a barn more often to hear what animals sound like ......
1:15 needs to be the new "Wilhelm scream".
my pawpaw had some goats and they just made normal noises. LOL
Maybe I'm weird but it's scary for me
its like the wind got knocked out of him 0:31 hahahaha
As a psychic and animal communicator, I have to say I am so happy that these goats are FINALLY being heard. It's not easy living the animal life. These poor guys are constantly being mistaken for sheep. This is a cry for acknowledgement, people. I recently had one of those myself (big surprise since it was Valentine's Day...)
Is this real haha awesome
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA THE GOAT SAID "YEEEAAAAAAAHHH!!!"
why is that funny xD
I think I am on the weird side of youtube again..
0:57
So of these are obviously fake, but for the real ones, well they're just more proof that goats are going to take over the world
I love when they scream. Its like the Dorito commercial. So funny when goats scream high pitched
Jabum Park Bring Me Here lol

Jay Park Sent me here ^^
I don't care if any of these are fake. I'm dying laughing.
Marianas Trench brought me here. lmao
The second, last, and high pitched "AAAAAH!" Ones are fake. I have goats, and sometimes they sound like this:3
I'm really concerned with what Ramsay does on the internet
Crying with laughter
ahha...I can't stop laughing
The last one seems the most legit, everything else was clearly dubbed over.
YYYYYEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
They were asked what they thought of Joe Biden
This reminds me of that part of Disney's Pinocchio when the boys get turned into donkeys.
That the funniest things I've seen on YouTube in a while....yeeaahhh
i lost it at 1:24 oh my god
This scares me
This is how I like to spend my Saturday nights..
2nd one was fake, you could tell cause the audio cut out when it screamed.
Yeeaaaaah
Screamingly funny. Literally. Really well done, nice blend of real goat sounds and the , uhh, not so goat-ish sounds. I look forward to more from you jokers, hope this isn't just a one off.
She's screaming "Let me the hell out of this gate!"
At 0:17 doesn't that sound like Pee Wee Herman? AHH!
you think this is freakin' when they slaughter lambs they cry like kids. That's where the title "Silence of the lambs" comes from.
This is so fucking scary
Iam so wet right now
2:01 "YEEEEEAAAAHHHH"
Wish you hadn't put in the fake ones, they're funny enough as is.

This is funny, but you guys really have to learn to tell the difference between goats and sheep. (Sheep appear at :21, 1:12, 1:37, and 1:59.)
"MOOOOOOOM!" "DAAAAAAAAD!!"

I love it how the guy kept going and played along after the goat spat on him.
lol the dog at the end in the last clip was like,  "...the fuck?"
Better than the hunger games.
Who came here from Yahoo?
the second one sounds like something from a movie, I wonder if they use a goat or a real person for that sound effect now lol
1:37
It was a baby. Could've been there temporarily.
We had to keep a newborn inside for a week or so. c:
haha the last ones face. frickin hilarious!
I had a goat that did that! I didn't think to record it though. D:
Sounds like a bunch of Politicians... or are these democrats in the Senate?
so this is what entertains me on the internet now?
Favorite one from 1:36 to 1:43
Goats: Meeehhhhh
Goat's reply: Aaaaahhhhhhh
LOL
Maybe they're impersonating us the same way we often impersonate them... who knows?
WAAHAAHAAAHAHA
The dubbed ones are SO not funny!
As the goat at 2:00 said...
Oh my god
Some of these goats do need a record contract. Nothing a little autotune can't fix. Just ask Rebecca Black.
Bawls.... I literally just posted the same thing and didn't see your comment.. FAIL on my part.
User, is that you?
"MOM!!!! MOM!!!!!!!!!" MOOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!"
@0:37 I thought that goat had a really weird back, then I realised it was the wall behind that was the same colour..
The year 2013, we still don't have flying cars but at least goats can yell.  We are making progress.
Omg my sides! My sides they hurt so bad!
MOM! MOM, MOOOOM!!! MOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!
Are these what those adorable baby goats that leap about the backyard grow into?!
Thanks for the hernia.
I should be out trying to get laid,
But here I am watching goats yell,
No wonder I never get laid,
ugh.
2:00 YEEEAAAAHHHH

Hahaha too funny
Yea that's the best one.. I peed my pants.
1:25 - Stone Cold Goat Austin
His fake what?
1:24  still better drama than Twilight...
They sound like my neighbours the caprio  family
That awkward moment when your goat yells like a human...
I was dying of laughter while digging out all those comments :)
is that really goat's voice or some men shouting from behind? i doubt
I think 0:23 and 1:14 sounds similar...
00:21 1:13 1:37 1:59 I just can't stop laughing
1:37 beeeeeeeeee AAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Omg
The very last one, is that a goat in the house. House pet?
:/
Hilarious!
haha xD This nearly made me laugh more than the video ^^ Glad SOMEONE is taking these things SERIOUSLY!
WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?
1:24

"This goat was charged with statutory rape"
Goat "Bullshit"
"Its true, she was still a kid(young goat)
Goat "No!"
So your saying you didn't sleep with her?
Goat" Thats not what I meant."
Goat" Man fuck this
See see I was right
Goat: " I already stopped arguing shut up."
1:37 gets me each time! XD I am reminded of the Muppets for some reason.
Sounds like peewee Herman
2:00
Who knew something as simple as a goat yelling like a human could make me laugh do hard.
this just made my day, speaking of, did that goat ever find bob?
1:45 is my favorite :D :D
the fucked up one is a sheep :)
Yeah, goats actually make this sound on occasion.
Been down in the dumps since valentines day.. this cheered me up a bit really appreciate it. Life should be full of laughs every day!
i would def use goats in a horror movie/game/porn :))
I don't know if I should be laughing or be scared. LMAO.
okay, interesing :D ...thanks jack for sending me here ;) :D
check out the best top comments for this video :)
Never thought I would hear my Dad hollowing at the goats again. This is spooky. They are now trying to call him.

0:49 - 0:53 "Heeeeeeeelp"

Thank you, Jackson! :D
0:43 Did that goat ever find Bob?
indeed!
google "mega breaking soul traps"
Jack, what the hell are you watching?
They can scream like each other. Just like dogs of the same breed usually bark a lot like.
1:09 "what can I do for you?"
the dog at the end is all like ''WTF''??
Just like fifth grade when told recess is over!
Wtf
Almost 2million views in just 1 day and a half. Incredible...
''MOOOOM!!!''
Yeeeeeeahhh! 02:00
0:24 ROTFLMFAO
I think 0:20 and 1:12 are fake. The dubbing is not natural. The rest are definitely real.
The last one is Patrick Star in disguise
That last one.
aahahhahaaahhas
"Yeah."
the one at 1:12 is just crazy, I laughed for like 20 mins because of it, I cant even breath its so funny LMFAO.
I need to get me one of those goats, damn that's funny.
0:44 Usher goat
WTF lol
hahahahah jebłam, padłam, KURWA SPADŁA M!
clearly dubbed over
Humans yell?
1:12 killed me.... :DDD
I wonder if some of these sounds were from Dead Space....
@SuperEvilMel totally agree
Hahahaha, my mom was the one who sent me this video xD
Were those true?
lol too funny
fake
1:23:
Shut up.
blalblalblalbla
SHUT UP!
blablablabla
I SAID SHUT UP!
blablabla
up.
Maybe they are yelling to let them free
That was absolutely terrifying!
lol That last one sounds like Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants!
CATHERINE!!!!
lmfao!
The last one "yeeeahhh"
1:23 was funniest :DDDDDDD
Oh it can, a lot of animals if they are around humans enough will start to mimic  their noises.
The last one:
"Yeaaaahhhhhhh"
This is disturbing..... Human souls trapped in goats.
I almost choked to death from laughing to hard!
Hahaha!! :) Love it!
Why would I be? :O
Creepy
For reasons I am not sure I understand myself, this is the funniest thing I have EVER seen. Damn near killed me.
1:20 Is so great
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Dear Bob, please own up! They've been looking for you every where. I mean it, EVERYWHERE!! LOL
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOB WHERE ARE YOU BOB
This is the internet.
1:44 . cant ........ stop ......... lauging ! XD
dat ending
Shut up you stupid hippy
I asked myself the same thing until 0:24 hit. Damn near spit out my drink.
1:36 ROFL :D "määh... ARGH!" :D
anyone know where the original vid is to the spitting goat one thats fucking brilliant XD
THIS CANNOT BE REAL!?
Are these all real?
1:40 is too funny
They would be used for the CSI intro.
"and at the point she said...oh my GOAT" -YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAHHHHHH
Yeah
I find it much more enjoyable when they have human screams before I sacrifice them to my pagan gods
See how fucking annoying most people sound...

'Adults' yelling, smirking, giggling & blathering almost 24/7 worse than children 

Whatever happened to people showing some maturity/evolution, class & character 

Thank-you goats for showing the world
hahahahahaqhahahah
yeeeah
i was eating a double bacon cheeseburger when i read this, not even joking. But guess what, it was still fucking delicious.

The owl was soo cuteee
The problem is that the guinea pig who's been put on his back, and looks like he's asleep actually isn't having fun! He's terrifying and mimicking a death response because it's what a predator does to disable it's pray and what pray do to in a last ditch effort to persuade the predator that they're not worth eating because there already dead. Rabbits also do it, and no they don't enjoy it, they hate it. They look calm because it's the only option left to them in that situation, and doing that can in extreme cases kill them because of the shock it causes.
shout out to people who record cute animal stuff because I look up these types of videos when I have an panic attack :')
I love animals😻🐶🐱🐭🐹🐰🦁🐯🐨🐼🐻🐮🐷🐸🐙🐒🐔🐧🐦🐤🐣🦄🐴🐗🐺🐥🐝🐛🐌🐞🐜🐢🐍🦀🦂🕷🐠🐟🐡🐬🐳🐃🐅🐆🐊🐋🐂🐄🐪🐫🐘🐖🐎🐑🐏🐐🐀🐁🐓🦃🕊🐿🐇🐈🐩🐕💘💞

Hi guys, So I just started a petition on the Whitehouse site which calls upon congress to make factory farming illegal, and I figured that I would come here for fellow animal lovers. For those of you who don't know, factory farming is the practice of keeping a huge amount of farm animals in a very confined space so as to maximize profit with no concern for the animals. The space in a factory farm is so confined, in fact, that the animals have no room even to move. These animals are bred unnaturally, to have certain profit-increasing enhancements which jeopardize the health of the animals. Often, these farms fail to operate within legal limits of animal welfare and continue to do so unhampered. Factory farming is an incredibly common practice.
So, what I ask of you is to go to my petition and sign it. Maybe if enough of us do it, we can make some sort of difference in this horrible practice.
Here's the link: https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/make-factory-farming-illegal-and-hold-farms-higher-standards-animal-welfare
Thanks!

I'm in my 165 yo haunted house alone and I'm freaked out so I'm blasting my fav song, using our oil diffuser, turned on all the lights, and decided to watch cute/funny things:):) #lifegoals

Erm hi, just letting you know animals like rats, hamsters and hedgehog etc cannot swim, they might look cute in water, or you feel better bathing  them in water but actually it's really torturing to them. :)
Everyone likes a good scratching.
I saw the one with the lion on Facebook lol

The Internet killed me on this cute video
Oooooooo q bonito
Animals are ugly and stupid. I once had a turtle when i was around 7 years old, she committed suicide by throwing herself from the 4th floor...although i overloaded her with all kinds of food and candy.
3:10 is that appropriate?
This was the cutest cute animal complication video I've ever seen!
Why does this not have a world record of cuteness yet seriously why not?
Monkey and cat are having sex
At 4:29 its an otter
Dat baby bunny 💖💖💖💖
sooooooooooo.
 cute
1:16 "PUMPKIN"
If it wasn't for the quills they'd be more popular than cats.
Inflection, nuance?
Noam Chomsky, can you interpret for us?
WOW! 
This woman and her good pal are "doin' fine."
Gaia at her best...
You know me, the fighting freak Knuckles,
And we're at Pumpkin Hill,
You ready?
is it wrong that I just laugh at his squeeking through the whole video...
Teddy is cute
I love the way you feel like if you just pay attention a little harder you can understand what he's saying. I love rodents. Most have such a cuteness about them and you can always see their intelligence.
the pumpkins look like plastic o_O
Utterly STINKS with cuteness!
Chatty little critter  xo  5-d  Lmao  Love Him XO
gorgeous
I just want to point out that us Pumpkins have been at war with Porcupines since before humans petted them and offered us to them as treats. 😤 😡 😡
I didn't know they made noise! Omg! 😭
Thats so strange how the porupine taught her english.
Please tell Teddy to pronounce his consonants....
LOL

That little guy is a happy camper....
YOU have given him a nice life.
i heard he says  ooohh boyy..
Is this his actual voice? Cos I ACTUALLY heard 'Pumpkin' at 0:53

Cuteness exploded btw<3
I want one!!!
OMG!!! that noise!!! Too cute
awwww!!
He sounds very funny though.
This is hilarious !
Aw what a cute little dog <3
Someone needs to add subtitles to this. Hilarious!
I've seen this video many times and yet every time I watch it I'm still delighted by this little guy.
Can Teddy eat popcorn?
Adorable.....!
i didn't know porcupines made such cute noises?? excellent content
Here from twitter, from Pat Seymour!
YESSSSSS
I want a pet porcupine!
too cute.  i predict a SPIKE in views
I just really needed to see Teddy eat his pumpkin today.
I literally watch this video everyday! Cuteness overboard <3
"Good, good, good! Mine! Mine! Mine!
Teddy's like, "Yo, this sh** is off the chain, son."
is that really its voice?
Well that's just adorable
Aw he so cute
KAWAII!
He sounds like Cousin Itt!
That's exactly how I sound when I eat.
he is ADORABLE!!!
Maybe this is where they got the idea for Cousin Itt. From a hedgehog.
Anytime I'm having a sad day I watch these videos and I feel better. :) I adore his cute noises, omg!!!!
I just found this video and I am in love with this little guy. I never thought of it before, but now that I have seen Teddy I think Porcupines are adorable. I grew up with a family of Opossums in the barn at my father's place. They were so happy to see the treats we sat out for them.
Cutest porcupine I ever saw and heard. I wish I could smoosh him. Lol
Pretty old. But it makes me wonder why people treat animals like shit.
Holy cow, I never imagined a porcupine could be so dang cute!!!!!
1:28 "Yum yum?" "Yeah!"
Sounds like a Banjo-Kazooie character talking.
1:25 "This is good"
It freaking talks, I want one! XD
thank you for cheering me beyond measure with this darling little guy...the world is a beautiful place..so fascinating...
This is so darn cute that I shared it in e-mails and on Facebook.
my god that is so cute! I love how hes responding to you like hes in normal conversation
So cute!
Is it just me, or does he sound like COUSIN IT from the original Adams Family show?!!  Wow!
#cute
and how is this related to bigfoot again....?
teddy is SOOO cute
Do all Porcupines chit chat like that?? So adorable.
I. Can't keep watching this video!! I love him so much!!   If I'm having a bad day, all I have to do is watch Teddy eat his pumpkin and I'm cheered up!!!! WE LOVE YOU TEDDY!!! LOVE FROM CANADA!! Xxxxxxoooooo
DID HE JUST SAY PUMPKIN
cute
Very good video! I just became a subscriber of your channel. Please become our subscriber, too.
2:30
"Pretty good stuff?"
"Yeah!"
brilliant!
Awww,so cute
Really? This is the noise that porcupines make? I guess I never stuck around to find out :-)
how adorable!
Does he like to cuddle? ...I wanna cuddle-buddy.
oh he's so happy! hahahaha...
I love how some of his vocalizations actually sound like English.

0:54 "I like it. I like it, like it, like it, like it!"
I'm feeling quite down tonight so I just had to watch Teddy Bear eating and his adorable talking.  He makes my day. Thanks for sharing such a beautiful animal.
Yep. This is what I needed today. Thank you very much.
My only regret in life is that I can not hug this North American porcupine.
This animal makes the cutest noises imaginable, WHY IS IT NOT DESIGNED FOR HUGS?!??!
Fate is cruel.
sooooooo cute!!!!!!
Wow. I had no idea porcupines were so vocal.
Teddy is adorable! I ❤️him!
I think he likes that pumpkin more than corn on the cob lol
I love you Teddy
Is that what they really sound like? If so I want one now.
Totally did not expect the sound that came out of him, to come out of him.  O_O
Awwwwwwwwwww
THEY MAKE A SOUND? :O
Teddy bear looks like a huge hamster no offense but he/she is cute and makes cute sounds
Who knew they were so chatty?   Love it.
MORE MORE MORE TEDDY VIDEOS PLEASE!!!!!!
Adorable!
It sounds like he is mostly saying back off with this camera BS and lemme eat this bloody pumpkin, its MINE!
At 1:24 Teddy says "It was fun!"
Adorable AF ))))
He's making the cutest little noises
spiky doggo
p
How do you keep that as a pet? Not criticising, but the logistics? Can you permanently dequill them? Or what do you do to prevent a quilling? Just caution? Didn't realise they were so chatty.
Oh My F*ng God!!!
HE TALKS❤️❤️❤️❤️
He is very different to what we have here in South Africa. Here they have very big black and white quills that have caused the death of many Lions that thought that the "porkeys" were an easy meal. 
Only some clever Leopards seem to make a meal out of them, sometimes. 
The little "Hedge Hog" is the cute but very rare animal here.
Can you cuddle a porcupine?  I don't think I could resist!!
I noticed it's been awhile since the last post, is Teddy still with us??
Are we sure he's happy or trying to communicate an emotion at all?  Not saying he isn't, but I don't think we can just assume he is.  After all, it's not hard to imagine that  the sounds could be him telling anyone else to back off and not try to take his food.
So cute 😂
Adorabale
😆😆😆😆
He really does sound like he is trying to say "pumpkin"!
do they really make this noise? ill be monkey uncle!!!
do they really make this noise? ill be monkey uncle!!!
I want a porcupine
he makes the cutest noises!!!
Porcupine eating pumpkins.  Sounds like something you'd find in an ABC book LOL
OMGosh!  I will forever see porcupines in a new light.  Is Teddy Bear really making those sounds?  He sounds almost human.
This is the best clip on youtube eveeeer ❤❤
i never knew they made that kinda noise 0.O
PRECIOUS NOISES
OMG! He's so adorable & makes healthy choices too.
Cousin It!
Is the audio in this video seriously for real?

Did this little guy just wonder up on your deck one day or what?
I love animals. We do the same thing when something is delicious.
human be silent
I love this video so much. He's so festive and happy.
Oh, the squeaks :D
translation: Oh yeah this is good! What do you call this shit? This is f**king awesome!! Oh yeah give some more of this...this is soooo goood!! Keep it coming girlie!!!
He says "pumpkin" over and over again! That is SO awesome!!
Who didn't like this video??? Why?? It's adorable!!! I want to hang with Teddy :)
He is beautiful! This is another example of the love between humans and animals. Nothing like it! God Bless this beautiful baby!
Awww so darn cute!!! Kind of sounds like Cousin It! LOL
478 pumpkins disliked this video.
I never knew that porcupines had such a grasp on vocalizations and even emotions in his vocals.  Ted's "Ahhhhh!" is just adorable.  This made my day!
OMG I LOVE THIS PORCUPINE!!
i'm no animal expert
but that sounds like a happy porcupine if I ever heard one.
sounds like an ewok lol
Since porcupines aren't social by nature, what exactly to these sounds 'mean'?
i wish we could make quill-less domesticated porcupines... i'd love to snuggle one! lol
The noises this little guy makes are adorable.
are his teeth red?
do they  really vocalize like that or is it added post production ?
He's just so happy and cute. What a sweetie!
Haha - He said "Like like like. Yea - I like it." xD
Who would thumbs down this
SO CUTE!!!!!
I'm a porcupine expert, and these north american Porcupinicus do not have this vocal range.
-Teddy's inner monologue

"Silence, human. The pumpkin gods have rewarded me this day, and I shall feast like the Kings of Gaul. My adorable mewls of delight are not for thine craven ears - "Paanyannn", I declare! "Paanyannn" indeed!"
so sweet!!!
you made a great video that porcupine looks cute
Funniest thing I have ever seen!  LOVE Teddy, chatty little devil!
soooooooo adorable and obviously well cared for. Long live Teddy
You guys do know that the majority of these sounds are fake, right?
Fairly sure that those vocalizations  are not ones of pleasure but rather  an accompaniment to food guarding behavior and most likely the closest a porcupine gets to a growl.
I didn't know my party's sigil could be soooo cute! <3
@0:19 the noises Teddy makes at 0:19 sounds kinda like  "that tastes good" xD I love the sounds Porcupines make! Very cute.
Next record will be:

"Fuck like like, pumpkin, I am fine. A peanut, hot hot, yum, Like it."

Very PUNK!
aaaaaaawwwwwww!! sooooooooo bloody cute!!
Do his teef never stop growing?
CAN YOU HOLD CUDDLE   TEDDY OR WILL HIS QUILLS GET YOU EVEN WHEN HE'S NOT MAD??
+Johnny elsewhere yeah I can hear him say pumpkin and thank you :)
I love porcupines even teddy he is so silly and curious 🙈
oh my god the noises they make are soooo cute
Ted, your tail is funny!
can porcupines be pets at all?
Haha! @ 1:23 he says "Quite good, really good!" HAHAHAHA
I wonder if he taste like pumpkin
Is he food guarding?
SO CUTE!!!!!
LOL
Wowwww. I like it! Nature for me is all. like my friend. I subs your channel. Have a good night.
This video always puts a smile on my face when I need it. So adorably happy with his pumpkin 😍
He is so CUTE!  I love him.  He sounds like Cousin It from The Munsters. hahahahaha!!!
my heart melted lol
now is this really his voice or is that just some kind of special effect
cute
so
porcupines can now talk?!?!
SO CYUTEEEEE AKA KAWAIII AKA... UM...JUST LITERALLY ADORABLE!! HOW COULD YOU NOT LOVE THIS?!
I had no idea that porcupines made those kinds of noises. I recently saw some footage of a couple of S.American species making the noises, and I wanted to see if our porcupines did the same. I guess it's just a porcupine thing in general ...which is great because I've always loved the sounds that rodents make. (..^_^..)
Oh my God I can't stop watching Teddy I want one he  he makes me smile Thank you Teddy O love you!! awhhhh
Did he have a case of the belly aches later that day?
OMG THEY MAKE SOUNDS! it's so creepy Wtf......
AWWW😍😍😍
Someone from Star Wars needs to be recording these sounds.
He is a very cute little guy.
Oy! Ake!
SoOoo beany Sweet 💕💕💕💕🙌🙌
2:08 "I think you finished that one."
T: "HEY!!"
"Here's another one"
T: "What are you doing?" 
"I'll put it right here."
T: "Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
Plot twist: he was  actually voiced by Michael Winslow
She can talk to porcupines !!
Sooooooooooooo cute in one1⃣ part in the video🎥 its like its saying thank you 😊😊😊😊😊😊😍😍😍😍
How amazing!  I never knew a porcupine could talk.  Wow!
Pumpkins are poisonous for porcupines clearly this owner is abusive and has no business taking care of the poor animal. My mom just came in to bring me some chicken tendies and I was so upset by this video that I screamed at her and knocked the tendies out of her hand and told her to leave my room. This country is so fucked why is this happening?!
YOU CAN OWN PORCUPINES?!?! WHY DO I LIVE IN A COUNTRY WITHOUT THEM?!?!?!
Jawa in disguise? I think so
He sounds just like Cousin Itt.
Someone should tell Teddy not to talk with his mouth full.
i gotta say you have such a model female voice, like you're the person that lives in my gps
I'm a porcupine and this offends me
I love Teddy.
Reminds me of "Cousin It."
Nice marmot.
come on people! its not a tortoise or a dog,if you want to know what it is LOOK AT THE TITLE (not trying to sound mean but really)
It sounded like he said "This is fun" at one point xD
So how do you cuddle with a porcupine?  Very carefully....
This is totally ADORABLE <3
OH MY GOODNESS!!! THis is the CUTEST thing ever in the history of CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
sounds like cousin it
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 ³
I think he says "go away with your camera, i`m eating yummies". I`ve heard same talking sounds from my cats when they eat rare things like meat or fish.
1:15 Legit sounds like it is saying, "Oh god, pumpkin, pumpkin."
I swear I could hear him say "Pumpkin!" and "Thank you!" :D
Teddy sounds like Cousin Itt from the Addams Family!
Oh my goodness, this is so delightful!
Dang it !!!  I loved the video , but I DO NOT SPEAK PORCUPINE ! Well not much anyway ...  Why wasn't this Video released with subtitles so I could follow the conversation ?  ...I mean , I caught the part where he related the taste and texture to a Camas root ... and the occasional "Yeah" and "yep" , "yep" "yeah , sure"  ... and oh ,  "I got it covered , just set the other one down right there , I'm not done with this fine plump gourde ... just leave it right there , Thanks" ... but honestly , I couldn't understand much more ... please revise this video with subtitles/texts , Ok ?
Sounds and Kinda looks like Cousin It.  I wonder if they based Cousin It on one of these little guys.
Can I be as happy with my life as that guy is with his pumpkin?
how did she get pokemon go so early?
Teddy likes it.
Thank you for a clip that put such a smile on my face I'm sharing and maybe some of my friends will donate just because of the entertainment.
Awww
I see he is on a deck is this your personal pet? Does he walk around the yard or is this a zoo? 
Could you explain the environment he is in ?
Thanks!
soooo cute
So cute!
I love this.  Thanks for sharing
Is that the Porcupines real voice?
Made my day!
Rename this, "African Child Tries Food for the First Time."
Basically, he's saying 'Get the @#$% out of my face, I'm trying to eat here.' In fact, he charges the camera on several occasions throughout the video. The noises he makes are cute, the fact that this woman is invading this animals personal space are not.
What does the porcupine say?  :D
so many cute sounds!! What a sweetie.
looks like teddy burnt out a few servers
I didn't know they can make noises I thought it was a dog at first
Not my proudest fap
I love these videos, but just FYI, no need for human dialog...
I freaking love this video. That's about the custest thing.
I love this porcupine. I could cry laughing he is so adorable.
Ahh, he sounds so happy.  X3
the porcupine is so adorable I can't think about the porcupine pluse was it talking I love the way that porcupine talks its so cute
Aww
452 trolls have checked in, I see.
This is so cute I threw up in my mouth a little
is the sound really from the porcupine or just a digitally made voice ??? are they really can speak ?
This is awesome!!!  Sounds like a 2-3 year old girl!  And who's the woman speaking?  Great voice!!!  Should be on TV or radio!!
OMG porcupine noises are cute
SO freaking ADORABLE. Happier about a pumpkin than I'll ever be for anything.
OH MY GOD WHAT ARE THESE NOISES THIS IS ADORABLE
Well, at least we know where "It" got his voice.
I can't help but thinking that what this porcupine is saying. Probably "if you touch my pumpkin bad things will happen to you.
so kawai
Cousin It must have been based off Teddy
I would like to see his reaction if he would eat a watermelon.
она же угрожает
He said it I heard it, PUMPKIN !  LOVE YA TEDDY !
OMGosh!!  I had no idea that they could "talk" like that.  This is so adorable!!!
The physical and vocal resemblance to Cousin Itt makes me think that Teddy Bear is distantly related to the Addams Family.
They found Cousin It!!!
I love him Teddy your adorable
I can understand everything that this little chap is expressing... Is this a fake or real, unedited footage?
OMG!!!!My friend has a porcupine just like this one
This is the most adorablest... is that a word? what ever, that creature is adorz ;3
OMG I WANT ONE SO BAD!!
When did Teddy start talking at
soooo cute
awww how cute
11m views.
Cousin It from the Adams Family,?
what kind of lonely sad piece of shit dislikes this video?
He's telling stories while he's eating, ADORABLE...
do you pet him
When will there be subtitles for Teddy?  His vocalizations do sound eerily like speech. :)
rated very high on the adorable scale
He is adorable!!  I've seen them around but only looked one in the eye a couple of weeks ago for the first time.  What a strange creature, intelligent, this one had an odd visage, like this black rod with eyes, like some alien. lol  Then yesterday I saw one on the side of a dirt road with it's face chewed off. Poor thing. We have a lot of those vile fishers in the mountains here.
The Lil MF was talkin
Thank you Ron funches for bringing me here. This is my new, restore faith in humanity clip.
Sounds like an Ewok. Didn't know porcupines made sounds. Love the internet; learn something new every day.
He's like a little monkey
I LOVE Teddy Bear.  ♥
this is the cutest thing ive ever seen in my entire life
OMG! He SO vocal and adorable. Love this little guy.
The noise it makes!!!! OMG LOL!!!😂😂😂😂
i didnt know that they did that sounds lol
Spanky can't get enough of his videos,   she seems to understand everything he says  ahahah
Instead of Teddy Bear, his name should be Cousin Itt.
so fUCKING PURE
found a wild Pokemon on the Internet
I demand more footage of this Porcupine eating things.
This is so precious that it brings me to tears. God's amazing creatures! Thank you for sharing Teddy with us.
Fascinating!
i never knew they ate pumpkins
I will never get over those nommy noises of his. So freaking cute.
Donald Duck in disguise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HA HA
0.52 "It's a pumpkin" he is so cute.
Oh my god, it sounds like it's talking hahaha! I wanna translate it. Excuse the expletives, lol.
Lady: "Well, I think Teddy bear found some pumpkins for Halloween! What'd you find, Ted?"
Teddy: "OH man nigga! Fuck yeah! Fuck! (chomp chomp chomp)"
Lady: "Did you get it? Pick it up!"
Teddy: "AWWW YEAHHHH YEAHHH! AWWWWHHHHH!"
Lady: "Good boy!"
Teddy: "HMPH!"
Lady: "What is it, Teddy? Pumpkin?"
Teddy: "I'm fine, fine. Hell yeah!"
Lady: "Can you say "Pumpkin?"
Teddy: "Alright, fuck that! What the hell is that? Fuck! Hell yeah!"
Lady: "Looks good!"
Teddy: "Aww yeah, I'm not gonna lie, fucking pumpin, man. I like it! I like I like I like it! Fuck yeah! It's fiiiiine! Fuck, baby. Oh yeah! "
Lady: "Yum yum?"
Teddy: "YEAH! Fuck, oh yeah! Oh, I lost a bite (piece of pumpkin falls off) Fuckin' A! Fine, oh well. Fuck, baby. Yum yum yum! I got a foot, uhhhh… it's fine! Fine. Fuckin' fuck. Mothafucka, YUuUUuUUUuum. PERFECT! cough ahhh! (chomp chomp chomp)"
Lady: "I think you finished that one."
Teddy: "AWWW! Fuck!" 
Lady: "Here's another one, I'll put it right here."
Teddy: "Thank you! Thank you thank you! (heavy breathing)"
Lady: "What do you think Teddy? Is that as good as pumpkin pie?"
Teddy: "I THINK! Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh! AHHH!"
Lady: "Pretty good stuff?"
Teddy: (pause) FUCK! Ohhh yeah! Yeah, not too bad! OHH YEAH! Fuck yeah! All of it, right there, (chomp chomp)."
Lady: "Good boy Teddy."
Teddy: "THANKS!"
did this racist ass our quinine said I'm fine nigga? porcupine aren't born racist they are taught
This is just...I...oh, the cute! 
::I die::

}:)
OMG THOSE SOUNDS ARE SO ADORABLE
So cute the way he talks.  LOL
What!!!!???
Is that real his voice?or someone doing behind him?!
I can't believe like a voice of cartoon character!😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
442 WEIRDOS don't like this video.... :O
this video changed my perspective of the world. my chirakas are now alligned
How did you teach him to talk,Or did he just learn it
O_O
I had no idea that porcupines spoke ewok.
No anime character could touch on the cuteness levels of Teddy Bear.
Anyone else want a Porcupine for a pet? I do. 😏
How adorable is Teddy??  Love his little voice while pumpkin munching.
Is THAT where they got the idea for Cousin It on "The Addams Family"?
this is the cutest thing ever!!!
His sounds remind me of the original cousin It from the 60s Addams Family tv show
I wish I could understand Porcupinese.
Those tiny pumpkins looks cute....
Oh my gosh, I never knew how adorable these guy are. It is odd, they do sound like they could speak. I mean human speak.  It's so wonderful to see something loving his food so much.
I just cant even!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! :# l have no idea wat is hapening but so CUTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! >.<
Okay this porcupines mouth needs to be washed out with soap my porcupine doesn't curse half as much as this.
That's no porcupine. It's clearly a spiky piggie. Pfft ;)
I know he said "I like pumpkin" around 55.
He sounds like Cousin Itt from Addams family
This made me tear up it's sooooooooo cute I love teddy bear :)
ممتع جدا
OK I Am in love with him.
watching him eat that makes it look good
Last year my cuz told me to watch this and I'm watching in 2016
OMG he's literally so excited he can't handle it
I love Teddy Bear.
Teddy Bear is so cute!
You're teasing this animal. Leave him to eat. Sheesh.
who knew porcupines were so expressive?? This is adorable!
OMG he is so adorable. I had no clue how vocal they are. Is he your pet?
That bugger gives the watcher an almost toxic load of cuteness look&sound. I'd buy me kevlar clothes just to hug him.
Now that I know porcupines make noise my like fot like 13% better.
The pauses followed by sudden exclamations are hilarious.
I can hear him saying - good and like several times! this is cute overload
✿⊱╮a d o r a b l e  chatterbox indeed ✿⊱╮
omg Ive never seen anyone talk this much while eating! hahahah too cute. :D
1:41 Fuck, fucking hell, hell, hell, fucking hell, it's very good, fuck fuck fuck, fuck fuck, fucking hell, fucking hell, it is very good, GOOD, suck suck fuck fuck, suck suck emph, emphemphemph, emphemphemph, emphemph, emph, emphemphem, perfect, gaard, thank you, GOOD! emphemph, emph, emphemphemp - Haha, I think you finished that one - WAAH - here's another one! - WAAHAHA! - I'll put it right here - fuckfuckfuck, fuck that - You're welcome - What do you think Teddy, is that as good as pumpkin pie? - Fuck that! emphemphemph, MMM - Pretty good stuff? - Hey, heey! I love this... Piie.. Fuck that! emph, emphemph, emph - Good boy Teddy - Fuck!
Oh so very precious!
428 people are at war with cuteness.
as cute as it sounds,it's obvious this animal wants you to leave him and his food alone. i think it's horrible.
Didn't Snoopy speak making those noises?
My heart just exploded out of my chest! That's adorable!!
HE SOUNDS LIKE YOSHI!!! >:O
He sounds like Cousin IT of the Addams Family, only you can understand Teddy better :-)
+Zooniversity Teddy looks so cute~! He may look cuddly, but I wouldn't want to risk it. Haha! 
How long have you had him? ^^
This is really interesting. I guess our speech must sound as incomprehensible to him as his vocalizations do to us.
I wonder how many other species of animals make vaguely speech-like vocalizations like that?
I wish I loved anything as much as this little fucker loves pumpkins.
sound like a dog
It's cute
This lady has a hot librarian voice
bear is holding a conversation this is good
Haha, 2:09 "I think that one's finished""Woman, I will TELL you when I'm done!"
Wow, I would so cuddle that nose!
Sounds like a Gremlin.
I cry.
he's a bit of a rude one...
I wanna hug him but I can't.
I thought she was fast-forwarding the video as it sounds like a human talking...but that's how they sound?  So cute!
Watch this and say it isn't cute. I dare you
My professor sent me here lol
I like this dog.
He makes more sense than most politicians we know.
omg so cute :3
That is one happy porcupine!!!! LOL...
THANK U RON FUNCHES
Wow. He sounds so close to human speech.
He is so cute. :) How long have you been caring for him?
Man he's answering her questions! I don't know what the hecks he's saying to her but he's answering her! Pretty much the CUTEST THING EVER!!!
Oh come on. It sounds cute, but what person who has experience with animals doesn't know his vocalizations are him telling her not to go near his food? He jerks up towards her every time she moves in for a closeup. He's trying to chase her away. It's animal defending-its-food behavior. He just happens to make sounds that are cute to humans rather than growls.
First instinct is to cuddle......what's he saying? My heavens. I never knew they made such noises.
I would never have guessed that that noise would come out of that animal.  Very cartoony and super cute.
Theres no way this sound is legit
This is just the kind of stuff  you need to get through life. news of bombings and shootings,pressured to do well in academics, college applications,being broke,sports,things that cause stress which seems to be like 90% of all things and events now.
this is like one of those pockets of air you luckily run into to keep you going through of life.
thank you mr porcupine for you have made my day.
This has to be one of the cutest things I've seen in a long time.  He's so adorable.
Why is he in your house? And why are you making money off of a wild animal? You should be ashamed of yourself! Let him go!
porkupines are pretty docile animals even in the wild. I have came across a few when out hunting and they have no fear or agressiveness when provoked. I even brushed back the quills and picked one up by the tail one time. He just simply looked at me. I then put down the creature and let him waddle off
He sounds like Cousin Itt!
If you slowed down the audio of the last half I reckon it would have sounded like a porno movie. The little fella was hitting all the notes.
it's like having 1,ooo  orgasms
That's the way, fatten him up on pumpkins & then roast him slowly over an open flame...delicious. :P
We have a type of porcupine out here but to be honest i dont think i ever seen one...  and wow the noises he made...  i dk why but yeah i just watched the whole thing.. i am always amazed at how sweet most animals are.
They make the weirdest noises!
Little ELF sounds! That must be where they get them from for movies and things. That is just GREAT.
The Pugs want to initiate Teddy Bear into their grumble regardless of the fact that he has sharp claws and prickly "spines".  ;-)   OMG, I had no idea that porcupines made sounds like this.  He is precious!


This and the rest of the Teddy Bear videos should keep The Pugs amused for weeks to come (yes, the dogs watch YouTube animal videos - they are a great babysitter especially when you need to do something in the evening without "doggie disturbances").
How is the person holding the camera this calm?
Why are people putting thumbs down this is cute!!im so mad!!!
I didn't know they were so wordy
I WACHED THIS IN MUSIC I THANK IT IS FUNNY
He's not excited, he's pissed off that ur so close to his food.
Im glad this is a wildlife rescue centre and not some random person feeding -  thanks for giving these critters a home Allison :) 
Too often, people buy exotic pets on a whim then abandon them when they're too much work or they find out they are not allowed in their city or town.
He's cousin it!!
Anyone else feel like his body language was saying, 'these are mine, piss off'?
Wow he sounds like a Ewok and a Pikmin.
😂😂
Теди хороший милый парень. Спасибо за позитивчик!
OMG It sounds like Cousin It from The Adams Family Show.
that is sooo adorable i only watched this one video but, it tempted me to subscribe! yaaaay!
slows down and plays backwards

"FLOOP IS A MADMAN, HELP US SAVE US"
ok stop trying to make the animal talk we don't live in a fairy tale world dumbasses
Dispite what it looks like, I'm pretty sure it's a squash... Not a pumpkin 
Not that it really matters...
he's saying leave me alone while I'm eating or I will shoot 2000 quills into your face
OMG, I NEED HIM😭 this is by far the cutest thing ever
cute as hell .. love it!
Super cute!
Awwww bless him!
i just wish the woman would shut the hell up.
It's a Pokemon
Holy shit it's so fucking adorable! Can't resist the cute
"GET THAT CAMERA OF MY FACE!!!" and some profanities...
what a chatty little creature! did he actually respond to your "pick it up"? or is that just a coincidence?
Omg the woman even sounds like the porcupine mother from Over The Hedge
awwwwww the sounds are so cute. I wish I could give Teddy my pumpkins; he's adorable.
This video was shared and made many people happy. Thank you for showing us a little heaven on earth. Teddy is sure lovable.
When you want to talk about your day but you're really hungry!
Teddy is very cute, he's sounds like a puppy lol. It also sounds like he repeatedly tries to say pumpkin! I would love to see more Teddy videos☺
He's so cute. <3
It sounds like an animal crossing villager.
that is so adorable.
I make those same noises when eating cheesecake. Teddy is just too adorable <3
I never knew a porcupine talked so much or what they sounded like
VERY KOOL. IS TEDDY STILL ALIVE. I KNOW RODENTS DO NOT LIVE LONG, HAD TWO CAVIES, & THIS SEEMS TO BE LAST VID MADE. HOPE HE IS. XX   ;D
Love his little paws there. they remind me of totoro's hands.
Can the obnoxious human commentary be edited out? PLEASE.
His response to the human voice and the sounds of delight as he ate the pumpkin was most interesting...Thank you for sharing this ...   first time I heard a porcupine sound...
Those noises = uncanny valley
Sounds like he's really enjoying that pumpkin!
it sounds like the squirrel from disney's the sword in the stone
Were those real pumpkins? 
Porcupines are so cute!
"I can't seem to eat this damn thing fast enough"
What an adorable little guy!  He sure does love his pumpkins. Thanks so much for sharing!
literally me
HE IS SO HAPPY!
sounds like its having breathing issues lol
OMG this is  absolutely PRECIOUS. Thank you for making my week. I'm melting.
so cute <3
a pet that you can't pet lol
I WANT TO HUG HIM SO MUCH
IT WOULD BE SUCH A BAD IDEA
Hard to believe these sounds are really coming from the porcupine but it is a very cute and entertaining video.  Got me smiling that's for sure.
How funny he is! The bigger brother of my guinea pig
this is so cute
Close your eyes while watching this.
Don't tell me you can't hear "Worms: Armageddon."
he is too adorable!!!
Squeal!!!!! So cute!
That's really wonderful!
I never thought i'd want to snuggle with a porcupine, until now.
He doesn't want the Halloween candy he is all in for the pumpkins!😄
is that nicki minaj!!?
Awwwwwww!!!! his lil noises!
Wow. Too cute. Way too cute!
Things I've learned from YouTube #347: Porcupines make the second-cutest noise EVER (the first, of course, being turtles humping shoes).
1:24 "fun fun, this is Fun !"   Wow.
holy lol
I swear it sounds like Teddy is actually talking.  It just doesn't sound like noise to me.
Is he still alive?
1. ew he's like a little gremlin.
2. can you zoom out a bit?
I don't even know how I came across this, but - That. Was. Adorable. And I also love how you don't talk to him in "cutsey baby/animal" speak. THANK YOU! I find animal videos that have human companions with high-whiney-octive voices very annoying. Somehow it's ironic to say that to someone with an actual porcupine... ( ! )
Up next: KALAHARI BUSHMEN: porcupine hunting :D
YOUR VOICE IS SO SEXY
he has a lot to say
OMG!!!!!! Cuteness overload!!!
So cute i wanna eat it!
Teddy actually says Pumpkin!!!!! And "I like it, I like it, it's nice"... Cutest ever!!!! xxxx
Animal Crossing really nailed the sound of animals talking.
I totally get it. That porcupine really spoke to me.
He's so cute! I can't stop watching this!
Can you pet it?
ha ha ha ha .. Just to cute....
This owner sounds like a total condescending bitch.
This fake nonsense annoys me.
precious!
I feel like he should now open a door to the next level.
What does he feel like?
This video and Ted made me soooo happy and warm inside. Thanks for posting. It's so wonderful. Smiles.
"Can you say pumpkin?"
No. He can't. Teddy's a porcupine.
Adorable!
Mighty Magiswords!  Porcupine Magisword!
i never knew porcupines were so talkative.
Oh goodness, he sounds so cute.
HE SOUNDS LIKE A LITTLE SQUEAKY-TOY. I WANT 50 OF THEM
This is too much.
I desire to hug him.
wow, do porcupines always make noises like that?  i had no idea!  that's so cute!
ron funches
My reaction to chocolate!
This guy is too much
I didn't think I've needed a porcupine but now I need one.
he is so sweet!!!!!! like a cartoon lol
aww thank you for posting this
thank you mr funches
Thank you Ron Funches
Would he bite you if you tried to touch him while he was eating his pumpkin?
Cousin Itt!
TIL that porcupines are actually Pokémon.
Dear god, it sounds like a freaking Pokemon
Wow.  A pet porcupine?  Brave woman!  Lol!
His fur looks soft!
That was so cute I think I just ovulated.
His "Banter" is quite adorable. ;)
Porcupines are wild animals, they should stay in the wild. Even if the person who made this video actually has some legitimate reason for keeping it as a pet, releasing "cute" anthropomorphic videos encourages people to see them as potential pets. Wrong on so many levels.
I LOVE Teddy!
Seems to me more like get that camera out of my face
I swear he actually said pumpkin
The 384 people who have disliked this video have no souls
Wow, now I know where they got the voice idea for "Cousin It" from the 1960's TV show "The Addams Family".  Cousin It sounds JUST like this.  Amazing!
Ahh...the sounds of pleasure
Alien language and roar?
now i know where sonic get sound lol
HOLY SHIT PORCUPINES MAKE NOISES
Basic bitches and their pumpkin flavored everything amiright?
Oh MAAAANN!!!!  This was SUPER cool!!!   He is SOOOOO adorable!   Now I know where they got the voice of "Cousin It" from on the 1960's TV show "The Addams Family".  Cousin It's voice sounds EXACTLY like this.  It's truly amazing.
BEYOND CUTE!!!!
what part of Ireland is he from ?
CUTE OVERLOAD!!!!! I WANT ONE!!!!
well someone is an adorable chatterbox..
So cute! And sounds like Cousin Itt!
I didn't know they made such cute sounds! CUTE!
Ha ha ha ha ha ! IR-RE-SIS-TIBLE ! I didn't have ANY idea that this animal could be such a chatterbox xD !!! It's a real conversation and he seems to be extatic ! UNIQUE ! I adore : hilarious xD !
It sounds like he says "It's good I like it"
WAAAANT
what it said?? since you do not provided CC. Please transition what porcupine said?
MORE VIDEOS PLEASE.
I think I heard him say "back off" and "thug life" a few times...
cutest thing in history
Completely adorable.
I WANT THAT THING!
Teddy you are ADORABLE! :)
Lovely creature
I had to restart my computer. Adorable.exe was taking up all my ram trying to buffer this video
Those look like gourds  to me. He's still cute as bug though.
I love Teddy.
He's so happy!!!
"This is FUCKING A-MAZ-ING!"
he looks so soft....hard to believe that all those hard quills come outta there....
at any rate..he loves him some pumpkin...
What a funny wee character! :o]
I just cannot get enough of this video.  It's my go-to when I get stressed out.
this is the cutest, most sweetest thing I've ever seen
this is the cutest, most sweetest thing I've ever seen
It's so cute how he talks. I swear it sounds like he says "pumpkin."
oh wie lieb ist das ! soooooo süüüß <3
this is so freaking adorable :) I just cuddle him which would probably be a very bad idea :P
Something about the audio seems faked on this.
Man, that's one happy little dude. =)
0:18 oh, that's good!
AWWWWWW
I've never seen micro-pumpkins
they must sound hysterical during mating season
>BRAIN, this is heart. What the HELL is going on!? Why are my systems critical?
>Heart, this is brain. We have a class ten cute factor going on out here.
>Brain this is heart. God help us all.
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY
He just can't even
SO ADORABLE OMG
COUSIN IT!
OMG!!! Cutest video ever!! Love this!! 💕
The last animal you'd ever want to pet...and it makes the cutest noises, just BEGGING you to want to hug it. I'd go for it.
1:24-1:26: "So good! So good!" xD
@00:10 to 15sec 
Am I the only one that heard
"Goodbye nigga! f*** you" ?

I think he's trying to tell her to get away from his food...
At 1:42 "PAC MAAAAAN!"  Lol
At 1:42 "PAC MAAAAAN!"  Lol
How can you have such a cute animal and not pet him?
Haven't seen something so cute in a while xD
one of few animals that can talk like this one you can hear him say vary good, nom nom nom and as well as thank you and pumpkin. crud words but words never the less both cute and smart
The condescending tone in her voice bothers me.
Hermoso!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2 minutes and 51 seconds is the longest i've ever gone without shooting a porcupine.
Related to E.T.?
I'm in love!!!
Sounds like Cousin It.  :p
That lady has more brass than I do. I'd give a porkypine and its food a lot wider berth than that (disallowing for the length of her zoom lens). Still funny. Sounds like Cousin Itt.
who is she
her voice is awesome!!!  Disney should snap her up
that women makes funny noises
It's not cute.  She's harassing that porcupine.  It's agitated, not happy.
SO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT
Omg that is so fucking cute. I never knew they made sounds like that!
he's so cute... now give him a big hug!
I am sure he said " get the camera out of my face please, I'm a eatin"
hehehehe so funny video
We had these buggers under the house and in the woods behind the house when we lived in Alaska. 

The ones under sounded like they were eating the freaking floor away. Had no idea what they were til I caught one on camera coming out from underneath early in the morning.

I also heard these weird high pitch giggle noises in the woods at night before I realized it was them. I could see how back in the day the natives might have mistaken them for something more like an impish 'being' so to speak. They really do sound weird at night in the dark. Creepy even. D:
1:25 sounds like he's saying "so much fun" :)
As ridiculously cute as this is & I hate to spoil the party but it's not a display of ecstatic joy with the squeaking & head bobbing but rather a defensive display to the effect of 'back of & don't try & take my food' in the same way a domestic cat might growl if you give it something it really likes. But still NAAAWWWWW...
I don't know why i cant stop seeing this video. o.O
So cute baby!
That sound is so unexpected...
😍😍😍😊😊😊😊😊
😍😍😍😊😊😊😊😊
so cute
I swear at 0:12 he says "it's fine my nigger" .. maybe I'm just high though.
Sounds like Cousin Itt
Teddy is cute.
Thank you for video.
Talky thing ain't cha...
youre killing me teddy bear.
I want a pumpkin.
This is must be what Chewbacca sounded like as a baby XD
2:13 "thankya thankya thankya"
I always watch him every fall.  He's so adorable.  I'd love to hear the story of how he became a pet!
I never knew they were so vocal and communicative!!:) They're really cool.
they are gourds not pumpkins
I don't understand if he's making those cute sounds because he's happy or because she's too near to him and he's acting like that to scare her away, like dogs when they defend a toy or something.
who knew porcupines where white chicks
I am Dutch and that sounds like it is saying Lekker lekker, which means nomnomnom.
Sounds like a pikmin...
it should stop "talking" with food in his mouth.  very impolite.
FUCK
This porcupine cannot contain his excitement when he tries some pumpkins for the first time
Animal Crossing speech in real life.
Teddy is telling her to back up, my pumpkin
What breed of dog is this ?
That is the most adorable thing I have seen in a long time. Now to offset it, I must go and stomp some bunnies. Thanks.
Pretty sure this is some kind of Ewok
can you pet a porcupine if you pet them with the grain?
does anyone else hear it saying "i like it i like it i like it"
is this the sound a porcupine usually makes, or has this lady been talking to him so much that it's mimicking her?
He sounds like a Jawa from Star Wars
Keyori pls
I want one!!!
352 people hate their lives.
See, now the problem is I wanna pet it.
this thing sounds like the troll from the movie Cat's Eye!
can you say pumpkin? really? can a porcupine say pumpkin?
Can humans eat pumpkins like this? Pardon my ignorance
Today I learned that anime characters are voiced by porcupines.
Sounds like Adamms family's cousin it.
Good Show cousin IT!!!!!!
made me smile, ty
347 people don't like this? I mean even if you truly didn't like it because maybe you were attacked by a porcupine as a child, to take the time and actually click the thumbs down... wow.
Pika Pikachuu? Pika pikaaaa!
cousin itt!
Porcupines can fucking talk? WTF!!??
Sounds like the characters from Animal Crossings!
so can you never touch a porcupine?
I had no fucking idea porcupines even made a noise, let alone one that sounds like it's some sort of pokemon.
How do you take care of a porcupine without getting their needles stuck in you?
OH MY GOD YOU ARE KILLING ME!! THOSE NOISES ARE ADORABLE!!!
Pork Qpine!
Why kind of dog is this?
I guess he loves pumpkin spice everything too.
IT'S PIKACHU!!
2:16 porcupine starts beatboxing.
adorable !
isnt this the animal that Sonic is
Oshawatt
"Can you say pumpkin?" "Nom nom!"
Adorable...sounds like an ewok if it's real!
My sides
I think i just fell in love with a prick
it's good its really really good! good good!
i never heard a porcupine make noises like that... and @ 0:29 - is he picking it up because he´s being told so? i dont know why, but that freaked me out a little bit :D
I love the sounds he makes!
He sounds just like cousin IT.
"Pick it up."

... Like he wasn't about to do that anyways, lol.
Sounds like Yoshi from Mario Bros.
is that blood on its front teeth?
Can I pet it?  =)
so fake

Edit: wow gold! for me? thank you reddit!
Sounds like an Ework
I just had my first ASMR experience.  I feel really dirty now.
So do you guys trim his quills, or anything like that? even if he likes you, seems like the wrong kinda snuggle would be bad, lol
What kind of dog is that
I WANT ONE.
Ya'know,  I'm thinking that the noises he's making is a warning to stay away. He's probably just protecting his food..I bet if you tried to snatch it away, he'd snap your fingers off! It's cute and all..
TIL I want a porcupine.
🎶What does the porcupine say?🎶
Lol it talks like the villagers on Minecraft :P
It sounds like he's saying NOT BAD..over and over again...lol
Those are gourds, not pumpkins.
He sounds like a character from Animal Crossing xD
Get that camera outta my face, bitch!
LMFAO!lady asked the porcupine, "can you say pumpkin!"
When the camera gets to close I can actually hear it say "back the fuck off bitch".
That's pretty cute.  This video has inspired me to stop eating porcupines.
Nice Ewok!
Porcupine is telling you, "back off, I'm eating".....in a cute, adorable way of course.
Dang! That porcupine is ballz!
The reincarnation of a basic white girl
I LOVE TEDDY!!! <3 XOXOXOX
I had no idea Porcupines could be this vocal.
that dog needs to be groomed....
Good! mm mmm It's good! mm mmmmm
WTF?  I had no idea that porcupines spoke the same language as Cousin It.
I can't help but wonder if he's actually terrified of the woman with the camera taking his food away.
That is so adorable, I'm going to die! Awwwwwwww
he is not excited, he wants you to step the fuck back
They probably didn't feed him for days before filming this.
FeelsGoodMan
So funny the things that people down vote. Several hundred porcupine haters out there? What?
Who knew porcupine's spoke in Jennifer Tilly's voice.
Like a white girl at Starbucks in the fall.
Woman: "Good boy teddy!"
Porcupine: "Yeah!!"
is he saying yum yum
strange looking cat.
Do they all make that noise? Is that a normal eating noise? Is it similar to how some dogs "talk"? If the answers are; Yes, No, Yes then I want one.
Never knew a porcupine could be a pet.
Damn - that'll make a turd.
this porcupine could almost talk like a human
ive heard girls making the same sounds when pumpkin spice latte comes around in starbucks
Ayy Lmao
Can you pet this sort of animal? From which species of dog have you bred with this animal? Please thankyou
1:24 Oh that's good
Is this cousin It?
sounds like cousin It
So this is where Nintendo got their Animal Crossing sound files...
This is creepy as fuck
How dare they be cute when you can't cuddle or pet them damnit!!
How do you pet him?
sounds like when you play a record backwards
How white girls act when you buy them a venti pumpkin spice latte
Huh.,. Did not know that the white girls spirit animal was a porcupine
Did something happen to his nose?
Holy shit it talks! Porcupines talk!
I am having a terrible day but this helped so much. :)
Who teaches a porcupine to talk with it's mouth full........get some manners lady.
Disgusting.
love this
Such a white girl.
What kind of dog is that?
I never new I wanted one.
is this Sonic ?!
How do they groom themselves??
Pumpkupine!!
Precious, truly precious.
Sounds a little like a Ghast from Minecraft.
I did not expect that adorable little 'voice'. Soooo cute!
didn't know porcupines could be so cute!
Gourd, not pumpkin.
Sweet!!  So you don't worry about him throwing his whatever they're called (spines?)
He sounds like Alvin from 'Alvin and The Chipmunks" lol! It's too cute!
that thing has clearly been around humans for too long
omg thats so cute
So cute
Come on people... it's an anxiety reaction to the proximity of the camera/cameraperson (jammed right in its face). Fear of the food being taken, not elation.
My cat was staring at me the whole time I was watching this. lol!
Now I want a tortoise AND a porcupine.
OMG i've never heard a porcupine talk before! wow!
David So on JKnews brought me here.
Oh my goodness. That is so cute!!!!!
minions?
teddy was like: Ohhh, sh**! is that all for me? great, cause i'm hungry! but, GEE-ZUS, where is my dr.pepper? lmao..
Cuteness overload!!!!!!!! INITIATING SELF DESTRUCT! WITH RAINBOWS!
I don't think he can say pumpkin.
Sounds like hes saying "good good, yum yum"
it talks
love this little guy!!
He sure sounds like Cousin It
How do I explain the feelings I have right now?
Whys his teeth all red
Have you ever tried putting different kinds of food in front of him at the same time, to see what he likes better? Seems to like corn and pumpkin, at least.
Teddy Bear the Porcupine's Halloween Feast <3
Juste adorable...
evolutions finest spikey bastard
I had roasted porcupine in china, it tastes great!
Teddy bear is cute ^_^
are those child noises made by this porcupine !?!? wow!
a LOOKER and a TALKER, make for a good buddy
Such an interesting video on your wonderful Porcupine friend. I have never heard a critter so happy and vocal. It really sounds like he is talking to you. I don't know if this is normal behavior but, Teddy Bear is a real cute character. What a wonderful unusual critter. I really have never heard that much about Porcupines but, now thanks to this video I know I like them. Thank you for posting this great video.
Interesting that Porcupines are so vocal, I imagine that is due to their covering of quills, which would allow them to say whatever they damn well need to....
too darn cute.
he is just the cutest ever!
Me. Right now. :3
Love how he holds his pumpkin up  when he responds during conversations with his caretaker!
Do they really sound like that?! That is ADORABLE!
So cute i will now kill you and take the animal
The Sounds are so cute
"What do you think Teddy, is it better than pumpkin pie?"
"Ah yea"
"Is it good Teddy?"
"Yeah.... Yeah! :D"
Looks like Teddy Bear found some GMO pumpkins!
it sounds like a creature from minecraft
He sounds like those characters from Banjo Kazooie
G
He is adorable. How he talks.
Great, now I have diabetes from all this cuteness, thanks a lot! XD
ADORABLE
on dirait qu'il parle
I have watched this 20x and I never get tired of it
Ah that's adorable. :-D
Cute. I love the little noises he makes!
IT'S TALKING!!! OMG!!! AWWWWWWWW!!!!!
CUTEST SOUNDS EVER!!! I had NO idea they MADE sounds! Holy shit!! Saw this on Top 20 funniest videos and died a bit from the cute!!
He's actually practicing a speech he's going to give later.
I'm sorry but who would wanna have a porcupine for a pet? Not that I have a problem with it, it's just those things are mean. I had a few run-ins with porcupines in the past.
CLACK clack! nomnomnom :D
I'm waiting for it to start speaking like an Ewok.
Sounds like a minion at some times XD
He like try to say something=)
Jk news! <3
I love the little noises he makes! He sounds like he's talking, too cute!
when I make this noise while I eat, people think I'm having a seizure.
HOLY SHIT IT'S COUSIN IT!!!!
Oh my gawd... how freaking adorable!!!! XD
The woman has the most sensual voice.
What the fuck was that talking?
this is so cute
I could listen to Teddy talk all day with his pumpkins!  His voice is just adorable!
He is saying pumpkin ..amazing... I like pumpkin. Sounds like Cartman :)
My moms dog watches this video and loves it!! She actually loves all of Teddy's videos!!
Dawww so cute!! I love u Teddy Bear!!
When the food's so good you gotta talk to it while you're eating.
He's REALLY enjoying this pumpkin
That porcupine was talking as sure as I am now..  I think Noam Chomsky should watch this video and open up the discussion of Porcupine Linguistics.  Awesome little critter.
Teddy Bear is precious! I never knew porcupines made a sound.
0:38

"Pumpkin!"
"Can you say 'pumpkin'?"
"I did!"
Muito bonito e gracioso seu porco espinho. parabens
Chipmunk. Cheeks
I just love all his little squeals!
hahahaha yes, it is Cousin IT !!!
Wow, why does he talk so much ??
Sounds very similar to when a cat or dog is eating and you get too close to them they worry you're going to take their food away!
he really doesnotlikeyou putting the camera so close to him..
Such a sweetie ^_^
Oh, you mean Teddy the Talkupine? or is it Torcupine?
Ja wie geil ist das denn, der vertreibt einem jeden kummer.  Was niedlich.
He said, what is that, its good. He keeps saying good
I can hear him say yum yum yum over and over again hehe
que es lo que come?? no son de utilieria esas cosas?? no le hacen mal???
Teddy doesn't seem chatty so much as irritated at being disturbed while eating.
pokemons exist!
Cutest shit ever
My heart is MELTIIIIING over Teddy Bear the porcupine 😍😱
Teddy Bear is so cute but is he really making those noises? I would like to believe it, but I think we are being had. It sounds like a child speaking with the sound sped up and then sychronized with his actions. Maybe I am wrong I hope so.
no he can't say pumpkin omg
Love it, this is a dont try this at home but you guts know what your doing. thank you
I love him
Just curious how you keep a porcupine. Do they have quills? Or are they removed?
I'm allergic to adorableness!!!! 😱
For some strange reason, this is terrifying to me. 0.0
ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
its  a pokemon and it likes to say quack qlack
Whats the deal...its on zeekly and it shoves me back to this censored site...I went there to get away from google tube...the lords of spying and censorship.
Teddy is such a cutie and makes me laugh so hard.  He was talkative in this video!
this porcupine speaks pretty clear at times: at 1:25 sounds like she says "that's good". at 1:31 sounds like she says "yes" in response to the owners "yum yum". So cute. at 2:40 sounds like she says "not bad". at the end when owner says "good boy Teddy" her response "thanks"
I love Teddy Bear!
Ever so cute, my friend Rickie saw one for real in America and attented me to these video's.
THIS IS A REAL LIFE POKEMON
First of all, Teddy Bear you are to cute buddy.  Loveoflife how can you use that site name and talk about HATE & MURDER. This video isn't about you, calm down.
. _. It sounds too unreal to be true..so cute. Like a cartoon chipmunk talking
His voice/sound is so adorable! Too cute!
Teddy bear is so cute. I think every animal on this planet should be respected, loved, and not taken advantage of. I wish people would realize that we should be stewards of this planet and live in harmony with all life. Just a dream though, but maybe one day that will happen.
What's he/she saying??
He is so cute
Now I want to see him eat a baby human.
Omg lol Awww I love this video whenever I'm sad, I just watch this and I feel better!!!! Teddy bear is adorable!!!<3
NIBBLER!
funny
He is REALLY trying to say things to his humans. Animals do that when they are too domesticated, they behave like humans.
We should all be Teddy happy.  :)
jk news made me come here
I'm here because of JKNews
SO CUTE makes me want a porcupine. Haha
JustKiddingNews brought me here! :D
Away from the cat side of youtube, on to the porcupines now ◠‿◠
I think he's trying to pronounce pumpkin , not a easy word for porcupine I suppose.
I'm in love with this porcupine and I just want to watch him eat pumpkins all day.
It kind of seems like he's showing food aggression. It's still super cute, but his movements remind me of an animal that thinks his food is being stolen.
He looks deceptively huggable.
best video ever
i love Teddy Bear so much!  he is beyond precious!
What a chatterbox!
Please make an Instagram page!
tooo qute!
I LOVE this !!!!
he's telling: leave me alone!! 4 real!
My new goal in life is to be Teddy Bear's best friend :)
This is so adorable!!!
CUTE!!!
So it is decided, I will be adopting a porcupine
ohmugurd adorable. Too damn adorable. Stupid adorable
That video was so sweetly cute I think it gave me girl parts...(O.o)
This is about the best thing I have seen in forever.  On a side note, three days ago I witnessed a child killer trying to commit suicide while police tased him. (Yes, really.)  I needed this video.  Thank you, and thanks to Teddy!
I found it really cute too but, I only have a question, is it legal to have that kind of animal as a pet? I mean this is a WILD animal and I would like to see all of them in the wild but, there is some special events that makes it impossible for them to survive in their natural environment. What's his story?
NOOOOOOO, IM ALLERGIC TO ADORABLENESfkdsbakbsdfubdsmbgieakbdznalowksd
omfg did he just talk :O <3
I swear, it actually said pumpkin...
is that the noise they always make? or do they growl when frightened or upset?
AH IT'S DA CHEAT
"Can you say pumpkin?" "Pyawak."
Holy fk a real wookie
... and now we know where george lucas stole the ewok sounds.
those are not pumkins.. looks more like oranges
Where's Berta Lovefuck peddling her cunt cookies?
OMG this porcupine sounds just like cousin It from the Addams Family!
So this is where Pixar goes to get it's voice over actors.
Whoever thought a porcupine video would be so easy to fap to?
I could swear he is saying, "pumpkin". Crazy.
Is this a human dressed as a porcupine?
wtf looks like a rat
0:40 No he can't.
This is one of the most adorable friggin things I've ever seen/heard in my life.
Reported this video for abusive language, at 1:24 the porcupine clearly says "What the f*ck". This is unacceptable.
He is just Awesome....
I gotta say this is an awesome person taking care of Teddy.  
You Rock !!!!   And Teddy is super Awesome !!!!!!!   With his slight baby like speech,
Haha, do porcupines really make these sounds? Their vocal chords seem pretty similar to peoples.
it sounds like a pokemon
faggot anteater
WHERE THE FUCK CAN I GET ONE OF THESE
Super cute!
why can't women be this excited when they meet a nice guy like me? instead, they friend zone me and go for those asshole fundies.
Hire him to eat the pumkins the kids make. Him sitting there at night eating there creation would probely be more scary than cute.
OK. That is the cutest damn thing I have ever seen or heard.
He's trying to let you know that you are too close to him while he's eating.
adorable!!!
@2:35 he says "I love it."
Being that 'pines are as dumb as a rock, I tried very hard to find evidence that the audio WASN'T dubbed.
Did she ask it if it could say pumpkin?.. Silly bitch.
WHO THE FUCK would thumbs down this video?
Fucking autist.
The cutest everrrr.  So talkative...and sounds like Cousin IT from the Addams family.  :)
That is one spikey kazoo
Eww, people using google plus to comment, way to cave.

Now onto the topic of this video:

rofl I never knew porcupines sounded like small dogs
#Video ROFL
FAKE!     'pick up the pumpkin, teddy!' and he picks it up. Nonsense! The noises and narration was clearly dubbed in later. Still the animal is very cute.
Cousin It is alive and well :)
1:25 I swear I heard him say; "This is good."
Cute, but why the hell would a Porcupine be able to "say pumpkin"?
that is the cutest thing ever!! omg!
What you didn't see is the owner lacing it with cocaine...
So adorable!
Is that his actual voice?
He has thumbs!  IT'S EVOLVING!
Too funny!  Sounds like he's really saying Yum!
I want one now
OH MY Goodness!!! SOOOOO CUTE!!
i criyedd...
I see an awesome potential for subtitles.  Anyone want to try it?
This guy needs to be a character in Star Wars Episode VII.
i wish i knew what exactly he's saying !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST vid and the conversation is so catching
I like it when she tells him "It looks gooood."   :O)
Soo cute.. Almost wana pet him :P
Hnnnnngh...
So cute and funny - at one point I would have sworn he said thanks ;-)
that looks plastic pumpkins...are there pumpkings that small?
Teddy is my new hero.
I guarantee this is the cutest thing you have seen today. Hands down.
Pretty neat. Never seen a #porcupine eat. Sure is devouring that #pumpkin
That is precious it makes me want to cry! He's so smart and I had no idea they could make that sound!!! Did the woman raise him from a baby? She's so blessed to have such an amazing animal :D 

He's got such a cute little sound and he can actually say words - that is incredible!!!
he sounds like Morph!
wait they actually tried putting a costume on him? who thought that'd be a good idea?
You people that believe this stupid shit are just as stupid.
I didn't even know porcupines even made a noise...that's so cute
If I had a pet porcupine, I'd listen to him eat all day long.
Is that squeaking he's doing real or was it added for effect??
Hes so cute xx
"Can you say pumpkin?"

IT'S A FUCKING PORCUPINE
sounds like an elf hahahahaha
Sounds like a puppy lol
I WANT ONE NOW
as long as he is not being territorial that is super cute
what an adorable voice.  what species is this?
WHY DOES HE SOUND LIKE THAT? THAT"S WHAT A PORCUPINE SOUNDS LIKE?
<3 Teddy
OMG THIS IS SOOOO CUTE! I WANT A PORCUPINE NOW!
Animal Crossing
Aww cute. But I had no idea porcupines sounded like that lol
How can something so prickly sound so cute?!
I know what he´s saying: Shut up and get off.
Damnit I want a pet porcupine!
He's just like "FUCK YEAH, THIS IS A BOMB ASS TREAT!"
I could NOT stop laughing! My two toddlers were in tears gigglingnat how absolutly adorable Teddy was!!!
Could he be more adorable?!!!
What the hell. At certain angles his nose had voldermat or whatever the Harry Potters fella name is , in his nose
I had no idea porcupines made such adorable vocalisations. Nor did I know that they loved pumpkins. :)
And I thought Kittens and Puppies were cute!!!  What a cutie!  Is he really a pet??
How freaking cute is this?!
I love this little critter and his talking :-) I think he is saying, "You better share the Google ad money you're making off this video with me!
It's cute but like most animals, he's talking because he's trying to keep her away from him treats, lol. She's annoying him.
what is with the red on his teeth?
This is cute no matter how many times I watch it!
Sonic discovers pumpkins
What creature enjoys eating a raw pumpkin? They must have starved the porcupine prior to filming just to get this reaction out of him
02:47 Looks like his tummy got full. :) Adorable! <3 <3
Sounds a little like a TonTon from Star Wars
@ 2:13
"Thank you thank you thank you"
I get the feeling that Terry shouldn't eat anything after midnight. Should never take a bath either.
Cute. I could live without the woman's voice-over though. Kind of ruins it trying to pretend the porcupine is talking back to her.
Which just goes to show that even if your a bit of a prickly character you can still be lovable.
This is unbelievably adorable.
Can you say pumpkin

ted: Omnomnomnom
HE SOUNDS LIKE CATERPIE :o
LOL. that's not the porcupine talking, that's just the woman behind the camera making the noises.
is so cute
He sys very good  this is good at 1:23
I never knew Porcupine's made such cute noises :D
Hahaha, the sound he makes is adorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Even though its intelligence is not on par with a human's, a creature able of that level of expression of experience deserves to be treated as best as possible.
EEEeee!! He's so happy! :D
It would be incredibly unwise to let me near Teddy Bear. . . I don't think I could resist snuggling him, and that would end very poorly for me.
It's all about that "Yeah!" at the end in response to "Good boy Teddy."
How funny! I've never heard a porcupine before! That's adorable!
He sure does like his food.
Um.....Oo...creepy yet cute....but mainly creepy. also i think he is telling you to get the f*** camera off him and leave him with his food :))
oh my good it sounds and looks like an ewok :D
Teddy now holds the #1 spot as the most adorable creature I've ever seen....AND heard!!!
Wait did Teddy actually say pumpkin at 0:42
I didn't know porcupines made such weird noises......weird lol
so cute...how do you have a porcupine?
Какая прелесть!!!
Is it even real?!
I wonder whether he picked up the pumpkin because he was told to or he would've done it anyway.
I'm curious to see what would happen if you backed off when he's eating. I don't think he'd protest so much because you're not threatening his food supply then. Humanize him all you want, he is an animal. Cute as a button, but an animal with instincts. 
Every vid I've seen of Teddy, he protests the most (I'm calling it protesting, not 'talking', which is humanizing something to make people feel better, imo) when you're right in his face or trying to take his corn way ('helping' him). 
So I'd be curious to see what he's like when he's eating without you right there.
"Mine! Nom Nom Nom! Mine!
I wonder if they based the voice for The Addams Family's Cousin It on a porcupine?
Is anyone else left thinking who has a porcupine as a pet? Cute video though.
진짠가
I'm curious, how does one interact with one's hypothetical pet porcupine? I mean, you can't pet a porcupine, if it misbehaves you'd have issues handling him/her as well.
not a hug-friendly Teddy Bear
GREAT video!!!   With what kind of camera did you record this?
THIS IS SO CUTE WTF
Kind of sounds like a Jawa from star wars.
I know he said ive got a pumpkin and its good. You can hear that clear as day a few times
I would hate to have a pet that sounds like that.
Tell teddy I said love u! Lol ur like I think u finished that one. He's like noooeee not done!
Goal number 1 get a porcupine
This is actually really healthy for him .
~Cute little bugger .
Wish Teddy Bear would have bit or "spiked" that rotten bitch jamming the camera in the poor creature's face and exploiting him. Poor thing looked terrified at times and looked like it wanted to bite her. Animal cruelty must be stopped!!!!!
Who knew Ewoks were real? Another blow to George's creative legacy ;) Very cute video.
Cute. However, it is obvious that Teddy makes the most sounds when you put the camera in his face. That's because he's annoyed. His natural reaction is to protect his food from being taken from him, which he thinks you are going to do. Like Peter Adams said below, those are at least partly warning sounds.

I would hate to think you kept putting the camera closer to Teddy just to get him to make noise thinking that it sounds cute so you could get lots of people to "like" your video.
That voice kills me
it's a pokemon!
1:53
Teddy: "Hey hey FUCK OFF!"
XD
I really hear Teddy saying......my, my, my, pumpkin, or  pumpkin pie!   The rest is Teddy's verbal expressions are of happiness.   And, his human loves it too!  Are porcupines, like, very smart?  Or, Is Teddy a freak?   ;)
He reminds me of a Pikachu.
FYI:  If they swallow the seeds and poop them out, it can grow pumpkins next year.
Oh my goodness, how cute!  Is it normal for them to make this noise?  Do they talk?
Hahahaha im stoned as a mother fucka and seeing this make it so much better XD
This video was on top 20 funniest
WHAT KIND OF POKEMON IS THAT?
What a little cutie!
A year older and it's just that much cutier! :D
Wow, I didn't know porcupines made a noise, especially one like that!   Thank you for posting this.
You guys should lend his voice to Disney or something lol.
He's freaking adorable!
What a cute porcupine. I really enjoyed watching this video :)
Are you sure he's not making the noises because he's getting annoyed at the camera?
What a lovely little being! He made my day with his little monologue.
so cool! i think teddy is ready for a nap. Sounds like he's actually saying "good" quite a bit into second half of video or i've lost it
A serial quiller
it sounds like a cartoon animal or pokemon
I want to hug him.
cousin it!
+10 puercoespín lince de las sabanas top en taringa???
He is sooo cute!! Love his noises and his little face! Read the comments and some of you people are evil saying bad things about it! This is why I like animals better than people sometimes!
What r those made out of
Play this video for your dogs.
Mas feliz que puercoespin comiendo calabazas
Sounds like the noise a Pokemon would make!
SO CUTE! I Never Even Knew Porcupines Could Even Talk.
This begs the question, Teddy is adorable of course, but how do you pet him?
he sounds like cousin it from the adams family teddy is so cute from suzanne mason
It's so cute, it makes me sad no one can't pet him. :(
Too cute to watch.
I get the feeling the porcupine is saying "back off" not "yum."
awwwww~ he's too cute!!! awesome video~!!! thanks for sharing!!!
Damn. Those are some small pumpkins.
Sounds like my annoying neighbors in animal crossing.
Great, now I want a porcupine
does it really make those cute sounds?
Sounds like a Minion!
OMGoodness, is this for real, please I need to know or I won't be able to sleep.
He sounds like an Ewok.
Ha! Funny
Its like an Ewok
How can this video have 2 million views, when there are only 150,000 people in South Dakota?
can't tell if he's being cute or if he's saying STAY AWAY FROM MY PUMPKIN!
Sounds sort of like The Thing on Adam's Family tv show. I have a talking cat, but didn't know there were talking porcupines. Adorable!!!
So which Pokemon is that?
As a mod of /r/aww I definitely approve this fuzzy little gentlequill.

~snoop doge, reddit prodigy and basement hero.
I want a porcupine as a pet now.
It's the cutest thing I have even seen xD
Cute, but those sound like warning sounds. "Get away, this pumpkin is mine!"
Can you even safely pet a porcupine? ._.
How would someone handle a porcupine?
YOUR TOO SLOW
Lord
he is absolutely losing his mind over that pumpkin
I've never seen anyone keep a porcupine as a pet before! Learn quill work! You have a constant supply!!!! I'm jealous
who the hell knew porcupines could sound THAT adorable.  I'm stunned.
Looks like he's being territorial at certain points. Almost like a dog protecting its food. When she gets closer to him, he looks like he's lunging at her.
Do porcupines always "Yum, Yum" when they eat or is he really, really enjoying that pumpkin?
LOVE!
OMG, that voice is the most adorable thing I've ever heard!!
I think Cousin It taught him how to speak
Pumpkin fed porcupine!  Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I totally cannot get enough of this little guy he so adorable and the chatter as he eats just makes me laugh out loud thanks for another video keep them coming!!!!!
he loves his food, what a funny noise they make, its most unusual:)  my cat purrs when he eats, the only cat we ever had that did this:)
OH MY GOD
yea he can say pumpkin yes, if you implant somthing that makes him speak..which is fucking unrealistic.
That's so adorable!
Feel like lettin my freak flag fly ...
this is cgi
That's exactly how I eat pumpkin pie.
god that is scary
Demasiado bello
Sorta like R2D2 but less gay.
I literally can't even right now.  It's voice...  So cute!
THANKS TUMBLR.
He is cuter than any cartoon I ever saw ! If he wasn't a porcupine I'd squeeze him and kiss him!
Om nom nom!
Is he speaking Ewok? ;P
Oh so enjoyed this!!
Whoever disliked the cute porcupine needs to move to a remote island away from everyone else.
I never knew porcupines made those noises! 😍 So cute!
“Good boy, Teddy.”
"Thanks!"
lol
Such a cute creature!! I want give him a pat, I want give him a hug, I want..... ahhhhhhhhh~ OUCH!!
Is that how they really sound?!
OMG!! I want him so bad,but my husband says im crazy.I think that is the most adorable little thing .
so cute
is that really his voice???
Is he really making those adorable sounds? is he a family pet? I am in awe over all of this cuteness. His favorite time of year is here, hope you get a ton more of baby pumpkins to gobble up Teddy :)
TOO MUCH CUTENESS FROM THE LITTLE GUY.
This is quite awesome
so cute
How can people not like this? come on, it's so cute!!!! lol
My baby pretty much makes the same sounds when I feed her. lol
1:54 Flap flap! lol
So cute!
Super adorable!
I swear to god he said pumpkin 

can you like.. pet him?
Too cute
Teddy!💓
Oh Lord, the cutest thing, ever!!! SO PRECIOUS!!! ~ <3
I had a smile plastered on my face the whole time I was watching Teddy eat his pumpkins. Actually, he made me laugh. He is so stinkin' cute; I love him!!!!
00:16 "That tastes Nice"
omg he sounds like a little cartoon character XD
I love this video...Adorable!
Too much! I love him!
Watching Teddy eat pumpkin is a mood elevating experience. Teddy The Adorable.
I love this video!
I've never wanted to cuddle a spiny creature more in my entire life.
iM GONNA CRY HE'S SO CUTE
So cute
I want one!
Haha it' so awesome
omg this little guy can't be more cute! I Love the sounds he make <3
omg this little guy can't be more cute! I Love the sounds he make <3
So cute. I love to hear the sounds the baby makes.
1
This porcupine watches too much Alvin & the Chipmunks
"You're welcome!" lol! God he's so cute.
This has to be the cutest thing ive ever seen
You want the cute? YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE CUTE!
So Cute. Sounds like " Cousin It " from the Adams Family.....the original show.
He really talks.

"Pumpkin" etc..like..not so..
This sounds exactly like an ewok
This is why I am a libertarian lol
Oh dear, don't let "Cute Things Exploding" see this! @CuteThingsExploding
I just want to hug him ... Or not.
I think it like pumpkins! :D hehe
Next yt search...talking porcupine :) lol
This is why i love internets.
On AFV they had the "Name That Sound" thing, and my family was so confused what it was, and I was like "PORCUPINE!!" and I got it right, and everyone looked at me like "What? How did you know?" and I said I watched this vid.
sooooooo cute! and the sounds <3
Here's some proof for the people who thought Teddy was only 'talking' because she was tormenting him and making like she was taking his food. The whole time, the only time her hand is seen near a pumpkin is when she's putting down a completely different pumpkin next to him, and Teddy's talking the entire time.
Oh my god he's too cute
Such a cutie!!
I'm addicted...I keep coming back to watch this cute little guy.  How freaking adorable!!!
Teddy bear sounds like he is saying "it's good, it's good!"
I never knew that they were so chatty! :3 Sooo cute!
super cute!
Teddy is adorable!
Is Teddy just talking or is he trying to warn you away, thinking you'll steal his pumpkin?
I think he's saying, "Get that camera out of my face and stop with that vomit-inducing narrative!".
do the spines hurt ever?
wow..lol how do you pat him/her?
Is it just me,or is that porcupine sounded like a girl.......
Those noises he made while eating the pumpkin were incredibly adorable. Excuse me while I die of cuteness.
Very cute, but um who had a pet porcupine??
1:25 i swear he said that was fun
OMG Adorable! :'DD
so cute!
Photoshopped.
May I ask you a question?
Only this (or a few)porcipine is able to do those funny, cute noises? Or it's common among porcupines?
(Sorry for bad English)
OMG...thank you so much for sharing your precious porcupine with us...he is the cutest little guy...I had no idea they made all those noises!! God bless!!
' Mogwai ! '  :)
omg i want one
Teddy is to cute man.
Teddy Bear sounds so much like Cousin Itt in "The Addams Family"
He's so hilarious!
I need to go fight some bikers to regain my manhood.
it sounds like an ewok :D  this thing is just too adorable for words :)
That is the cutest thing in the world!!!
Teddy is so adorable !
My heart exploded from all the cuteness! AHHH <3 !!!!! :D
1:25 havin' fun
if only she could shut up so i could heat the porcupine
How do you pet a porcupine?
Oh my god this is so adorable.
So cute.  I just want to cuddle with him... :P
Cuteness overload
I died from the adorableness
OM NOMNOM!!!! OwO
Squee! This is so cute! Teddy Bear sure loves pumpkins! I could actually hear him saying, "Yum, good pumpkin", "Nom Nom Nom Nom",  and so many other words. He's such a smart porcupine!
Aw how endearing. TEDDY! So cute and he REALLY likes pumpkin! So sweet.
That is so stinking cute and adorable....... Thanks!
Man, it just sucks that I used to kill these little shits with around my house with rocks and sticks when I was a kid ;/
That is so Cute, I luv his little voice n noises he makes... Thxx for sharing this adorable little guy  :)
My gosh! how cute he is. I love the sounds he makes... I was smiling the whole time I was watching him. Thank you for sharing!
real life ewok
Teddy Bear has some Ewok in him. Darling - beyond cute!
It sounds like he's saying thanks.
Don't speak with your mouth full - LOL!!!
Who the fuck owns one as a pet here where I live there pests and we kill them
Who the fuck owns one as a pet here where I live there pests and we kill them
I love the lady that's talking to Teddy. She makes the video a lot more entertaining.
The cute is reaching critical overload!
So so cute he made ny day when i think about this cute little guy i smile hes amazing
OMG, that is so cute!  I could listen to Teddy all day long!  It really sounds like he's talking!
too bad you cant pet him
I'm in AWE of your dedication....what a sweet thing to let people see what a porcupine can be without being in the middle of a road somewhere. They are essential to nature everywhere.
That is beyond adorable!
This may be the cutest thing I've ever seen!
103 people got smacked in the face by a porcupine's tail (ouch)
omgggg how do you stop yourself from hugging the crap out of him!
oh my god this .
OMGOSH. SO cuuuutteeeeeeee
reminds me of cousin itt from addams family.
I didn't know porcupines were so adorable. Listen to those adorable little noises!
Where is Bob Ross when you need him . . .
es una ternura escucharlo muy adorable ♥♥♥
OMG...I need one...lol...
Kill it before it lays eggs!
So that's what a porcupine looks like! I've always wondered if their anything like an echidna.
Sounds like cousin It from the Adams Family.
So cute.   LOL.   
Love him ........ (ツ)
Why is "TEd" in captivity? CAn't he exist in the wild?
This must be where the japanese got the idea for pikachu's voice
@1:24"so much fun"!!
sweetest thing of all time!!!
It must be torture to have a pet THAT cute and not be able to give him a huge hug!
SO CUTE!!!!!
He sounds like Cousin It from The Addams Family.
Oh, he is adorable!  Bless every one of his l'il prickles!  Lucky chap; he's deservedly loved. x
Adorkable.
OMG, the sounds are so cute!
HHHHNNNNGGGGG!!!!
It sounds like its talking So cute <3 <3 <3
is that the porcupine squeaking is is that a voice over???
awwwwww <3
Why TB? Why?
porcupines are very cute and very nice....well if your nice to them and obviously dont fuck with a wild one but if you feed wild ones and pose no threat they generally are really nice just do not piss one off
It's like it's saying "I like it" in a high pitched voice, so damn cute! :D
OMG so darling!
if everyone at war watched this, world peace would happen
Adorable!
Where the Ewok language came from in Star Wars...
Oh adorable; but I don't know if porcupines could be a pet. But cute though.
Fake. It's a sock puppet and a guy on helium. ;)
It does sound like he's talking :D
96 people have no soul.
I swear, around 1:23, he said, "This is good." LOL What a cutie.
"What is it Teddy? Pumpkin? Can you say pumpkin?" "Right, Pumpkin!"
ふわふわ ふわふわふわふわ
so cute!!!!!
Adorable
i hope she treats people as nice as she does her pets. animals are savages and humans have the possibility for moral depth and compassion. i don't get why the chowing down or everything animals do is automatically "cute" and people can treat their pets so well and then turn around and hate and treat actual human beings like sh**. such wrong teaching/ideology.
This can NOT be real.
So now I need a porcupine. And a pumpkin patch.
This made my day, hats off to Teddy the Porcupine enjoy those pumpkins buddy!!
It looks like it´s a `food-defending ´ chatter.. he will probably stop if you move away.
He sounds like a cross between and Ewok and Eric Cartman
Oh, he is ADORABLE!!!!!
Yo-ho...? A-hoy!
Ahaha so precious! It's like he jumped right out of a Disney movie. :D
He literally sounds like a Happy Tree Friend.
He literally sounds like a Happy Tree Friend.
AWE!!! Porcupines just became my favorite animal! xD So CUTE!
Cousin It!
Which zoo?
When's the next episode of this little guy coming? I'd love something new!
i could have sworn i heard him say its a pumpkin,of course its good
OMG he is so cute!!!!
He so reminds me of Cousin It!
Ummm what the fuck.... this is not cute at ALL. This practically disturbs me I cant even watch the whole thing with the "rheaheahhe ehrrrehaerah" shit WTF
Now I know who did the voice for Coz It on the Addams Family.
Teddy Bear is a cute little thing. He sounds like and Ewok from Star Wars. :-)
imagine a bunch of them all making noise all at the same time
Rodents are freakin' funny creatures.
This reminds me of a kitty we found near a summer house in Turkey, meowing loud calling for its mother. Kept meowing while drinking the milk my mom left, the result was hilariously adorable.
He sounds like cousin It from the Addams family sometimes.
Love Teddy's eating, especially corn of cob.  Noticed he was looking at the camera more than usual.
I would swear right around the 2:40 mark, after she asked "Pretty good stuff?" he went "Hmmm..not bad."

BRB dead of cute
Is it speaking in Animal Crossing tongue?
i would name it pumkincorn
So kawaii
this makes me so happy
That's one weird looking cat...
I swear these sound like real conversations between an adult and a young child.

0:35

Keeper: Aw. What is it Teddy?

Teddy Bear: Uh... uh...

Keeper: Pumpkin?

Teddy Bear: Yes! It's a pumpkin!

Keeper: Can you say pumpkin?

Teddy Bear: Uh huh, pumpkin! Yum yum yum. Yes, pumpkin!
Zo schattig!!!
Too cute, I can't handle it
happy noises ^_^
Красава есть жи.
This is the best thing on earth i'll take 14
This is the best thing on earth i'll take 14
He seems rather grumpy.
Looks like a critter! Ever see the film Critters?
Забавный или забавная :)
cute name
Cutest creature ever :)
This little guy is extremely adorable!!! I'm curious, are his quills sharp still, or have they been smoothed out at the vet's or something?
@1:24 I am pretty sure he says "what da fuck?"
OH MY GOOOOODDDDDD
HE'S GIVING ME CAVITIES
dam you can at 0.54 you can clearly hear him sayin, ( I like it )
LOL he sounds like He's sayin I like it, have a listen before 0.56
He almost sounds like he's saying omnomnom. XD
What the actual fuck did I just watch?
Its shaymin from the pokemon movie
Oh god this is too cute I'm gonna vomit rainbows.
I can´t with my life, OMG is so cute -
It sounds like Ewok LOL so cute
I swear I heard him say pumpkin.. TWICE!!!
He is so cute 
Is he your pet?
Never heard a porcupine before, so stinking cute, sweet little fellow. Thanks for the video! 😊👍
Not necessarily better than pumpkin pie, but definitely better for his teeth!
Sounds like "Cousin IT"
omg so cute
D'awew!
I swear to bird Jesus that he says "I like it!" at about 0:55...
this is just way too cute for words! what a darling!!!! :)
I love Teddy!
:O :D THIS IS SO ADOREABLE!!!
porcupines are so dumb i want ten of them
Am I the only one hearing the porcupine say: Ah yummy, yummy when he first started eating.
What the heck I never knew porcupines made noises let alone cute little nasally squeaks. Didn't knew they enjoy pumpkins either :o
Cute.... I sound exactly like that when I eat apples. MY APPLES!
To me it kinda looked like he's annoyed by the camera... But its hard to say.
I love this wee chap x
So cute!
I want a porcupine right now!!
pikachu!
awwww
I make similar noises while eating...
My little dog sometimes makes somewhat similar sounds (he is not as "talkative" though), maybe because he is approximately the same size, except being a dog, hes doesn't make them while eating, but when he smells a "girl" dog.
prickly on the outside, soft on the inside hahaha so cute
It's amazing to me. This porcupine is saying, 'pumpkin',. I swear.
Cute funny little guy
its like he is saying words sometimes
Yes this is cute, but do people realize that the cute sounds and movements stem from this small animal feeling threatened by having a camera stuck in his face while he's eating? It is called "resource defending behavior" and is a sign is distress in the animal exhibiting it. All these cute videos are the direct result of the person filming essentially terrorizing this animal while he's trying to eat.
Get back!  That's MINE!!!
<3 Teddy I love you!!!! <3
I swear it sounds like he's say "hey, get back" when she gets to close!
Is that really what they sound like? That's not a voice over?
Wait they actually make noises like that? This makes me so happy!
Do all porcupines "talk" or just this one?
I never knew a porcupine sounded like this!
I hear "This is good" "Num num num" "Pumpkin" and "It's good" "Like like like"
Please don't overfeed this lovely creature! Obesity is bad for animals too!!!!
CUTE!!
made my day seeing and hearing this little guy
Did he tell her to get back? LMFAO!!!
Hah 2:39 not bad <3
He lover's those pumpkins!! I never heard them talk before...
at 2:06 he clearly says "GOOD!" haha!
Dafuq is that pokemon? I want one!
at 0.57 bear says quite nice!!
Literally crying. He is way too CUTE!
The fuck....are they supposed to make that sound?
talkative lil guy
god bless for all the love you give to teddy,
I heard that zinc is good for your sex-drive and pumpkin seeds are full of zinc. There's gonna be one randy porcupine running around soon. :)
awwww it said i dont know loL!
so annoying lmao
Such a sweet precious little guy. So many meaningful intonations . . . beautiful . . . he's talking to you! If only we would all listen and respond 100% to life forms, as you have done
Wau! He speaks. :D My chinchila rearlly speaks. :(
I am waiting for his antennas to pop out ! lol !
Is teddy an alien disguised has a porcupine ?
cute animal videos are killing me
How utterly adorable!
OMG I didn't think those noises were real, sooooooo cute!!
Sounds like he is "talking" so much because he feels the person is too intrusive when he is eating. I get the feeling he might lunge out and bite the lady suddenly.
How do you not get poked?
oh my god its like a fucking grimlin. Kawaii!!
did he eat that whole pot of pumpkins?
Tremendo banquete
I have never heard what noises a porcupine makes almost sounds like they are talking so adorable this fella is you just want to squeeze him but that might be a mistake love your videos of this rare pet
What a greedy little glutinous porcupine.. noises are pretty cute though.
That is the most epic thing EVER! He just waddles around happy as can be, eatin' up pumpkins, chillin out, and talking, AMAZING!
his cartoon voice is the best ever
Back to Narnia you go!
Nice porcupine
He's speaking chipmunk!
hes so adorable. can u actually pat him with gloves on? can those quills be trimmed down so he;d be safe to pat and hold? whats his real diet like besides the treats?
If I heard something making noises like that in the dark I would freak out. lol
"I like I like like like it" so cute!!! lol
you have to admit he is smart and cute and if i had him i would make him my house pet, I think he that damn cute :)
They should have named him Kenny, and all the noises would make sense.
They are truly adorable :) ...If you are in the big north woods, just don't forget and leave your Ax out where they can get to it, or you will need a new handle.
As an animated Porcupine fan, I have to say this is absolutely adorable.
i love how chatty he is ^^
Reminds me of Cousin ITT for real!
Always love when a new Teddy video appears. What about a Christmas video for 2013?
Worth watching ... over and over... what a sweetheart and well taken care of too!
Is that the sound it actually makes???
im here because of sparknotes. i want this porcupine..
Dis iz mai punkinz u kant havz itz!
He sound like one of the characters from the Marion saga universe. Any way it's cute
I WANT ONE
2:36 I don't know, not bad
oh my goodness. this is outstanding.
is it actually talking?
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
so were the spikes removed?
where did you get the porcupine?
I didn't realize how cute porcupines sounded awwwwe!!!!
BEST animal video on youtube hands down!!!
Awwwww
it sounds like he's saying "ohh yeah" haha (:
I haven't had a girlfriend in five years. My heart has turned to stone and I have built a wall around it. But this....this..just FUCKING ADORABLE!
OMG this is adorable
You're allowed to keep a Porcupine as a pet??
This is fantastic and adorable. Oh wow.
i hear him say; "its quite good. I like it." at some points. hehe.
is this the cutest thing ever or what? better than cats!
I want what he's having
I just want to HUG Teddy...but I know that won't end well for me! He is ADORABLE! <3
If you asked a biologist why porcupines evolved quills, they would likely tell you it was to prevent them from being eaten by other animals. However, porcupines clearly evolved them to prevent the species from being cuddled to death by humans who find them unbelievably adorable.
He can probably type!!
God damn it Ross
Oh god I want a porcupine now.
That's awesome!
He's talking I swear
adorable!
i thought those pumpkins were plastic
Omg!!! ♥
What's that?  GOOD !!!
omg I'm convinced porcupine are pokemons
that's awesome
I'm totally in LOVE with Teddy Bear!  He's amazing! More Teddy, please!!!
Tak tu zvieza jest
Seriously the cutest thing ever. Hands down.
I want what he's having
I am so in love with this little guy!  I love his little noises that he makes when he's munching on something he likes.  I could listen to him eat and "talk" all day lol. So adorable ;-)
HOW IS THIS CUTENESS POSSIBLEEE
These are the cutest sounds!
PAMPKIINZ!
Holy Shit...when it made noises...I literally said "The fuck" ..weirdest creepiest shit

The lady who is speaking should narrate children's stories. Her voice is comforting, kind, and soothing.
THE level of cuteness is unbearable.
THE level of cuteness is unbearable.
cute cute cute
I gotta see this little guy every few days to get my giggle fix ... ahhhh, that's way better. Love you Teddy Bear
I didn't know Porcupines could talk?
I think we just found a porcupine who is so enhusiastic about eating pumkins that he made me say WTF.
I can't get enough of this little guy! He can Talk!!!
He sounds like one of those characters from Animal Crossing!
oh my goodness. oh my goodness. awwwwww.
I am in love with this porcupine
I'm guessing he doesn't let you pet him ;)
Don't make noise eating, that is rude teddy!
IT'S AN EWOK!!
Question: does he have quills/spines? It's be hard to keep it as a pet if he did.
What. The. Actual. I can't believe I just sat here and watched this. Wow.
SOOOOO CUTE
It sound like he is speaking chinese or something
I heard the 'wtf' @ 1:25 as was mentioned below, lol.
Ewok? omg this is too cute!
02:33 He's like : " May I eat the second one now? Ah ,first eating this!"
I'm sensing a little food aggression here.
This made my day along with Teddy's other videos! So adorable!!!
That brightened my morning...love it!
dirty mouth little guy
He say "right"  XD
Ho, hi nigga! :) 0:12
It sounds like he's saying, "good" in several spots. :)
YOU EVIL PERSON!!!!! 

LET SONIC RUN!!!! FREE!!!!!!!!!!
be still, my heart.
I THINK I NOW WANT A PORCUPINE
2:14
- Thanks.
- You are welcome. ^^
Teddy Bear sounds like Cousin It from the Addams Family.
He said "Pumpkin" at about 19 seconds. I'm glad you brought out another Teddy Bear video thank you so much , I'm glad he's doing well and still talking :)
are these aggressive sounds or just general porcupine chatter? id be scared lol
Cute
Es un perro xD
Damnit Ross
HE SOUNDS LIKE COUSIN ITT!!!!
Aaawwww its looks so nice, I want one! :) (a pumpkin not a porcupine, just to clear up any confusion)
Why does something you can't cuddle have to be so cute????
he's sooooo cute; is it typical for porcupines to vocalize this much?
Squeee!
OUCH MY HEART
I STARTED CRYING MY FEELS CAN'T HANDLE WHY
This is the cutest thing ever. Instant Joy. Thank you!
To jest URSON, a nie jeżozwierz. -.- Ursony są krewniakami jeżozwierzy, ale wbrew pozorom, bardzo dalekimi. Ursony w przeciwieństwie do jeżozwierzy utraciły wiele cech gryzoni i obecnie trwa spór czy nadal je do nich zaliczać.
it sounds like a pokemon
Zooniversity is a travelling wildlife company that teaches people about animals. They are literally a Zoo University. I'm sure they know what the sound means and what they're doing.
klasyka Polskiego kina : )
Wszystko jedno, co to było, skoro już tego nie ma.
You need to see a psychologist then.
Jeżozwierza .. Takiego.. Dużego Jeża
That was prob understood by many that watched..... the viewers are just saying he is precious.  ")
To Precious..... Thanks for making my morning.  :)
Boy is he a cutie.
Is this a pet?
omfg, i just melted
Am I the only one slightly terrified?
Wow I never knew porcupines could sound like puppies! :D SOOOO cute!
HE SOUNDS LIKE A POKÉMANZ XD
Unmm.  Sorry ta burst the bubble, but the vocalists toons are a natuRal reaction if an animal distressed and worried that the other animal may take its food away. Notice how every time the other animal speaks it vocalizes? Or how every time the itber animals camera comes close the porcupine slightly lunges? duh
Is that an aggressive sound or?
fucking hell
Kind of reminds me of a giant guinea pig only covered in murderous spikes. :''')
this is so cute and funny at the same time!!!!!!! XD
SOOOO CUUUUUTE! ♥♥♥♥♥!!!!
I HAD TO PAUSE THE VIDEO SO I COULD SCREAM.
OMG that's so adorable! :3
Is that for REAL!!
Good grief! Didn't even know they MADE a sound!
fuck this is adorable
then right after that, it said, "this is fun!"
AHAHAHAHAHAHHA
AHAHAHAHAHA
Hello Zooniversity! I love Teddy; he's obviously so adorable but my question is.... do ALL porcupines make these kinds of noises or is it just Teddy? I'm very curious. If not, how is Teddy able to do this? Was he taught? Raised from birth by you, etc? Thank you very much!
1:25 It sounds like he's saying "This is good!"
AIIIIIII SO CUTE
This has to be the cutest thing EVER!!!!!! I love him.
I would've just ripped out one of my quills and stabbed a bitch.
2:27 - The porcupine said "GET BACK!"
The noises he make are soooo cute!!!
cutest think i've ever seen
