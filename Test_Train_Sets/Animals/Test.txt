hahaha goats are so fucking stupid. I love it.
Dude, when burgers are involved, you can't ask for respect.
Funniest stuff I have seen on here for a while!! Classic!!
The last is fake ^^
I am a goat and I find this very offEEEEAAAA-
nvm..
Oh my god 0:28
The new Michael Jackson's
only youtube!!!
the last one was edited. that i can confirm
0:22 is my favourite!!
1:12..best goat
I'm actually aware of this. I just couldn't help but imagine these goats in the wild confusing the hell out of pre-modern people, making them think there are people crying in the woods.
"The goat cried in the woods so many times we didn't believe it when it was an actual person."
Or something. Cry human, maybe.
Baaaaahaaaaaaaa omfffgggggggvvvvvv cd sxvbhzsrg hb jjf
1:20 was the best
The end though...omfg.
Thanks jack for sending me to weird videos.....
HAHAHAHAHA don't get stoned and watch this HAHAHAHAHA can't stop laughing HAHAHAHA what have I done? HAHAHAHAHA
what does jack watch on youtube.....
i think tht i would be yelling if i was in a cage too
is it just me or do they sound like some of them are screaming "MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
JACK GAP
This is what the Internet was invented for.
2:00 YEEEEEEAH
Where the fuck am I ....
Meh.
Oh man I can't stop laughing at 1:12
HEEEEEELPPP!!!!!
MOOOOOOOM???
ANYBODYYYY???!
transgoat-uality?
Hilarious. XD
Too bad that can't happen. There's nothing like getting stuck in a wrong body, absolutely NOTHING like that.
yeaaaaaaaa. last goat
I've come to a similar thought...

I think I need to go read some tax law or... something smart.
0:24 is hilarious!!!!
2:01 "yeah?"
its a human in a goat body, they are trying to communicate!
Catherine!
hahaha lmao
lol what is wrong with that second last one? :D
1:25 i actually understand the goat better..
I've marked the best parts using up2five. Install the extension, rate and navigate in the video!
1:46 reminds me exactly of Spenny, from Kenny vs. Spenny
2:02 OH MY GOD XD laughed so damn hard
My neighbor has goats... fuck goats!
you're watching a 2 minute video of goats yelling like humans
1:22 This one has Brendan Fraiser's hair cut!
Oh my god. I am dead. I have been laughing for the past 10 minutes, replaying this video. I'm in tears. Every thing hurts. HALP.
1:23 best one
1:45 sounds a bit like my grandpa is falling downstairs... :D
0:24 so thats where Ren's scream came from  lol.
 /watch?v=aBLDUAGsE64
Ahahahaha, foreigners and their pet goats.
Hopefully people know this, but many of these are not goats. 0:21 , 1:12 , 1:37 and 1:59 are actually sheep, and the sounds associated with them are fake.
the last goat is just priceless... but what if they were human once and got cursed into becoming a goat and this is just their way of asking for help.. no? just me? ahahaha.. O_O
O:23 That is NOT a goat, it's a sheep,
Because that phrase comes from the story of the "Boy Who Cried Wolf", and it means that you're deliberately calling a false alarm or you have called a false alarm so many times that nobody believes you when it's the real thing.
I handled the wireless mics at a livestock competition at our fair in Albuqerque. Goats do make some funny sounds. I question if some of the screams are real tho haha.
MOOOOOOOOOOOOM
MOOOOOOOOOOOOM
Press 2 repeatedly. You're welcome.
THE LAST ONE.
1:23 - 1:36 Lost my shit
That Ending LOL
This makes me seriously question why the term is "cry wolf" and not "cry goat"...
I saw clips of this on my local late news tonight and had to check it out.  I reacted just like Jacob Guymon...laughed, gasped, coughed, then cried with hysterics thrown in for good measure.  I'm going to pass this one to many......Thanks, I needed a good belly laugh!
omg i thought i was going to have an aneurysm funniest thing in a long time. And that last one i think was just stupid unreal.
lol pretty sure that one actually wasn't real, sounds like the same guys from /watch?v=nGeKSiCQkPw
the 2nd one killed my sides.
when you think about it, goats are REALLY fucking strange.
the last one was unreal
what if these goats were humans stuck in the body's of goats who just realized what happened to them.
That is so disturbing, like when you hear a fish gasp for air and you can hear their low pitch voices.  It's creepy.
I DID!
The last one is a lamb, doesn't count.
Laughed so hard at 24
1:38 i almost cried
1:24 lol
hahHaha
lol
Lmao the last one... "Eeeaah!"
you can hear someone say "oh my god" after the yell at 0:24
It's almost like someone had the (clearly) magical ability to splice a sound over an image and reproduce it on the intranets as if, you know, someone fucking cared.
PLEASE CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL :)
Sounds like Jerry Seinfeld.
Yeahhhhhh...
0:24   ROFL
1:30 spitting goat was the best
Normal goat: Baaahhh....mmmbbbbhhaaaa....
These crazy ass goats: uuuAAHAHHHH URRRRRRGHHH AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH HUUUUUUUUUUUAHHHHH
I literally cried with laughter at 0:24
Man, I'm at a solid [7] and that just made my night.
It'd be perfect with the business card scene from American Psycho...
Even the dog at the end was confused. LOL
That spitting goat was... indignant!
Someone has to make that video now
Makes me want a goat
00:22 and 1:38 had me laughing, but 1:23 was the BEST!
Maaaaaaaaaa! I almost thought the 3rd goat was missing the top part of its body. Then I realized it was just a big ads black spot. blonde moment!
Creepy...
this might be the funniest video i have ever seen
eh still sounds like a goat
0:24 and 1:39
they're.... evolving... D':
i literally laughed, stopped breathing, coughed, then cried... The 2nd one in was just too unexpected.
can someone please make that come true?
I love this. How can a goat do that? Was a person jammed inside them? And the dog at the end. Oscar for best supporting actor, please. After watching this vid, I had no choice but to compile a video of screaming cats. And chattering cats. And gurgling cats. youtu.be [forward slash] LQQl3TU91fY
i was terrified of goats as a child. if i had ever heard them screaming like this while i was at a petting zoo, i would have totally lost my shit.
I like to imagine they are people trapped in goat bodies
sounds like Obama yelling.
That was the point in which i lost my shit completely, Cant. Stop. Laughing!!!
helllllppppppppppp
HELPPPPP
1:38

OMFG im dying...
Yeah I have a hard time believing the last one is real
the last one said yeahhhhhh...
The dog at the end is all like... "WTF?!?"
that spitting goat is godlike
AKA Congress.
Oh boy lol  its very funny , especially the one that are arguin' with the man
Seems like the one at 0:24 is fake, someone on youtube dubbed over it, if I'm not mistaken.
1:13 DAT QUALITY
Yahoo brought me here. This is a hilarious video!
a sign of the times
Be quiet!  All of ewe!
01:23  brought me to hysterical tears. LOL
doritos ad got it right then !
They're so cute!! 3
The last one fucking got me. Yeah hahahahhahahhahahahahhhahshhshshahshshshshdhjdytewyuj
The one at 1:44 sounds like a confused old man..
... Noone else finds this disturbing...?;___; I'm going to have nightmares now...
does nobody realize the one at :24 is fake?
The one at 24 is fake
The more they hear and listen to humans, the more they try to emulate humans...
The ones at 0:24 and 1:44 sounded the most human. That very last one "Yeahhh" I think actually WAS human, but of course I have no proof.*sigh!*
I can't stop laughing....it hurts so much!!!
Goats are too funny and so chunky :)
Laughing at some silly shit. I wouldn't have missed this, this is two minutes hilarity.
@0:24 LOLOLOLOL
I love the internet...
This is creepy as fuck.
oh like the united stats congress
Halarious!!! Last one is fake though, I helped make it
Booooob! BOOOooOOB!
Ohmyword... This is fantastic.
rapists reincarnate as goats...
You're so fucking original!!!!
This would probably be funnier if I hadn't grown up hearing most of these.
Imagine waking up to the scream of a goat every morning. ..... Yeah, the humor gets swept away pretty quick and the desire to kill kicks in.
0:44 MOMMM!!! Maaaahhm! Maaaa!!!!
@Adam Brown i did it. and it was amazing.
Close your eyes and listen while imagining a bunch of guys in full suits, sitting around a table with briefcases and making these noises
i fuckin cried on the last one oh myg od
0:24 saw lady gaga naked
1:23 lmao! that was highlarious and amazing! that goat seriously had a human soul inside him because he looked like he understood that man. I have never seen anything like this until now. :O
How freaked out would you be if you were walking out alone and heard this without seeing the goat
YeeEAAH! @1:59 LOL!! dogs like WTF??
1:23
over and over again...
"Yeaaaah?"
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Internet.
I have watched this so many times and I'm still peeing myself laughing. Awesome.
At :30, is the awkward guy.
listening to goats yelling like humans
do not watch this video high....lmfao hahahahahah
Quality fakery, my face hurts from the laughing!
Seriously, half of these aren't even goats, they are sheep, do your research! There is also an animal I don't recognize! But not all are goats! Hilarious video though!
Wait...is this real?
nothing wrong with a little sillyness
THEY'RE ACTUALLY PEOPLE TRAPPED IN A GOAT BODY.
Im ackwardly laughing by myself...
Oh my god you are right!
LOL MY SIDES
Ahhhhhhhhhh, ahhhhhhhh first clip
Fake
*baaa*
*baaa*
*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!*
Holyshit I cant breathe.  I laughed throughout the whole video. Shit is too funny xD
Yeah!
Now I am officially terrified of goats because of this uncanny-valley shit.
This scares the sheeept out of me 0.O
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhh
For some of them, I'm just imagining: "Stop laughing and help me! Someone turned me into a goat!"
The last one wasn't even funny? wtf
omgomg IM DYING LMAO
1:23 LOL
this is just sooooo funny! love them all!
dude is the ending real? WTF?
I think the sound clip for the lamb on the thumbnail is fake.. not to be a hater or anything.. but it sounds too much like a dude yelling. lol
Sounds like a really bad trip.
Seriously where the fuck is Bob?!?
That last one made me laugh so hard!
LMFAO the last one surprised me
WTF Nooch...
Only 0:24 was worth a chuckle.  They got nothing on the Doritos goat.
0:24 Lmfao I busted out laughing
Go home goats your drunk
1:18 I'm pretty sure that's a sheep
Goats smell bad.  I don't understand why jihadis find them so alluring.
"hey hey don't forget me" 1:49
the ones that sound like homer and the very last one are my favorite!
0:23 and 1:20 are the best.
goats are the new cats of youtube.
Ха,ха,ха)))Прикольное видио))
Watched this in my language arts class today xD
last one sounds like he is saying yeah
1:23 thats how me and my girlfriend argue ...
That last one was really disturbing for some reason o_o
WHAT?
@1:25 Cuz stone cold says so.
I laughed so hard! Especially at the end xDDD
this reminds me of the Doritos commercial
I work right next to a high school agriculture area and hear this shit all day. Sometimes I think it really is coming from a dumb ass.
1:16 reminds me of the lady from Tom and Jerry (whose face remains a mystery)whenever she saw Jerry lol
Jimi why....
Holy smokes, that last clip has me rolling! 'Yeaaaaahhhhh'
The one arguing with the guy is an Ibex.
Best part 2:00 - 2:05
BOB! BOB! BOB!
or maybe they are humans i goat's bodies
2:01 yeaaaaaaaaaaah
Lol wtf xD
They never learned how to roll their A's
Holy shit is that Eddie Murphy? 0:23
Why is Jimmy Hendrix masturbating to goats.....?
What a strange world.
You owe me a new glass of water and a new keyboard.
1:19 give him his doritos back!
LMAOOOOO
Oh internet... you never cease to amuse me.
Planet of the Goats, anyone?
You've goat to be kidding me
You're "kidding" me, right?  :))))))
Tears. Streaming.
My mom thinks i'm watching weird porn.
I think the one in the barn speaks Yiddish.
The best thing about the last one is the Alsatian in the background. He's just thinking "what the hell is going on?"
And this is why I love youtube so much
That is just the best.
these goats should make a music compilation.
HELP...They CHANGED ME!!!
If I'm correct the lamb at the end said yeah if like he were drunk
1:22-1:36 really hilarious
1:20  Homer Simpson!
Ahhh
Yeeeaahhhh
nope!
Fake?
cause its shite
^^
The one after the baby one looked like a dinosaur haha
the second one would be terrifying at night
lol I would go crazy if I had to live on a farm ahahah
Hahaha damn! Although they do sound distressed :/
hahaha 0:23
Little bit of wee came out.
some of the yells remind me of ha-ra-buh-jee (korean old man) grunt and yell.
I thought you were dead!
1:26 i cannot stop laughing at that.
I showed this to my cat and my cat just yawned.
lol........so true.
1:23

F U too, goat!
why would it?  they're tasty.
(0:45) MOM,......MOM......MOM.
Lmao 1:25
The last goat absolutely killed me!
Thanks a lot. Because of all of that loud screaming, everyone in my house thought I was watching torture porn. It was incredibly awkward having to explain that I was masturbating to a video with screaming goats in it.
not supposed to be OMG LOOK IS REAL

just supposed to be funny. obviously its fake.
1:26 that an Ibex
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG ROFLMAO......... That goat at :22 seconds was the BEST!!!!! Hahahahahaha FRIKIN HILARIOUS!!!!!! "AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!"
Lmfao! The goat at 1:25, has THE deadest stare! "Like bitch, do you know who the fuck you're talkin' to like that?!" XD the spit, was a nice touch as well. LOL
0:26 made me laugh hard
These goats will never get laid.
HAHAHAHAHA
watch?v=Dp0Bt2cbcc8
Pretty sure that the last one scarred me for life
"MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM"
most of these goats are dead.... sorry about ruining your day
The one at 45 seconds sounds like Pee Wee Herman!

1:32 the goat said "fuck"..
que chistoso no sabia que las cabras podian gritar aci jajajaja
Plol

Wilhelm is a great name for a goat.
the last one was 'YEAAAHHHH"
Thanks, M.A. Larson
1:38 - Don't mind us, we're just being goats. Baaa.
1:41 - Ahhhhhhh, holy fuck, it's Justin Bieber! Runnnn!

0:24 AH-MAZING
OMG! The second to last one sounds like a drunk man!!!! xD
I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!
I kept looping at 1:23 That is too funny! :D

0:23 Greatest of all time

1:23 LMFAOOO IM DEAD
Reminds me of "The Bane" from Borderlands 2.
1:23-1:36....arguing with a creationist
new perfect place to commit murder: goat farm
All types of human emotions..anger, laughter, pain, fear &....orgasm...lol ;-)
Sounds like my exgirlfriend.  Almost as hairy too.
ha ha you really stuck it to 'em! Get that low hanging fruit!
Greatest thing since Birds that can curse!
that's some scary ass shit!!!
0:44

Bob! Bob!
01:37 is definitely the best
i warned them not to feed the goats the cheaper genetically altered carrots and oats but they refused to listen
Right? That's the best one, haha!
0:50: MAAAAAAMMMMMM....... MMMAAAOOOOOMMMM
this is exactly what you hear when you go to a justin bieber concert or a twilight movie premier.
2:03 was the freaking highlight of my day
omg copy this url and paste it in a new browser. then you'll have twice as many screaming goats! fucking awesome!
the one at :43 sounds like pee-wee herman
Press the 4 key, then the 2 key. Suspiciously similar...
Wow the goat at the end sounded like it said yeah
1:16 killed me
lmao I don't like goats but that was funny!
goats are very tasty too
Keep pressing 2 key. Just don't waste anymore beer
I was just laughing but then I completely lost it with the goat at 1:24.
God, what messed up creatures.
gay goat 0:32! LOL
1:23 "suck my dick"
My cats freak out when I play this clip!  Great!
I make the same sounds after a few shots
MOOOOM! MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! MOM!
The last one... "Gyeahhhhhh."
@1:24 i died, my stomach hurt from laughing haha faack
Some of these are sheep!
2nd one... so the superbowl commercial with the screaming goat was real?
Why?
words not even fit for a public bathroom wall....but, at least, the video was funny
i love the one that goes gaaaaaahhhhhhh the others are just meh
きっと人間が中に入っている。 amo
I don't think you know the difference between goats and sheep, hahaha
two minutes will never be enough
AAAAAAAH!  UUUUUUGH!
This is getting my wholehearted "dislike"
that nigga at 1:47 is on some Larry David shit
Yeeeaaah!
it's like listing to a bunch of drunk frat boys.
Na mate. It's absolutely shite.
I assume by "gay" you mean fabulous, right? Cause this is.
I'm going to be a goat farm when I grow up
1:15...shall be my pet
Last one is best
"Mommmmmmmm!  Mooooooooom! Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
^^^ seething
0:23 made me spit my beer all over my computer screen!!
Quit sharing your relationship statuses on here
Fake and gay
Whoever voted this down is nuts
0:24 is my favorite xD new ringtone anyone?
Pay no mind to the others, I get what you mean.  :p
1:39 is the killer =))
2nd sheep is hilarious, but fake :(
Wilhelm Goats
I opened this in a new tab and i thought i had a porn pop up
if u people keep talkin about those awful movies they will keep being popular, u people made justin bieber popular.
Please make another Doritos commercial with these guys.
1:23 was my fav. lmaoooo
The dog says, "woof"
The duck says, "quack"
The cow says, "moo"
The sheep says, "whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
It has to resemble a love story for that tired joke to work, genius.
1:39 my personal favourite
Second sheep is best sheep
Second one made me bust a gut xD
Chewing on, yes.  Eating, no.  Goats are super fussy eaters, but they like chewing on stuff.  They are super curious, and they don't have useful hands so their mouth is the way they interact with everything.  Goats aren't really that into sweets. Even sweet feed is molasses and tastes very different from processed sugar.
THAT SECOND SHEEP THO XDDDD
A lot of these are sheep.
There sheep
1:23 Fuc*ing awesome xD
Some of these are definitely fake but still funny 
look at 0:22 and 1:14 sound familiar?
Also, do you think this is really what a sneeze sounds like? 1:23
Think about how good blr is, it shouldn't be that hard to make realistic goat yelling like human noises. 
Made me laugh a lot though haha
The one at  0:22 and I shared the same sound during his monologue
why... can't I stop watching this? ...!!??!!??
County fair when I was about 7 yrs old. Had a bag of cotton candy. At the goat pen I felt a tugging on the bag. I think the goat was more interested in eating the bag than the cotton candy.
try to watch this while you're eating
The one at 0:25 is fake because the background noise cuts out then it plays a scream that is used in other videos.
The last was the best! =)
lol!
this is why i don't ask goats for their opinions anymore
I snorted for real.  I'm at work and my coworkers came in to see what my "laugh attack is about."
Mode 7, more like Goat Heaven.
Sounds like the bidder's assistants on Barrett-Jackson.
goats gonna goat
Even if this is fake something about is still funny
air 

need air

cant breathe
playing 0:25 in loop hahahahahaha oh godddddd
I love u internet !!!!
"What do you think about Zapatero's [Spanish former PM] government?" *spits*
I'M LAUGHING SO HARD I CAN'T BREATHE
0:46 It's Usher!
You're not funny
I was considering getting a goat farm a month or two ago... Maybe I should reconsider...
"yeahhhhh." best part (the last one). the dogs face is amazing 1:59
hahaha 1:22 . It's like the ghost of an anti-social teenager has possessed the goat.
second one LOL
probably best video on youtube
Still a better love story than Twilight
Dingle berry
Damn! Lyn Cassady's method has some serious side effects.
At 1:40 I completely lost it
Lol I like the brown one
HAHAHAHA !
If your name is Matt, never visit a farm with sheep or goats.  It will lead to years of your sisters calling you "MAA-A-A-A-A-A-ATT".
Years.
Lol sounds so fucking hilarious
fake
Fake?
nigger sounds like HOMER
Russel Howard
Am I a failure at animal identification 101, or are 0:21 and 1:15 actually sheep?
That last one though LOL and the way the dog looked after he said it!!!! LOL
See THIS is why you should always puff some buds before going to the zoo.
That last one killed me XD
Epic 1:24

Talk about a bad rebirth XD

Rise of the planet of the goats!

Proving the theory: You cannot win an arguement with a goat.
Ummm...while I like sheep...sheep are not goats. There are several non-goat shots LOL
なんだかななぁ。人間のおじさんの声だよね。

I like the asshole goat at 1:24 lol
Is this real?!
Second last is a remote control car!
I'm fucking dying
1:40 LMFAO <3
They just acquired consciousness and realize..they're a fucking goat!
This is strangely disturbing.
These must be the Luciano Pavarotis of the Goat Kingdom.
Whiteboy7strt would like this ahhahaha
вас наслушаются животные как вы проводите время на сеновале,и повторяют за вами:)
I'm pretty sure the goat at 01:46 is speaking Farsi
SO! FUNNY!
I nearly suffocated! Hilarious
pause @2:03 
stormtrooper
miért van ilyen hanguk? ez valami rendellenesség?
He was interviewing the goat about an old Spanish ruler, an old comment said that and I can't find it now.
2nd one is fake clearly
This has to be one of my favourite videos of all time
hl 2 zombie sounds!
THEY'RE PEOPLE!!!!!! PEEEEOPLLLLLEEEE!!!!!!!!!
That was so fun!!!! 1:23 - 1:38
Why was that guy interviewing a goat?
Nintendo's voice actors for Zelda Skyward Sword ?! xDD
In fact that one in 0:44 sounds like it's yelling "Help!" :)
That goat had a long goatie.
But clearly not unscreamable things
I just died
Genuinely curious: Which ones are fake, and how can you tell?
Too many fakes... But the real ones are hilarious!
I do not recommend watching this at work... be prepared for 00:24
0:24 I actually spit up my water
I want that one from 0:21 !!!!!!!!!!!!
That dog looked so confused at the end
WHAT IF THEY’RE PEOPLE TRAPPED IN GOATS BODIES TRYING TO SCREAM FOR HELP!
1:45 sounds like a nursing home
BISA DIEM GAK SIH???
@markk217 errr. goats
Right On!!hahaha
Spit in yo f'ing face negga.
1:45 sounds like me, when i am drunk and have locked up myself in the bathroom.
These goats have seen things... Unspeakable things...
I'm pretty sure a few of these were fake but the video was still awesome
Idiots. It's fake
Word Life
faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaakeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...
@1:24 what a jerk
xD
You forgot the best goat of all, Chicken Goat.

at Wimp dot com/chickengoat
ooooh! oh I'm dying, this is so fucking funny!!
this reminds me of Pinocchio
any1 went in to help
Primus were right.  Animals should not try to act like people.  But I'm sure glad in this instance that they did. Especially 0.25.
Lmao!!!
That last one was made by Dayjob Orchestra.
I bet the one at 0:27 is going through puberty.
Is there something wrong with them?
O MY GOD! WE TOOK TOO MUCH ACID!
I laughed so hard I was sobbing. Why don't MY goats sound like yelling men?
Just an FYI, that "Yeah" at the very end is actually faked, as amusing as it is.
it's actually an ibex! :)
worldoftanks
1:24 IS THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
The screaming ones and the last one are I'm pretty sure.
I worked on a sheep farm once. This is real shit. There was one sheep that literally sounded like a guy with a deep voice very casually and calmly stating "Bah. Bah. Baah? Baah."
Oh God the last one
I can't
He just
"Yeaaah"
I fucking lost it at the last one.
are some of these fake?
Hit '8', best part of the video.
The second goat.  Is that really him/her yelling?  I swear it's a soundover HAHAHAHA
this video is god's gift to humanity
the second one cracked me up
THEY FORGOT HOW TO GOAT!
YEEAAH!!
its scary to me why is the one that spit so mad ill put his ass so sleep before he hurt someone wow this is so crazy shit
are these real?
Oh my gosh those people have been turned into goats! Will somebody please help them!
Fucking badass warrior goats at 01:37

Metal.
1:39
:o
1:12; best yell.
They say help
Goats sound remarkably similar to drunk college kids at 4 AM.
HAHA SO FUNNAY COMMENT U CLEVER XDDDDDD shut the fuck up and die
Hilarious
Is this real
Very weird, but I couldn't stop laughing.
2:00 YEEEEEAH!
HELP ME

I'M DYING OF LAUGHTER

HELP ME
omg it hurts so much laughter
My favorite part was when the goat yelled like a human.
Goats are rad as fuck.
The one that spits reminds me of the arab I buy my smokes from.
Found a new ringtone.
Oh I fucking lost it at that goat.
this is the fucking best thing to have ever existed XD
me too....
now... what would happen if we went around doing that as goats??
MAAAA!   Maaaaa!   

Where's their mother, anyway?
Ted Nugent should have been included in this compilation.
The last one is fake as fuck
I'm pretty sure they're mocking us....
:23 lmfao
Lost it at 1:45
01:40 fake
I thought the same thing....
0:24-0:26 is fake. you can here the superimposed audio clip in/out.
The goat in 1:24 is being questioned about Zapatero, the former spanish Prime Minister. Even goats have a remarkable opinion :D
And where do you think they got those sounds from? Seriously, is it really that hard to think?
When I shoot Goats in Skyrim, with my bow, They don't Yale like that... So Sad and so boring...
except you're wrong...download Soundtrack Pro by Apple...most of these are stock sounds pulled from that software
This is only funny to people who haven't used Apple's Soundtrack Pro...it's mostly stock audio folks.
Went from worst valentines day ever to best cause if this, thanks :3
I think I just shat myself from laughing so hard. FUCKING AMAZING!
No me he reido mas en mi vida
1:38 I didn't expect that one...
Emaaaakkkk!!!!
The high pitched one and the last one are fake.
i cant stop replaying 1:45
The new Wilhelm scream: 0:24.
Then were two :P OMG!! Die EVERYTIMEE :P
1:24 HAHAHAHAHAH
hilarious!!
Ma*
it sounds like they are all yelling "mom!!"
I keep feeling that the goat is going to rip off its head revealing a mans face.
I DIED AT 1:24
ba.
jajajajajjajajaa!
1:40 

Sounds like two guys charging into a  battlefield or something. . .XD
1:58
Omg I love the second one
THIS IS GOLD.
niggoat
2:01 even the dog was like 'the fuck..?'
im scared of goats now XD
sounds like my ex-wife, lol.
2:01 was the one i was least expecting lmao
Lmao. Just goats having fun.
1:24 -> fuq da poliec
1:44 is the funniest!
i cant stop laughing :DD
And I'm gay , he can shoot his load on my body with that noise ;)
1:24 that goat... I can't even handle it.
The third one gave up on life.
I could watch the second goat over and over again.
The guy cleaning up the goat poop in the first one must hate his life
I make sounds like the 3rd one.
Introducing Goat Super heroes. Lol
the second one is a sheep, just fyi.
i had to stop watching half way through because my throat was hurting too much from laughing...
Damn witches, turning good folks into goats!!!!
Sometimes mother nature has a nasty kind of humor!
hahahahhaha
It's Po-Zest  AAhhhh
1:12 he sounds like the Doritos goat, wow im so easily amused
what am i doing with my life? :S
It's just that I've seen goats up close and the one that I saw with no horns usually had nubs on their heads were their horns would be.
I love that last one "Yeaaaah."
thanks mittzie
I don't care about your private life, or what his name is.  I'm here to see goatse!

. . .no wait.
1:23 is so funny! The goat goes.. Huh?
Noh.
0:25 LAUGHED HARD OMG XD
most of these are sheep not goats...
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah!... [smile]
Not sure what you mean about the "homeless goats" bit, but I'm pretty sure some species of goats just don't grow horns. /female goats don't usually grow horns.
I still don't understand this... those hornless goats, are their horns removed or is it genetics that keeps them from growing horns?
On Valentine's day
The last one says yeah
It's 5pm, I'm hungry and I just tried clicking on the '2:30' to see what part of the vid you mean
The one at 1:03 reminds me of Ladder Goat
A bunch of them ain't goats. Must be a video compilation made by a city slicker. Look up the definition of sheep. LOL
The Men (and Women) Who Stare At Goats.
And we thought black people came from monkeys...
Так вот кто под окнам у нас по ночам орет!
Chicken nuggets at 2:30? Let me guess, other symptoms are bloodshot eyes and cotton mouth?
You jelly?
Because about half of those clips are fake :)
The second one, and the ones at 1:22 and 1:40, as well as the last one are all sheep...
*SPTOO* OOOUUURGH!!!

That goat doesn't mince words.
На 1:20 Это что-то!
Creio que seja um processo de mutação genética, onde as cabras se tornaram em algo maior que os humanos e nós humanos entraremos em extinção... Planeta das Cabras.
0:47 is yelling "mom"
And I love how in the last one, even the dog behind tilts its head as if to say: "Whoah, wtf!? Did he... did he just say that!?"
The one that sounds like Homer Simpson [1:16] is my all-time favourite. Oh, and the goat that keeps going: "WHHAAAAA!?" whenever the guy on camera speaks Spanish to him.
I think its enough youtube for today.
BEST VID ON YOUTUBE
Claro!
i lost it at 0:22 xDDDDD
Last one was like patrick star
eah
0:22 and 1:38 lmao
best scream at 1:38 ... I almost fall from my chair
IM SHITTING BRICKS!!!! :D :D :D: :D: D: D:D:D
Cara, não pode ser verdade...
I imagine them yelling "HELP I'VE TURN INTO A GOAT".
what.... even.... how did I get here...
Only the BEST LIFE EVER.
naaaah can't be
sounds like my mom
awesome, your. life. is awesome!
0:23 is the best
And the best video we ever will watch.
It is wonderful.
The goats ate the souls of farmers who raised them. This is a collection of the farmers screaming for mercy.
oh my god I almost died!! XD 0:25! I'm sick and I started coughing after I lol'd, it was hard to stop and I almost puked. XD gross..
I'm stuck in the loop from 1:24 to 1:36 and tears are rolling down my eyes.... the more i watch it the funnier it gets.
let this be real 
i need this to be real
except it's actually real and awesome.... moron
0:24 is a sheep lol
hey me too! nuggets rock
1:41 is just outrageous because there's a bunch of normal sheep making normal sheep sounds and then they just get yelled at in response. So awesome.
pmsl  the ones at 0.25 and 1.22 woooooo! sounds like they are yelling out like when your on a rollercoaster lol, enjoying themselves
O.o best comment i've read all  night XD
OK. The final goat was the best.
this is so fake and gay and fake and gay
it's 2:30 am and i'm eating chicken nuggets and watching videos of goats screaming 

what is my life
All I can think about at the first one is ozzie osbourne shouting SHAAARONN lol
"MOOOOOOOOOM!"
Goats aren't yelling. Humans are yelling in reality!
they're asking for help!
Yeeah
HELLA FAKE
first one is the best
O MG- That is the funniest thing ever.
Why am I watching this...
1:40 literally made me fall over laughing
1:40 has to be fake hahahhahahahaha
1:44 What? What? WHAT? what? WhAt? What?
i am full of meem
WRAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUH
1:23 and the one after it are my favorite ones xD
lol at the end. the dog's like, "the fuck?"
AHHHHHHHHH!
the goat at 1:44 sounds like a confused old man.
Best video ever.
OH MY GOD at the beginning i was thinking wtf those people need to shut up and it was the goat... omfg
sweet!
The best video I have ever watched
2:03 .... HHHHMMMYEAH!
*SPIT*  RAAAAAAHHHHHHH
00:15 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA I DIED
But do any of them selectively cutout background noise? None that I'm aware of do.
That is wonderful.. <3 I'm not kidding.
This changes everything.
they sound like pee-wee herman
"Boooob!"
MOMMMMMM!
I have a cow named Jairo
1:24 Anyone notice that the goat is saying, "What?!" Clearly he does not understand the language of your people, fast-talking foreign man.
some girl posted the same exact comment this morning lol, weird....
1:28 is where it gotz realz 4 me
Only on fucking Tumblr.

You're absolutely right, no two animals have ever sounded the same in history. Its just preposterous!
1:23 the goat : pff what what what ahh what
0:53 boooooooooooooooooooooooooob!
My parents thought I was watching violent porn
This should be nominated for an Oscar.
1:23. that goat's a king.
I'm literally in tears oh my god
fake and gay.
0:23 and 1:16 are identical.
1:23
Saved the best for last for sure
1:23 LOL
But I lost it a 1:24...
damn, I'm lost again on youtube..
This is the hardest I've ever laughed.
was about to say the exact damn thing, it's fucking hilarious rofl.

I had to stop drinking my water because I started choking.

2:00. Lost it.

1:34 what'd you say bitch!?
I am laughing so hard.

MAAAA! THE MEATLOAF!
this video cure my cancer
wat the fuck! this is scary
Yeaah
Word sista
Absolutely hilarious.
sounds like a dude yelling for his mom
That second one, the goat behind the fence, could cause a lot of problems, what if someone called the cops because they thought someone was being murdered or something
Some microphones are designed to cut out background noise, including ones in cameras.
; ^ ;
Sadly/luckily, they changed this. Those depend more on what you watch now. You might have listened to something by fleetwood mac or watched another video from the same uploader.
Youtube's top recommended video for this is Fleetwood Mac's "Go You Own Way".
0:49 an instant classic ^^
Lost it at 1:14 omg
1:21 OH. MY. HOLY. TARDIS. I'm dying xD

Cracked is terrible. 
By the way, where do you think your profile image was made? Cracked? Funny.
HOLY SHIT, GOATS
1:45 sounds like a retarded 17 year old
This was on Cracked. 

Why the fuck did this have to be posted on /b/ of all fucking places? Cue 12 year olds making "mods are fags" jokes and other inane BS.

Fucking niggers.

2:00 yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
1:23 that goat takes no shit.  I literally died.  

That goat is my new master
Um, llamas don't have horns. Goats are as capable of spitting in your face a llamas, though not known for it.
omg gaots
I was browsing le 9gag when I suddenly heard this, didn't know what to do LOL! #YOLO
I'm a goat and what is this...
The first one kinda sounds like porn.
HOW DO GOATS EVEN EXIST OMG
he's asking the goat about their actual president (españa) and then he agrees with the goat. yep
0:28 2 stupid dogs sound
SOUNDED LIKE A CHICK GETTIN DICKED BY A GOAT
This explains everything
lol 1:44 sounds like me, when i burned my tongue XD
so much fake
1:40 oh my sides
0:22 he realized he is a goat.
This is what happens when you die. You don't go to hell. Your soul is placed into a goat and you're surrounded by ugly people.
So this is the reason my mom keeps trying to convince my dad to buy her a goat for Valentine's day...
He's asking to the lama (yeah, goats don't spit at your face) what he thinks about Zapatero's government, and other political stuff.
OH GOD MY SIDES XDDDDDDDDDD
1:37
the real ones could be funny, if most weren't so obviously fake and gay
My face hurts now, fuck you goats!
what is the spanish man yelling?
fuck you moot
fags
Op is a faggoat.
1:13 i had to stop here. i can't laugh and ruminate at the same time
1:45 "NO, I'm TELLING you man I'm NOT a goat! Just LISTEN to me. Here man, look. its the water, MAN the fucking WATER. Let me show you this shit, look..."
fuck you m00t
1:44 LOLED HARD
>mfw 4chan plants his own flag in Youtube
You should find one that shouts "NO! NO! NO!" all the time.
Le 9gag army has arrived!
HAS SCIENCE GONE TO FAR?
holy fuck i cant stop laughing
1:59: ... YEAH.
I love the dogs face at the end lol.
Tell me Clarice. Hannibal
Eu tenho uma vaca chamada jairo
The one at 1:41 sounds like gilbert gottfried
FAKE
1:25 The man is arguing with a fucking GOAT! xD
Oh god, the second one had me in absolute bits.
Oh gosh I needed this so much today.
You know some weird humans!
My brain when I do an oral report.
1:22 FTW!
1:44 - 1:57 Dee Fizzy's Grampa Voice goat.
Most of the sheep clips are dubbed. Sorry to spoil the fun.
1:24 -  1:35 Pissing myself...
Some of these are fake. The last video is even here on YouTube and the lamb doesn't say "yeah!" like that in the original version, lol. Some of these are real, some of them are dubbed.
Most YouTube videos I see everyone is shouting "fake" in the comments section, even when the clip is real. Then I watch this and everyone is taking about crying tears of laughter when most (not all) of these really ARE faked. You can even hear loads of edit points in the soundtrack (everyone's favorite at 1:20 is a dub of a man fake screaming). Judging by the likes, this has fooled a lot of people......
why isnt this a meme
That's dubbed. Most of these are.
A fair proportion of these are dubbed. Disappointed.
It's funny, but some of then are fake.
1:18 I am crying with laughter
Digital Spy?
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
i'm not worried
From laughing!
I am dying
You start screaming when you wake up?
perhaps one of the greatest compilations of all time
Кто знает. Сколько надо его пиздить чтобы начал разговаривать?
LOL
0:48 ...BOB????
:22 is fake... you can hear the sound clip edit and background noise disappear.
Maybe humans yell like goats. Ever think of that?
1:23 I lost my shit..
JAIRO ME TROUSE AQUI
ахах,сцуки смешно горлапанят
Ебааать!!!!11 Лучше бы они так не делали!
Tenho uma vaca chamada Jairo!
So this is where the yelling in cartoons is dubbed from... XD
Okay, I think that's enough internet for today.
:24 is Homer simpson
me too :P
preciso comprar uma cabra
this gives my life meaning.
TUMBLR BROUGHT ME HERE
oh god, they're so special :D
2.01 Jeeah! And the dog is like dafuq?
Vaca Jairo aprova esse vídeo
what kind of dog is this?
smoke some and than watch this :-D
Ive hear sheeps that are yelling like humans before. Allmost every single day.
2:00 YEEEEEAHHH!!!
1:23 I think the interviewer said something REALLY REALLY offensive for a goat... Oo
Whoever did this had a problem!
0:44 SOMEONE KNOWS WHERE IS BOB?
Some of these are clearly sheep.
sadpokdsapokdsaokdsaopsdka... chorei mano
Is this fake? it gotta be
0:44 potato, is that you? :o
My mental sanity is doubtful, I can't stop laughing at this. Am I the only one??? Baaaa?
ah negão!!!! sempre me surpreendendo
Which ones were fake?
Well, it looks like the lambs couldn't be silenced.
well, i didn't laugh... stupid video
0:25 :DDDDDDDDDD
Three of them were fake. But the rest were real.
The screen at 1:35 i thought that was a human screaming o.o
yeah
02:00 YEEAH.
All the sheep ones are fake and all the goat ones are real. So stupid.
Some of them are fake....like that. Sounds just like some kinda singer.
At 1:25, I would have punched one on the face
Some of them were sheep though.

And the one at 1:49 was totally in heat XD My goat does that sometimes when she's in heat
My sides are hurting since i saw this last night and now i've watched it again i'm in twice as much pain.The best compilation video i've seen in ages.Love them goats.
I can't breathe, call a doctor
This is the best Chris Tucker stand up routine I've ever seen.
I've struck gold
1:09 that goat just asked what can I do for you in a british accent O.o like look at his mouth even >.< haha
that goat behind the fence: heeeelp! Then two goats sound like sheep and then human. :D
THIS is literally the best thing ive seen all day
Findance ;)
0:22 ...Homer?
YEAAH
Me neither xD ''AAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH'
Hahaha =D
I'm surprised that goat did not wear a helmet. 1:44
So who else was totally not expecting 1:40 to sound the way it did lmfao
The last one says "Yeahhhh"? Now I wish a goat would copy the "Won't Get Fooled Again" scream.
Maybe? How about definitely! Listen to those clearly human pleas! Now someone call 911 and get the transmogrification rescue patrol on the case right away! ... 'Who ya gonna call?' 'Goat busters!' ... 'I ain' 'fraida no goats...'
Probably
Goats Will Rise, and then yell at you and sort of complain about everything.
here, let me give you a +1 thumbs up
You left out the Jerry Lewis Goat.....search it
I thought I heard a little bit of patrick star in that last one
actually laughed til i cried, so great
Best ending. "YEEEEAAAH."
The second one tho
1:24 is the best - having an argument with a goat lol
WHY ARE WE ALL YELLING? No tumblr no
omg tumblr why.
Imagine if in every single one of those human-sounding goats, a human is actually in there. The possibilities are endless; reincarnation, brain transplant, a ton of acid.
Translation at 1:23:
Man:  Okay so I want to take a moment to talk about the goat. 
Goat/Lover: *spit* GOAT?!
Man: *Throws up hands*  What do you want from me?  We agreed on camera we...
Goat/Lover: what?!
Man:  We agreed that...
Goat/Lover: WHAT?!
Man: We agreed that we wouldn't take our love public.
Goat/Lover: I HATE YOU!  We did not agree to such things.
Man: Baby...
Goat/Lover: Get away from me...
Man: Do you want me to take away your hay?!
Goat: *gives the "da fu$& did you just say" look*
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE YELLING ABOUT
no it isn't wrong horn shape.
its a spanish goat.

search google and compare the horns.
How did I end up on this video? I've never laughed so hard I cried at 12:53 in the morning before
there are a couple of these that im almost certain are fake
0:23 had me on the floor. xD  lmfao
THE LAST ONE THOUGH
Holy crap... 1:23?!? Now I gotta change my drawers...
This makes me feel uncomfortable
Maybe they're humans, who were cursed by witches and really are yelling because they need help?
WHY ARE THEY YELLING?
at 1:41 it was like they were trying to out scream/out human them lol
0:23 and 1:16 are edited people. Same exact vocal bit, background noises stopped, and using your ears.
What am I doing with my life
That one with the guy talking is an ibex...
Like if Rowynn sent you here :O)
Omg. I really don't like goats but this killed me.
Yeeeaaaahhh.
1:24 The fuck did you say about my Mother?!
:44
Me at the groceries store. lookin for mom.
Well, Clarice? Have the lambs stopped screaming?
holy hell! definitely lost my shit at 0:23
That very last goat almost caused me to choke on chips... freakin hilareous
that ending
LOL Nice.
:D so happy. all the happy.
for the full one that starts at 1:25 the video is called never argue with an ibex
These goats tried out for the Doritos commercial of 2013
1:24 I fucking lost it!
This is the funniest video I've ever seen
god damn it i cannot handle this right now
is it bad that this is what i normally sound like
The one at 1:44 LOL
Go home, goats.  You're drunk.
The goat says... AAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
I.cannot.stop.laughing.
This is the closet I've been to pissing myself with laughter. Definitely succeeded in browning my pants though.
"mom!"
I love the goat at 1:30 he's so interactive with the guy
Reincarnation is a bitch
No my friend has goats and sheep, we see them everyday they really do yell like this xD
Fake
1:16 slaughtered me
0:43 sounds like johnny depps yell lol

Thank you, I enjoyed that
Is that goat aping us humans?
omg my sides :D
raving rabbits @1:39
a compilation of goats yelling like humans
lost it at 0:23
wtf did i just watch
At least 10 of the animals in this video could fit in a blender; 11 if you count the sloth.  Arguably, because he is long but skinny, he could be fed into the blender at a rate of about 3 inches every 10 seconds.  Please be advised that my interest in this information is purely science based.  Thanks and have a great evening.
So cute!!
Some of the animals I couldn't tell what they were.
Awe I wish I could pet such cute animals.

Ho una mia convinzione personale che riguarda il regno dell'esistenza di tutti i viventi sulla terra.Per me tutto quello che c'era da inventare a segno di vita dall'ameba a noi e dalla alice alla balena è stato inventato a dimostrazione per noi che siamo stati capaci di farci un'idea di Creatore di una onnipotenza assoluta,a spavento della nostra piccola comprensione del mondo rispetto all'universo. La natura stessa della vita ha una radice unica,che risale all'Inventore di tutte le cose.Altrimenti non si spiegherebbe  che un leone si effonda in tenerezza con un essere umano o che un gatto abbracci affettuosamente un cane come noi potremmo abbracciare o un cane o un gatto.Qui c'è,ripeto a mia convinzione personale, la mano di Chi tutto ha voluto e inventato a Sua infallibile magnificenza e onnipotenza.

This is a particularly enjoyable compilation.  Almost all new videos, good selection and good juxtaposition.  Well done!  Thank you.
I had a nightmare where I was in my car and I looked up at the front window and saw a distant large body, then I turned my head to my seat window and saw a HUGE sloth staring at me. It was taller and bigger than a 6ft human. Than it started banging on the glass and more of them headed towards me. I pushed on the gas and saw that the sloths were EVERYWHERE in my community. And there were people screaming and running out of their homes because the sloths broke in. And one house was on fire. We were trying to leave the community but there was a huge jam since everyone was trying to leave. So we stopped, stuck on the turn, and the sloths started climbing and hitting cars, and then mine. I screamed as I heard the glass shatter and it's hand reaching for me. Then I woke up @_@ 

I couldn't function the whole day and could barely get sleep the next night :D hahahahaha
Aww this video is so cute :) great job :)
Baby elephant is so cute!!
The lion was adorable!!! I also liked the hedgehog, the otter, and the rat...

OMG! I had no idea they made sounds like that! Awesome!
oH MY JESUS IT'S SPEAKING
ARE YOU KIDDING, HE TOTALLY TRIED. A++ FOR EFFORT.
IT'S SPEAKING TO ME.
He sounds like cousin IT from Adams Family
That's it. That is exactly what that sounds like.
I'M PRETTY SURE IT SAYS "QUACK" SOMETIMES
ANYONE ELSE TERRIFIED OF THIS THING?
"Can you say pumpkin?" 

Obviously not, it's a porcupine, idiot.
Oh what a cutie~! I waaaant him!
<3 lovelyyyyy
Must be related to cousin IT of the Addams family.
Teddy is so cute.  :-)
A-D-O-R-I-B-L-E!!!!!!!
I wanna give it kisses NOWWWWW!!
I had no idea porcupines sounded like this
i wish i could hug him
GAWD HE'S ADORABLE
OHMYGOOOOOOOOOD IT'S SO CUUUUUUUUUTE.
i didn't think porcupine's my sounds or were cute until now
Jesus fucking christ, why is he so cute? Omg. I can't handle it, this is just the cutest thing ever. Ajsbdjskdb
Veruca, darling, you ate before you came to the factory! O:)
this is too cute
1:25
"What the fuck"
Any lyrics?
!lol at 2:10
Ridiculously Cute!
It sounds like an Animal Crossing character, it's so cute
Can you actually pet this thing? Does it trust you enough to not prick you every time you touch it?
And when I make noises like this when I'm eating, no one thinks it's cute. Maybe I should should stop waxing?
But, Daddy, I WANT a Teddy the porcupine. I want a Teddy the porcupine NOW!
You can have a Porcupine as a pet? o.0 I guess it would make a great "Guard Dog" with those quills
sounds like Itt from the addams family
Thats cute
It is The Cheat omg!
I just don't understand what about this could make 17 people give it a thumbs down
This lady is like the crazy cat lady of the porcupine world. She's having a full conversation with this squeaky little guy!
@Killumanited i have no idea where the presumption that i'm gay came from? but also i'd love to prove to you the several instances where'd you be wrong but this is neither the time nor place, just watch the porcupine eat a pumpkin
HE's so cute!!!Wow,is he loving the pumpkin!!!
WHAT DOES THE PORCUPINE SAY.
arf. arf.
Oh my god he makes such cute noises!! at one point i heard "such fun!"
its good ! it's good ! its very good ! good good very good. its very. very very very good !! its good ! very very good very. very very very. very very very very
OH MY GOD IT IS THE CHEAT
THE MOST PRECIOUS NOISES, OH MY GOD
awwwww
THIS THING IS LITERALLY THE CHEAT
Even better at double-speed.
I don't recommend half-speed.
Super Super süß.......
I NEED IT
that was so incredibly adorable!
if you rub them front to back then you wont get hurt by the spines, although this also can happen if they feel threatened
No we just knew you were making a stupid and uneducated comment. Like the idiots who think cats can be forced to eat vegan or that sheep are killed for their wool.
Porcupines cannot eat pumpkins their stomachs do not create enough acid to break down the pumpkin particles and digest it this porcupine is probably dead by now i made this all up but you did get scared
Eeeeeeeee!!!!
No, they really don't.
oh Gawd <3 SQUEEEEE <3 <3 <3 <3
Awww so adorable
Why so cute. How?!
pokemon!
Porky Nibbler
The last "Good boy" and his reply just killed me - you go, Teddy!
They do shoot their quils.. I've seen it happen
sounds like nibler
IT SOUNDS LIKE ITS SPEAKING OUT OF A KAZOO.
THIS MAKES ME VERY VERY HAPPY.
he sounds like a kid
ikr, he'll unintentionally hurt her
Just so everyone knows those hairs on Teddy are guard hairs, beneith is a layer of nearly 40000 quills that are like sharp shallow hairs, while he looks soft the only place that is soft and safe to touch a new world porcupine is the stomach and his nose where there is no quills.  They also don't shoot their quills but they are able to brush against you and if stressed or scared will release them into skin
I work with porcupines lol these are nor.al noises and in no way fake.
I don't know a lot about poetry SPS, but I do know "slant rhyme" means an approximate rhyme, or half rhyme. "Food" and "good" are precise rhyming words. :-)
I feel bad that an animal as cute as Teddy can never curl up in bed and get the cuddle time he deserves
guys this so fake omg
*porcupine
I... Want..... A.... PORCIPINE
also they are not soft in any way, its like petting barbed wire
Ooo.. So that's how a porcupine sounds like...
Omg he either said "nomnomnom" or "fun fun!"
It sounds like somthing out of Banjo-Kazooie.
wait, so... porcupines can speak?
whoa. I learned something very important today. thanks for this amazing gift.
It might just be the quills that can pierce skin pretty easily
I love Teddy Bear videos. Thank you for sharing Teddy with the rest of us.
My whole life up until this point, I thought that porcupines had spikes like echidnas... I'm confused
Awwwwww
I swear to god it responded "I like it"
Love this animal
Teddy is fucking cute.
oh my god that is so CUTE
I WANT A PORCUPINE!!
Sounds like Thing but much cuter.
How to properly put away your decorations after Halloween
That's adorable!!! Everyone says that porcupines, hedgehogs, and echidnas are spikey, but he looks like he's just got whisker-like pines. Is he soft? Does he like being petted? x3
IF THIS VIDEO STILL EXISTS BY THE TIME I PROCREATE I WILL SHOW THIS TO MY CHILDREN
I'm not sure which porcupine is cuter--Teddy or Kemo Sabe...
at 1:16 he says pumpkin!
So cute. Omg. Thankyou for showing everyone the cute side of porkupines
Totally awesome
It's sooooooo cute!! I never what sound they made lol
Now I know where Cousin Itt's voice came from!
He responds to your voice :3 how adorable
I never knew they could be friendly ^-^
have you had him from birth?
He can talk...
he really did say "pumpkin" and "I like it". Oh my god.
OH MY GOD I NEVER KNEW PORCUPINES MADE SUCH CUTE NOISES
we may never know what the fox says, but at least we know what the porcupine says.
no, you can touch them and even pet them without getting barbed.  if you ever surprise them from behind, or touch them when they don't want, then ow.  also always touch with the grain, never against
Porcupines are suprisingly decent animals to keep as a pet (if you know what the fuck you are doing that is), I mean out of all the large exotic animals you could keep, this is probably one of the better ones
sooo cuteeee! x3 
aww :3
Its just its natural voice ya know?
The real treat is this video
C'mon, man. Don't be that guy.
im pretty sure in the porcupine language hes just saying "fuck you" over and over.
This woman is an idiot. It doesn't speak English. Pick it up, good boy. Derrp
Oh my gosh! I never knew porcupines could make noises like that! I'm in love! I want one
you win, have some internet points for the day, good sir! :) XD
OMG.im dead too cute !
never knew porcupine can get that noisy till this day...
Who is the voice for Teddy?
SO cute :)
OMG it's so cute!!!!
Sounds like a minion. I want one.
I feel like it understands.
So cute!
It's all fun and games until it goes mental and starts stabbing everything it can reach for no reason whatso ever
Who is making the cute noises?
This is so cool.  I'm amazed.
I don't understand why I've gone nearly 29 years without knowing the insane cuteness of porcupines.
"I dare you to touch me.. just ....touch me"
He sounds a little like Cousin Itt.....
2:23 "What do you think Teddy, is that as good as pumpkin pie?
2:27 "FUCK THAT
I cannot believe how adorable this is.
Don't feed the parasprites
Furries are human garbage
Had to punch a wall to feel like a man again.
Dude what even wrong with you why are you so pissed lol?
Yum yum ?.? Oh yeah lol
The twist?  She owns a helium production plant...
OH MY GOD SO CUTE  :33333 <3
Oh. My. God. The noises it made....oh my god....
Adorable
lol everyone look at the furry try to defend his sick habits
At 0:53 it actually says pumpkin lol
He is chowing down on that pumpkin
I laughed out loud. Thank you. I know what you mean
Are you sure his chat is happy?  I'm sure he would be a lot quieter if she backed up.
SO CUTE! But how do you pet or handle him?
Wow, you're right. You explained so much. I'm sorry, I should listen to the person who has a generic icon and a fan of LoL and 4chan, and brilliant musical compositions such as "Do Your Chain Hang Low" and "Bong Hits". You're clearly the pinnacle of intelligence. No wait, oops, you're human garbage.
I really needed this after watching 12 Years a Slave
permission to freak out, sir
kill it
0.55   'I like it, I like it, I like it!'
Real life Animal Crossing
"Oh my fucking god this is so good" - Teddy 2013
LOL with a furry avatar, A+
So cute
Are you fucking autistic?
I didn't know they were so vocal... that is like baby babbling, like he's mimicking the word 'pumpkin'. Amazing.
Who knew Cousin Itt liked pumpkins so much?
aww
Rhyming food with good?  Come on.  You can do better than slant rhyme.
Go ahead. Pet it. Pet it.
OK i'm dying this is, too frwejlkning CUTE!
Probably one of the cutest things I've ever seen in my life!!! Thanks for posting!
Where are his quills?
ending: "Good boy, Teddy" Ted: "Thanks!" haha
So... Will It Blend?
Alright internet, you win, you win. My cold black soul will come quietly with its hands up.
It must be frustrating to be a porcupine. He must be yelling "BACK the hell away, friend. I don't want to hurt you", but it just comes out in squeaks.
its sounds so horrible
Snooki wants smoosh smoosh!!
Hello there. We have sent a message to your YouTube inbox. It would be great if you could take a look at it and get back to us as soon as possible or email us at curator@storyful.com. Kind regards, Derek Bowler
He sounds like a Jawa.
Teddy bear..... I just love you!!! Hope you enjoyed your yummy pumpkins!!
Teddy!... There are no words to fully describe your awesomeness <3
At 0:19, I heard "Pumpkins, good."
I just love you, Teddy Bear!
more videos with subtitles please!
So Sweet :)
LOL, every time the camera gets in close..."Back off!"
I love watching Teddy eat! Thank you so much for these videos!
I think some of this, e.g. 1:15, is "You're getting too close to my pumpkin!"

He seems more fluffy than spiny. Are the spines somewhere else on him out of shot?
Sweet Teddy Bear, we do so love to watch you eat your food.
We love to hear your happy chat and how you think it's "Good!"
It's such a joy to watch you eat your pumpkins and your corn
The moment that we heard your voice we knew a star was born.
