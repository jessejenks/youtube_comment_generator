You should do a video where the teens get in groups of two, and try to make funny videos (or recreate them). Then the other groups could try not to laugh or smile at the other groups videos. Or the kids on Kids React could react to the videos, and vote on which was funniest.

I would love to see Teens or YouTubers react to korean indie music. Most of them, if not all, already know about k-pop by now and you've had videos on hip hop, so I think it's time to show another side of the korean music market. Bands like Nell, Galaxy Express, Hyukoh and so on have VERY high quality music but very little international exposure. It would make an interesting episode I think
Of course the Asian loses Nellie when the dancing
