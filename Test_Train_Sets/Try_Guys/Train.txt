Eugene is the only one that told the truth in all this
8:19 John is not amused
Question I wished they asked:
"Who do you think is the best try guy?"
Its not a toy!
God hates liars and I hate liars.... Guys intense!!
when Ned said "I don't know those babies" I almost died laughing 😂😂😂
Eugene is the best try guy . Not keith or zackh
I lied somewhere in this sentence.
it said porn diddy instead of korndiddy on cc
Hey guys💗I'm new to YouTube as I made my account today😊I have 0 subscribers at the moment, I'm not one of those scam comments looking for subscribers but I would appreciate it if you could help by subscribing or even liking this comment!😅Have a lovely day, and remember YOU are beautiful❤️
Try Guys try BTS! They should do something with BTS. I almost don't care what. I just love Bangtan too much.
"I'll kill you right here " ( never mess with John )
The old guy looked like he really didnt want to be there....
anyone nows what happend with the try guys????
Awww Ned, I have a problem controlling my volume too! It's all good xD
Keith is so cute <3
haha is this guy low-key famous?
omg he killed the babies!
this is absolutely my favourite Try Guys episode
john: "i hate liars"
dude looks like he hates everything
I actually love Keith
I like nuns... and actually a lot of them are pretty young
Why is John my spirit animal?😂😂😂
Ned: Yeah, I suppose I have a better marriage then John...I mean, he's older, and marriage's tend to get harder as people get older...
Try Guys: "Laughing and spinning around hysterically"
John: "Slowly turns head around" I'll kill you right here.
God hates laughter and I hate laughter
i l l k i l l y o u r i g h t h e r e
"I don't know those babies" - ned
LMAO!!
Ned:I don't know those babies. 
Me: dies from laughter!

Zach:do u ever want kids? 
Eugene: yea
John:he's telling the truth
Keith: wow thought u hated little kiddies?
Me: silently does from laughter!
I love them so much 😂😂😍
Do you think that you'll ever answer a yes or no question with yes or no?  well you see... 
That's me in a but shell
Who lied the most?
Ned" i dont know those babys"
Zack: Eugene, do you know how much the three of us care about you?
Eugene: No.
John: He's telling the truth.
Keith: We gotta be better about that.

That really broke my heart.
Conspiracy Theory: Zack is The Duckman (AKA Duckie from Pretty In Pink) All grown up, and still depressed that Andie chose Blane over him... 😮😉
do you kill the italian baby boat? good ned.
"i'd kill u right here."
every time u learn more about eugene u start crying and now im crying!
"I'd kill her" OMG hahhahah this guy is 100.
Thats john from ADD
I noticed they haven't been posting videos for like 3 weeks.. did I miss something that happened?
Lie detectors do not work rofl
Eugene deserves true love everyone!!!!
when eugene said he doesn't belive in true love it seriously think a little bit of my heart broke
THE TRY GUYS TRY PAINTBALL
It has been said many times that polygraph is not trustworthy
Eugene is hot.
I ADMIT I GOT A BONER AT THE MALE STRIPING VIDEO
the try guys try break dancing classes
They look like Mormons, interigating someone about the goodnews
John is amazing.
the only thing less legitimate than a polygraph is buzzfeed as a source of news
This may not be true but I heard polygraphs don't work... 
they measure sweat and heartbeat... nervous people aren't always liars
The try guys need their own channel like ladylike
I so like unjune is just like me they also only like me for my hair
Wow!
I can't be the only one who has a crush on like 100 buzzfeed employees
John is HILARIOUS.
This made my day!!! :,)
DO you think it's weird?
No
Well it is
try guys try pressure washing
I wonder which three co workers he made out with......
Johns depressing
God hates liars
he hates liars...

therefore this man is god
I got an add for the lie detector test WHILE watching this! Like you sent me an add for the video i was watching!
This is not a real polygraph. You can not move at all.
The try guys try lasertag!!!! I want to see there ninja moves!
LOL John is hilarious
i like cina town
john 🤣😂
the guys alternately: who's your favorite try guy?

me: can i say john..?
is that the lie detector guy from Nathan For You?
I just wonder how long has Zach been single 🤔
Try guys' expectations: 
fried chicken > keith's fiancee
the guy only said keiths name
"I'll kill you right here"
lmfao polygraphs are basically a pseudoscience at this point given the huge amount of variables and general likelihood of error
ugene is really cute and hot  is that weird that I like him !
''ill kill her'' hahaha old people XDD
The computer guy is so creepy
do you think u talk too much? well, when u put it that way...
Lying makes you go to hell-dan
my mum divorced twice
Well it's about heart beat and pulses so if you can control yourself you could lie to lie detector
That part when he said "I don't know those babys" 😂😂😂
I thought this was going to be boring. I couldn't stop laughing 😂
Ned looking like the grinch when he answers
they should try sky diving
N: "Eugene do you know how much the three of us care about you?"
E: "no"
Keith in the background: "damn..." 
was telling the truth
Keith in the background again: "we need to be better about that...."

My tiny cold heart just shattered Keith sounded so genuinely sorry like tell me this man isn't the sweetest most caring human being out there 😢
Zach: Do you secretly think Ned and his wife are going to get divorced someday?
Eugene: What, no. 
Ned: What? Of course he does. 

The fact that Ned is not only aware of this but is absolutely chill and unoffended by it is kinda cute? He's that secure in his relationship and/or that chill with Eugene.
Is it just me or is John creepy
I love how they all gasp when Ted says that he fakes things with his wife, and how they say "wowwww" when Keith says he would give up fried chicken forever 😂😂😂
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."

Who DOESNT hate liars?
I just took a polygraph last week for one of my labs-- it's kind of cool to see this and actually understand what is being measured and why they use those measurements. I also confirmed that even being asked a question/me answering brought on a higher heart and respiratory rate. My galvanic skin response was extremely accurate in determining if I was lying or not (which makes a lot of sense!)
"I'd kill her" ~ John
But lie detectors don't work. At all. It's pseudoscience, and bad pseudoscience at that. You can take classes on how to beat them, which don't take long. :/

http://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph.aspx
John is a god
Volume context tendency trail locate with dawn raw wind reluctant ride
"eugene, do you know how much the three of us care about you?"
"no"
"he's yelling the truth"
"dang we gotta be better than that"

that broke my heart
More try guy videos please
I wished they had asked Ned if he could save his wife or them who would he choose?
When is the next video posting???
I actually think that marriage gets better when they get older
try hair modelling
The try guys should get their iq done
why do the rest of the Try Guys think that Zach will forever be single? Zach is so cute!!! if I were old enough to be with him, I would. who else agrees with me that Zach is the adorable one in the group?
i need try guys more more and more
John is HARDCORE!
keith is the best try guy
How many guys would screw Eugene starting with me 😂😂😁
When Eugene said that divorce jacks up your brain I instantly thought yes. Yes it does.
"i'll kill you right here"

"Everything's a toy if you play with it"
Low key feel bad for John he just looked like he really didn't wanna be there
I'm with Eugene on the whole I don't believe in true love either my parents are divorced too.
Try guys try gay sex
Is anyone else scared by John
John is super scary ....... I think he is super suuupppeeerrr scccaaarryyy . Who else
John should be on the try guys, he was the funniest one
try guys go hunting
john is creepy af
Keith. You call me if and when it doesn't work out with your girlfriend.
The bad thing is that I'm with Eugene on the divorced wuestion
I mean Kieth is the favorite for the other try guys. And also "I don't know those babies"
8:13 😂😂😂😂
"Everything is a toy if you play with it"
John seems so dark and full of secrets I'm scared
I want the tryguys to play escape room like if you agree
what if john is lying 😈
"is some of it just for show"
"yeah, sure"
I FEEL ALMOST BETRAYED
Does anyone think John is a bit scary???
OK I LOVE THIS BUT DID JOHN REMIND ANYONE ELSE OF RON SWANSON???
I would not want to be hooked up to one of those machines, I would be really scared and I would be crying.😱😭
Eugene: "Would you kill the Italian baby boat, Ned?"
Ned: "Yes!"
Eugene: "Good man!"
Zach: "You psycho, don't applaud him!"
Had me laughing so much! XD
IDK WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME EVERY TIME I SEE EUGENE MY HEART EXPLODES CAUSE I LOVE HIM BUT IN THIS VIDEO I LOVE HIM EVEN MORE HE'S SO ATTRACTIVE AND MYSTERIOUS YET HONEST I'M CRYING I'M WEAK SEND HELP.
"We had to use the psychic."
Everybody Jon is god
You guys should try skateboarding
WHY ISN'T THE TRY GUYS UPLOADING ANY VIDEOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHAHAHA
A polygraph is not a lie detector, but rather an expensive toy. The polygraph measures heart beat and breathing, not lies. People can be calm and pass the polygraph test, there are even classes for it. This is video is filled with lies!
Can I get a like for john
But God doesn't hate anyone
All of them like Keith the most but he likes Zach
Omg everyone said Keath
John the sassy man! He is great.
Oh my god this is hilarious
eugiene is sooo hot
Nobody likes Nuns, Eugene
"I don't know those babies"
when will they post again?
This is kinda creep
JOHN'S SERIOUSNESS IM CRYING "IF SOMEONE'S LYING I WILL LET YOU KNOW"
No one is gonna mention "Adam ruins everything" ? i mean, he pretty much took a dump on the lie detector.
who wants to andrew to join the try guys
"We need a black member"
John: "I'd kill her."
That old guy look so angry....
Please do more guys! That was the funniest thing I've seen in months really made me laugh! You guys are amazing
This is it.

Wife's.

Ned
Keith
Eugene
And then Zack.
Sorry Zack
polygraph test don't work.....all you have to do to beat the test is to stay super chill and keep your heart rate down....criminals do it all the time..
6:47 stay with someone who looks at you like Eugene looks at Zach 😂😍❤
this is the best out of all of the buzzfeed lie detector videos
Polygraphs don't actually tell if your lying
This is literally the best YouTube video the try guys ever filmed
Anyone else immediately think of the lie detector episode of Adam Ruins Everything when they saw the title?
John:God hates liars and I hate liars
Me: WAIT, ARE U GOD THEN!!!
my ned and Ariel relationship goals are almost gone because of this video
GOD HATES LYERS, HE HATES LYERS SO THAT MEANS....






HE IS GOD!!
These lie detector dudes are so dry lol
ZACH ATTACK
When his wife's name is Ariel and yours is too
I can't take my eyes off of Eugene's hair.
Has anybody mentioned this? IT'S SO SWEET OF KEITH!!!

Zach: Do you know how much the three of us care about you?
Eugene: No.
Lie detector dude: He's telling the truth.
Keith: We have to be better at that.

So much love for this four. If you guys still make videos until you're old I will still definitely watch you guys. :(( #TryGuysFanForLyf
react to so hyang arirang alone please!!!!!!!
"I'll kill you right here.... I'll kill her."
y'all should do GISHWES! It's a scavenger hunt by Misha Collins and y'all could be a team and do all the crazy hilarious stuff. Plus your views would skyrocket cause all the supernatural fans would want to see someone do gishwhes. It would be great!
Ned looks like William Lyon Mackenzie King on the canadian 50 dollar note. Just saying.
JOHN (lie detector guy) SMILED ON 1:16
Videos like this might just save buzzfeed. 10/10 entertainment.
I love john.
Eugene is so chill about telling the world and the Try Guys about personal secrets that might as well be better off not knowing
WHY DOES NOBODY BELIEVE ZACH WILL FIND LOVE I WOULD MARRY HIM SO FAST
HOW COULD ANYONE NOT LOVE BEANIE!
No offense but John is kind of scary
Eugene is the most truthful Try Guy!

I'm not a Eugene stan by any means, but I do like that about him.
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn Ned...lookin' GOOD!
I love John
Anyone else thinking that the lie detector dude is hating them for lying a lot?
"I'll kill you right here" 😂😂😂
"God hates liars and I hate liars" Liar.
who hurt john, why is john hurt
do they upload a new video every week?
Why does Zach remind me of Jim Moriarty from Sherlock?
Loooove the setup and the dress code, the whole 'overworked cop' thing. Awesome.
okay, i get it, ned's inlove with his wife. but you kill babies? really? i mean i guess if ariel couldn't swim then it would be okay to save her because newborns naturally know how to swim since they're like swimming in the womb but i think she does know how to swim
"GOD HATES LIARS AND I HATE LIARS"
3:52 where he talks about being a child of divorce and not believing in true love it hurt my heart cause I feel the same way and I'm a child of divorce
The try guys try joking a marching band!!
The dude at the computer sounds so sad..
John is my new favorite Try Guy.
TRY GUYS TRY SKYDIVING
I will kill you right now
That guy literally dosent have a personality...
God doesn't hate liars in fact he loves liars but hates sin.
wait did Eugene fill in his eyebrows?
"Ned, you and Ariel are so cute together. is any of it just for show?". when Keith asked that Ned looked like he immediately regretted being there
Being Italian I got triggered when he said he'd kill the Italian babies XDDDD
I don't know why, but I think it would be really interesting to see them try musical theatre
Zach is adorable ❤
I need this with Ryan and Shane
I'm scared of John.
The sadness in Keith's face is priceless when zach asked "Fried chicken or Becky and he said I give up fried chicken"
After this video john went to jail for threatening Ned. I miss john...
" god hates livers and I hates liers "
So Keith begins to swear...
this was kinda awesome
Ok but real talk Eugene looks damn good in that shirt with his tie all lose
just when i thought eugene's cold-blooded attitude was just a front.. it's actually real wtf
THIS IS FKING AMAZING
i'd really like to do this just to find out if i want kids or not because honestly who knows
That dude was scary af
lmaooo "I'd kill her"
I'm sure the examiner is a crazy party guy.
This is by far the best try guys video
i love john the dude
When Eugene said he doesn't believe in true love, Zach was everybody watching the video.
took a buzzfeed break, and thank god the try guys are still here <3
oh he is sweating because hes nervous lie
"God hates liars and I hate liars." bahahaha. Best sentence in this whole damn video.
Man, seeing Eugene be so open about his insecurities makes me want to hug the doubts out of him.
"I dont need your explanations"
"Everything is a toy if you play with it", does that mean my wang is a toy?
We need to ask homophobes and crazy feminists some questions with this thing
next on the try guys, trying to figure out eugene's back story
8:33: "id kill her" IM UGJVI
same eugene, same
They should try a prostate manage
that dude is scary af
5:19 my ship has sailed
Ask questions, change your outfit, ask a new, change again and so on...
So.. how long will it be until the try guys are replaced with other men?
why is he so grumpy
this is a show about gay guys experimenting or bi curious guys trying gay acts?
try guys skydive
"I'll kill you right here" wtf dude?! I'm dying!
"I don't know those babies"
I absolutely LOVE The Try Guys! I personally think it would be great if they did an episode where they create their own origin stories where they combine elements of their own backstories with special powers/abilities they wish they had, and then act it out. The Try-vengers. Just sayin.
I love that lie detector guy!
Buzzfeed is stage 5 CANCER
lie detectors don't even work.
John is my new favorite
Every Try Guys comment section: EUUUUUGGGGGGEEEEEEENNNNNNEEEEEE
"I will kill you right here" I'M CRYING THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVER
" I don't know those baby's" 😂
"His telling the truth" more like i am groot
Try guys try band camp or marching band! Please buzzfeed I'm begging
Zach is so cute 😩😭
TRY GUYS TRY HORSE RIDING!!!!!!!
Omllllll 😂
This is the same Lie Detector Guy used in Rupaul's Drag Race (season 4). I know this by pure coincidence.
I love Keith too
Hey buzzfeed, why can't the try guys be gals?
He hates liars god hates liars is he god?
John is so creepy
Zach: Do you know how much we really care about you?
Eugene: No
Lie detector guy: He's telling the truth 
Me: crying 
Keith: we gotta be better at that
Me: more crying
eagean is so hot
This is one of the best videos I have ever randomly stumbled upon.
Guys! This is the same John that administered the lie detector test during the Frenemies episode in season 4 of Drag Race!
I'd kill her
"If you ask me a direct question, I will give you a direct answer."
"Do you like being single?"
"Well- ahhh.."
"I will kill you right now"
7:29 broke my freakin heart.
I don't need your explenations haha caught me off gaurd lmao
john is intense
these things are a total hoax scam ruins every thing explained so
Keith's "We gotta be better about that." is so honest and sweet
WTF!?(I'm Italian) I feel offended.
jonh scares me
this is gonna be the start of so many fanfics
So when is Eugene going to start his own channel?
i died when the guy on the computer said "ill kill you right now"
this is one of the best videos of Buzzfeed
I volunteer to have Eugene's babies. Nah, jk.
"I will kill you right here"
I love how there wearing suits.
The try guys ; haunted house
Yeah that was great i like being hooked up to machines lmao
John needs to be here all the time i swear 😂😂😂😂
"God hates liars. I hate liars."
"I'll kill you right here"
"I'd kill her"
"It's not a toy"
Zach: Well, I mean, anything is a toy if you play with it
I ship Zach and Eugene so hard!😍
None of this is true especially the lie of the lie detector working
Eugene: "That was great. I like being hooked up to machines."

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
John is scary
Please have the Try Guys watch a BTS music video and let them try to do the calligraphy!
"We need to be better about that" – said the others when Eugene said he doesn't know how much they care about him.


What true friendship.
Am I alone in thinking that it's adorable that Keith is everyone's favorite?
Pre teen girls dress the try guys for a week
does anyone else think this is kind of false? i mean the polygraph test has no real scientific backing, the readings from the machine are just heart rate blood pressure perspiration, etc. but none of those things are actually indicative of lying, someone could just be nervous about being interrogated and be caught by the machine. humans are complex creatures and their reaction to various things may be entirely subjective and arent actually objectively defined by anything that machine detects lol.
hey
4:31 we should have a black member quick edit lie!
it's my favorite when zach giggles...
Does the lie detector guy have any emotion? 😂
eugene. are you gay because that would be amazing lol cuz your sexy asf
Ned: would you rather save your wife, or a boat full of orphans?
John: I'll kill her.
John didn't change expression once.
The lie detector guy could survive a whole life of being a bus driver
John is my favorite try guy
"I thought you hated little kiddies" BWWHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." - Zach on life 😂😂😂
"I assume so, I don't know."
"I'll kill you right here."

"If you could save a boat of orphans or your wife which would you choose?"
"I'd kill her."
Me: dying
I don't understand why Eugene feels so insecure about himself, he's hot and funny
lying makes you go to hell
Lie detectors are not true there not 100 percent accurate.
Buzzkill John!!
He don't know them babies😂
Please have the Try guys do an escape room!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They should try bunjee jumping from a bridge. I wanna see Zach squiggle while driving there. 😂
Too bad lie detectors are pseudo-science
I was waiting for EUGENE.  He is my FAV.
"Nobody likes nuns, Eugene. I grew up catholic."- Ned 2017
Someone needs to hug Eugene. He doesnt like them i know, but still.
God hates lies and I hate lies 

Me: I figured it out he is God
Am I the only one that attracted to Eugene's veins... ? I mean... ... ...
I had to pause the video in order to like it so that I don't forget DAMN IT this is hilarious 😂😂
Eugene is most definitely a sociopath
One of the best of the try guys :)
"I thought you hated little kiddies"
I wonder usually these machine detect your heart rates and see if you lie or not so can you reverse psychology the machine so it think that you are lying but in fact you are telling the truth 
Like if someone ask me if I hate that person I will leaning to saying no to make my heart rates go high and then say yes so the machine think that I am lying but in fact I am not lying
That Pop And That Donut
eugene is such a sweetheart! we must protect him at all costs
eugene always being dark asf
Jon is a savage at the end lol
Euguine " I have many secrets " 


This man killed someone
Its been proven time and time again that lie detectors don't work a lot of the time. Even the slightest things can make it so you seem like you're lying. There have been so many people wrong fully convicted, or people not convicted, just because of a detector test. I've heard that police also know how defective the test can actually be but still chose to use it because it intimidates people.
I don't know those babies😂
"Do you know how much we care about you?" "...No" "He's telling the truth" "We gotta be better at that" </3 I'm so heartbroken. The way that Keith just,,,, he's so sad in that moment and it kills me. Eugene hunny they love you
Waiting for a "why I left BuzzFeed" video from one of them..
It's actually really easy to not get caught on these things you just have yo chill out and say it
Is Ned married?
One of the funniest videos of buzzfeed I've ever watched
Same Eugene I'm a child of divorce
"I'd cold blood murder the nuns." 
Me
Wow John seems like such a sweet person
John is a grumpy gus
they're hot in suits
WAIT!!?? WOW? ARENT LIE DETECTOR TEST A LIE ITSELF AND VERY UNRELIABLE? AND MOSTLY READ OF PEOPLES NERVOUSENESS
If you are stressed by the pressure of the lie detector, it makes it a lie because people get stressed
Why do I like watching these videos?
keith's the best <3
I love these guys and Keith is my all time favorite! (:
Try guys try roller derby!!
half expected keith to say keith was his favourite try guy tbh
"i'll kill you right here" 😂 this man needs a youtube channel, id watch it religiously 😂😂😂😂😂
The polygraph test cant tell if ur lying, the guy who made the machine said it himself
I like John.
lie detectors don't work at all lmao
please make try guys videos very frequently
they all look like the same person except the hot one
I don't like to lie
Try Guys Try Horseback Riding
They're trying to be ADD lol (they even got John)
'I'd kill her' 
Savage
By far, Eugene came up with the weirdest questions to ask 😂
2:06 Morman meeting.
i am falling in love with zach ngl
John should be on try guys🤔🤔
"Dammit, I KNEW THEY WENT SOMEWHERE!" - Ned,  2017
I love how the lie ditector dude was so calm and chill XD
Maybe you could go to Czech Republic and try Bear .There is a pub almost everywhere because Czechs drink the most bear in the world. And we make the best bear like Pilsner Urquel , Gambrinus and so on. There are so many bear manufacturers that in every shop they reserve gigantic whole section just for all the bear.
see my great videos in my channel
John looks like he hates his job.
Anyone: Do you think you'll be alone forever?

Me: Yes. No doubt. 


John: She's telling the truth
i'll show you love & care eugene. 😘
I wish they asked Eugene if he's gay
Ned:have you ever stolen anything from us
Zach: a pen
What I thought neds wife
LIE DETECTORS DON'T WORK
Can u please do the try guys try all the Australian tim tams? Or the try guys try surfing and sailing!
Itstso obvious he's just making up results for comedic results
Eugene is the Rosa Dias of The Try Guys
Eugene is not a liar
I prefer the give it a whirl fuckers
I love the way the guy on the right talks
PSA: polygraphs don't actually detect lies, they detect physiological changes in the body, such as blood pressure and heartbeat, factors that are associated with the stress behind lying. Everyone is different in their bodily reactions, so it is not an absolute answer about if they're being truthful or not. It would be more accurate to say lie detectors actually just detect emotion.
You guys should do "The Try Guys spend a day in jail!!!!"😄😄😄😄 if they'd allow that😳 lol
do they now that dousnt work you can do cordo and get lies
Hi I'm in the break up marriage life with my mom and dad!!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"
john is awesome ! 😂😂😂
you know what the try guys should do... read fanfiction about themselves. like if you agree😂
Woot this was published on my birthday
Its okay eugene im a child of divorce too and i realise they usually i cant tell How much a person actually cares about me
Love the try guys so muchhh,i want more videos of the try guys 😍
We love you John <3
i love these guys.
Maybe Eugene just want's to have sex with himself haha.  Like Carbon Copy XD
John from ADD!!!!
Eugene looks like josh dun from Twenty One Pilots........................
that guy scares me
Subjective questions are pointless in a lie detector test. Opinion is neither truth nor untruth.
Bruh John concerns me
God, I wanna see a Eugene/ Zack fanfic.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."
lmao John what
Is there any way I can subscribe to just the try guy videos? I'm subscribed to buzzfeed but I don't pay attention when they post videos because most of it is trash so I end up seeing try guy videos like a week late all the time.
John is scary when he threatens people with a staight face 'i'd kill you right there' (._.) John- 2017
Lmfao "I will kill you right here"
Keith got so sad about the possibility of giving up fried chicken!
"I'll kill you"
Do you like school?
Yes 
Telling the truth

Do you do your homework
.. Y-yes
LIES
Polygraphs aren't actually all that accurate.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars" + his face + the creepy music = I shat myself.
Why is no one commenting about Keith wanting to see how many penises he can fit in his mouth? lol
Lie detectors are such bs
John is weird
KEITH LOVES HIS FIANCE MORE THAN CHICKEN OMG I BELIEVE IN LOVE
the try guys should get there own channel
The Try Guys try Drugs.
Hitler did nothing wrong, wake up and learn the truth!
OMG I love this.  John is amazing  :)
You guys are interrogators lol
this reminded me of the Dolan Twins haha
At 1.17 You can see that John is trying really hard not to laugh, haha.
the guy who's working  the machine though😂😂
The Benny hill show
JOHN IS SO CUTE
John is also on ADD, what a traitor.
I dont like john....
the polygraph doesn't actually work. That's why it's so ridiculously we still use it
Another psudo-science reinforced by humor. No scientific explaination, just gags.
6:54 Same here Eugene :,)
john scares me
I have not laughed this hard in a long time 😂
John reminds me of Ron Swanson-
I'm seriously concerned about johns metal state
John works at all def digital too
at the end thooo ned... "well everythings a toy if you play with it" <3
ned ned ned ned ned ned is soooo cuteee...except his namee
The lie tetector guy is very very creepy
Polygraphs are completely fake
5:22 😂😂
"I'd kill the nuns" me....if I was married....forever alone
John is god
Look at Keith's face at 3:58😂😂😂😂
Zach is soo cute
I have never cringed so hard...
Everything is a toy if you play with it 😂😂
Zach and I are the same person
I'm Eugene
anyone else giggling throughout the whole video?? xD
Did any of you guys realize that The lie detector man... guy... person... person didn't laugh through any of this? XD
Can John be the new Try Guy?
Zach: do you think I'm ever going to find love?
Keith: yeah.
John: Keith is lying.
dont worrie eugene haha i wanna fuk ned haha
haahha that was lit asf xD
John is scary
Try guys- oh no Ned mentioned his wife 
Comments- Ned talks about his wife so much
Me- well he dose love her but it must get annoying 
Try guys- asks Ned about his wife almost every time
Me- 😔😔 face slap
he was on the real
Did Adam already ruin polygraph tests
I know these polygraph test are usually inaccurate but they're still fun
DO THIS AGAIN
The examiner kinda looks like my bus driver 😂😂
i want for them to ask ned if he was skared of being not the only married one
HAHA they all go WOW when Keith would give up fried chicken for his girl lol
This got me nervous.
I relate to Eugene a little too much I think
I spit out my soda
I actually hardcore ship Eugene and Zach now, whoops.
Ned looks different somehow!
This is the day I started shipping Eugene and Zach.
god hates liars and he hates liars
conclusion: he is God 
hahahhahaha :)
John:God Hates Liars,And I Hate liars...*thinks in is head "I AM GOD!!!😂😂"
Try guys should try an ice skating contest, both beauty and grace!!!
who else doesn't like John?
Hi buzfeed if you do read this then I would be happy as anything and all I just wanna say is that iam one of your number one fans and I watch all of your vid
(And on every channel ) iam not a stalker it is just that you make my day when I fell down and I hope I get to meet you which I can't becuase I live in England :((
John is my spirt animal
i am a child of divorce.
look how serious the guy was when he said "God hates liars."
I just started ROFLing halfway through...
Why is john so imitating😂
why are they called try guys?
Glad to see this being done for entertainment purposes only, but lie detectors have little to no accuracy. Most of the questions anyone can tell were lies or truths from the body language and tone of the conversation. Wishing that this piece of pseudoscience would disappear.
This is what I don't get. What if the guy doesn't know? Would the 'information" or 'pulse' be useless and unable to get anything from it?
"god hates liars and i hate liars"
THIS IS SO FUNNY
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"
squints eyes
I thoroughly enjoyed this video. I might subscribe. Actually, I think I will.
Keith looks so sad about how much he loves Becky after the chicken question
the one guy on the computer doesn't look up ONCE 😂😂
"Have you ever just hooked yourself up to one of these and just like asked yourself questions in the mirror and see what you truly believe?"

"It's not a toy" 

"Well...everything's a toy if you play with it"
John looks chronically depressed someone check on my buddy.
"Who's your favorite try guy?" 
"Keith"
"Keith"
"Keith" 
😂😂😂😂😂
"For sexual sake?" "No..." "Keith is lying." "Damnit." LOL.

You're adorable Keith. Eugene got it. AIN'T NOTHIN' WRONG WITH IT. <3
"I don't know those babies."
So is the polygraph guy god?
Actually lie detectors have been proven to be inaccurate they seriously should not be in use anymore.
So Eugene believes in ghosts but not love. ...okay. His mother was weaned on the teat of the town psychic so yeah she is potentially psychic. ...what!?! He's so A Clockwork Orange.
lmao zach's flourish with the lollipop during the fried chicken question gets me every time XD
7:30 Keith doesn't like Ned Stark?
The best teams on buzzfeed:
 Try guys
Buzzfeed unsolved investigaters.
I feel like John was actually pissed at ned for saying his marriage was better because they were young...   :I
this is such a fun video!
John is so funny XD
i really wanna try this with my friends
Keith I don't know there's a difference with being confident and being arrogant
John, a man of very few words 😂
quick question: could John have been any more miserable? XD omg that is not what he wanted to be doing lmfao
Lie detector tests aren't even real, buzzfeed cmon
I've never laughed this much watching youtube before
I'm telling your wife john!
Plz Do The Try Guys Try Swedish Candy!!!!!
Question to ask them: Are you racist assholes? Oh yeah, you dont even need a lie detector for that one, we all already know the answer to it.
Lie Detectors are just based on your heart rate going up when you are nervous about the question.
Keith IS the best Try Guy!
Ne... They should bring the Lightman Group.
ok
"Dog hates liars" -John 2017
ned:I don't know those babies
I Laugh So Hard When John Said I'm Going Kill You(Ned) Right Now! My Mind:John Is Telling The Truth
john seems like a psycho
could be gayer
Does anyone else think Zach looks like Idubbbz?
Wow, those guys have been doing videos together for 2 years.
But Eugene still doesn't know how much the three care about him?
That's really sad.
Lie detectors don't work
lie detector tests do not work, serial killers have passed them and plants have failed them
God dosnt hate liars he hates lies
the try guys try wipeout
I swear to Christ this is the same guy who conducted the lie detector tests on Flavor Of Love S1 :O
oh my god... Ned is an inch away from crying from the marriage questions
'everything is a toy, if you play with it' - The Try Guys
God hates liars, and I hate liars. Therefore, I am God.
Did you know that polygraphs don't work as lie detectors.
Keith is best try guy.
The lie detector actually doesn't look at whether or not you tell a lie or not rather it looks at your heightened galvanic skin responses, I learned that in forensics these dip shits would never know that.
John sweetie, who hurt you?
So if you could vote 1 person out of the try guys team, who would it be?
Lie detectors are inaccurate
MOST IMPORTANT COMMENT YOU'LL READ:
Eugene didn't see Ned when he asked him the question (you know the one) so 
1. It was easier to lie undetected 
2. He didn't recognize the voice or thought it was zack.
3. Eugene also prepared himself for that question to be calm and hence how he passed.

Nedgeners you can rest assured
arent nuns catholic im pretty sure they are
Eugene is the best try guy, but let's not forget it.
very very personal questions: YOU THINK YOUR BETTER THAN ME!!!
At 9:05 I thought Keith was going to say himself 😂😂 that would of been hilarious
John is by far the funniest part of this video 😂
Id honestly marry Zach
God does not hate lyers
I don't know but i like john.. hes cute :-D like his voice..
John is my favorite person now😂
"God hates liars, and I hate liars" (my face 😳😳😳)
I feel bad they're admitting this on youtube
The Lie Detectors guy FACE THOO
Is it weird that every time I see john I get scared 😳
Honestly zach was so cute in this. But then seeing the sweet side of Eugene was so cute too. And bed and neither too. This was just a really adorable video
John was the real star of the video.
Did anyone else find the lie detector guy super creepy? 😂😂😂
John was so intense, he was easily the funniest person
This is fun but in reality it's total bunk
hello fellow divorce children :,)
Awesome video! There's so many great moments here. I felt bad when they were being asked such personal questions though!
Jon is scaarryyy
John needs to be apart of the Try Guys.
keith thinks about dicks in his mouth? I guess we know who the gay try guy is now
1:10 ZACH'S GIGGLE HEHEHEHEHEHEHE
what's with the straight face dude?
John scared the SNIT OUT OF ME
"I'd kill her."



i died right there
I like John the Poligraph Engineer so much! 😀
I knew Eugene was a top.
This guy is very down to earth 😂
I like the john.
i love this so much
Haha, I am Ned. If I was in this Sanrio I would kill to hahaha
8:20
Zach replace ned for a black guy so zach is european eugen is asian keith is america not racist sorry for the offended ones
I like it how their is a professional examiner even tho a lie detector isn't proven to be effective for it to prove if a person is lying 100% the time. This is my personal opinion on this matter but I feel like we should get rid of lie detector
Everything is a toy if you play with it
                                                              -Zach 2017
I DONT KNOW THOUSE BABIES IM CRYYYYINGGGGG
This was amazing
"I'll kill you right here"
Ned is a terrible liar
John was creepy wtf
i love john lol
Hey why can't they do this in jail or in court so they know who is lying?
God doesn't hate liars he hates sin.
Omg John's face throughout the video 😂😂😂 he's legit soulless lol
"I don't know those babies"😂😂😂
Hey zach remember when you drank Ned's wine when you broke In to his hous pet being santa? I'm sorry I'm typing with one finger
I normally don't watch videos twice. Even less thrice.
God hates liars and I hate liars
John is my favorite
lol😂😂😂 at 6:35 why were they so surprised, it's chicken.
I feel like Eugene would be a good cop he seems good at interrogation and literally everything else
It's angering me how long Keith's tie is
8:20 😂 oh my god he sounded so fed up 😂
Very Personal Questions
"Hey Keith, do you like Ned's dog?"
They should've made them take truth serum, that would've been much better
John is the real  MVP of this video lol
repoio
Awww poor Zach😔😔
No! !!!!!!
is eugene gay or bi??
god bless john
"I'll kill you right here." -John.
Add john to the try guys for an episode
Ned:I feel like you know there's like a lot of shades of grey in the world 
John:I'll kill you right here
🤣😂😂
"It's not a toy" OMFG I CANT BREATHE
Cancer
Divorce does stuff to your brain is true
John is my favorite try guy
Well Keith is ACTUALLY the best try guy
god hates liars... I hate liars
Eugene in the background at 6:18, oh my gosh
the Asian looks autistic
woah John got real serious real fast
Eh, the Give-It-A-Whirl Fuckers do it better
John you're creepy but I like you
I did this with my friends they would be trying to find out if I have a crush and who it is. XD
John is goals 🙌
😂😂😂😭oh my god this is good and funny tho
I don't lie, mainly because I'm too lazy to come up with a good lie
Damn Ned is vicious and Zach is getting that Buzzfeed booty 😂😂😂
I hate Jon
Sooooo Eugene and Zack ??? I think it's sweet.
Don't need a lie detector test to tell when Ned is lying 🤥
Have to say this is one of my favourite videos on YouTube 😂
There seems to be a little tension in the Try Guys.
Zach : "if you give me a direct question, I'll give you a direct Answer"

.... Can't answer any yes or no question directly 😂😂😂
John: i hate liers 
Me: every one lies
Does that means 
You hate every one
"God hates liars, and I hate liars". What is he trying to imply
"i dont know those babies"
The job has destroyed his soul
NOT THE ITALIAN BABIES!😂
I volunteer as Eugene's baby mama.
"Eugene: Do you think you talk to much?"
Me at the bitches at school 😂😂😂😂
Okay but we can all agree that John was the star of this video
I like John. We can relate.
''I don't know those babies'' I died 😭😭
"God hates liars, I hate liars, I am god
"I don't know this babies." LMAOOIIII NOKH
I could go on all day about how polygraph tests are perceived as infallible. Truth is, even the creator of the machine was appalled by how police used the device. That being said, I can't pass up a try guys video. 🙂
Ned was the greatest
the try guys should try playing quidditch.
lol 7:36 Zach's face. just look i promise
I really want to do this with my friends...
that test doesnt work
This is officially my favorite episode in the try guys series. 😂
I'm surprised by Eugene in this the most. he told the truth the most but looked tortured by it.
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." LMFAO
i love john.
Why not the try guys try killing themselves
the guy was so serious :p
Someone give me some wood, nails, and a hammer. I'm gonna start building Zach and Eugene's ship! (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I like John😂
You guys couldn't have picked a creepier tester😂
I think we need part 2
I don't know those babies.
"I don't know those babies..." hahaha
"I dont know those babies" 😂😂😂😂😂
they should do the girls version I bet there's a lot of lies and secret😂😂😈😈
Keith should have said Keith :')
Kieth is so fugly and unfunny
8:23
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 
So is John God?
who wants a Shane Dawson\ Try Guys collab???
Hey Mr. Lie detector guy lie detectors are seudo-science and have no proof backing them
8:20
lie detector traumatized me bc i had to do it for a job interview 😭😭
Im pretty sure John is a killer He creeps me out
John is so intense omg
Does anybody else want John to have his own Youtube channel? Please, John? What would his username be? PolygraphJohn? GodHatesLiars? illkillyourightthere?
I hate Keith
I'm at a tie for Try Guy crushes now, Zac and Eugene but neither would date me so I can just dream
Maybe Eugene just wants to f himself.... he's a member of the try guys
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"

Well sir, you must be god then.
Polygraphs measure things like blood pressure, perspiration, heart rate and other bodily functions. There has been no direct clinical proof to show that those factors are effected when one is lying. Even if asked your name in a polygraph, if you're extremely nervous the machine will likely see it as a lie. That is why it is an ineffective tool as it can be easily passed if remained calm.
That guy sounds very robotic
john is my spirit animal
Zach is so cute😂
too bad lie detectors dont work.
"If see one of them lying I'll let you know, God hates liars, I hate 😡Liars".
4:53
tf that dude John is creepy af
Keith 'is' the best Try Guy; he just has 'it'. Charisma for days.
hillary clintons one of many hippocracies "lie detectors are not accurate..."i will take a lie detector"
what's with Ned going from 0 to 5000 in 2 seconds. he's got some anger or control issues; vey creepy and unsettling.
Wait, why do the Buzzfeed feminists have their own youtube channel, but not the Try Guys?
I love the Try Guys lmao
why does he sound like that (he's telling the truth)
Zach has made out with three coworkers and there are three other try guys hhhmmm
I just want this to be a series
The rate goes like this
Eugene - Best looking😍
Keith - Most likeable and nicest🤗
Ned - Most in love ❤️💗❤️
Zach - Most into Cuteness💟
everyone likes Keith  and zach was so happy he got chosen by Keith
something about John is so funny
JOHN'S SERIOUSNESS IS KILLING ME LMAO
The past few videos were not as good as I expected but this one is one of the best without a doubt
Everything is a toy if you play with it
WHERE ARE THE CAPTIONS?!
Okay let's be real, who else was like "woah this man is intense" after he said "god hates liars, and I hate liars too" cause I sure as hell did. 😲😲😲😲
I don't know those babies
LOL
"nobody likes nuns Eugene, i grew up catholic" -ned 
hes got a point, hes got a hell of a point
Ned: have you ever pictured anyone in the office naked..?
BRUH, ARE YOU NOT AWARE OF YOUR MULTIPLE VIDEOS OF YOU GUYS GETTING NAKED? THERE'S NO NEED TO PICTURE IT, IT ALREADY EXISTS😂😂
Is John secretly Ron Swanson?
Eugene is super sexy in a tie and rolled up sleeves. Like someone I know cough,cough Kookie cough,cough
the "i don't know those babies" killed me
slow head turn "I'll kill you right here." AAAAHAHAHAHA LMFAO
God hate NO ONE
Awww eugene is so depressed
God hates liars, and I hate liars.
Everything's a toy if you can play with it
i love Keith and Eugene!!!
A good try guys episode at last!! It has been a long time. I love Eugene and Zac !!!
I love Eugene, such a cool guy and I think he's kinda cute too
TELL THE TRUTH!
Even though lie detectors are a shame,
the real reason why there are so many viewers is because you want to learn how to lie in order to pass a lie detector test? You may not be a criminal, but just in case!?!?






me too!
loose lips sink ships, even your own and i am going over board before the Titanic sinks
10/10 have more John. I love him.
the try guys should try a period stimulator!! know the pain a girl goes through every month!
I lowkey think Eugene is emo
Though Eugene has the most secrets, he told the truth more so than any of the other Try Guys. He owned up to all his truths. The cold exterior is a front!
Lol, John was uncomfortablely serious "gods hates liars, and I hate liars" and "This is not a toy" aahahahaha
Just so people know a lie detector isn't always right. There is a scene in the show Lie to Me, where the head of the company explains to some people developing a hand held lie detector. That it's about as effective as holding an egg, if you were lying the egg would break, because you would start to grip it tighter. However, it wasn't very effective because people would get afraid, angry, nervous, and the egg would break despite them telling the truth. So in all, don't trust a lie detector that much, especially in a stressful/nervous/scary/tension filled/ annoyed environment.
9:44 what did Eugene say?
"everything is a toy if you play with it" 😂😂😂😂 only zach
I'll kill you right here.
Okay so, no ones gonna talk about how daddy Eugene looks in this. Like every other video/ ok.
LOL best one I've seen in awhile. They're all great together. Zach is my favourite and would like to marry him pls.
BuzzFeed: ___ is lying.
Holosexuals: THATS NOT WHAT THE FIB FINDER SAYS
God hates liars. John hates liars. JOHN IS GOD.
Literally my favorite Try Guys video
hahahaha i loved John!
Am I the only one really attracted to Zach?
quick, imagine there personalities switch
How I thought 0:29 would go:
"God hate liars and I hate liars.... I AM God."
John is my hero
God hates liars. Whole concept of religion falls apart.
how many times has this video been done?
how does anyone call eugene unattractive???
To be fair all 3 try guys besides Keith said Keith was their favorite so technically, Keith is the best try guy lol
Hahaha I laughed so hard at this xDD I wish I could try !
omg when Keith said he'd give up fried chicken for Becky mY HEART MELTED
3:04 I would have murdered the nuns too because they're going to heaven anyway. I'm not sure about Ariel though 😂
Plus I went to the catholic kindergarten and God knows how much I wanted to burn that place with the nuns locked inside of it
keith is so loved
Nooo! not Bean!!!
Why does John always say "Keith is telling the truth." with Keith but with everyone else it's "He is telling the truth."
God hates liars and I hate liars
you should make the try guys try $1 preginacy test
I laughed so hard in this video😂
Lol Ned thinks he's the best try guy and Eugene was thinking about replacing him.

Think about it. He wouldn't replace Keith cause he's most people's favourite, wouldn't replace himself cause he's Asian and not straight, and wouldn't replace Zach cause he's Jewish.
John is hardcore
still dont understand why keith has so much love, eugene and ned their the best
Zach: Do you think your more handsome than Keith?
Ned: Yes.

*in the background
Keith mouthes: f*ck you. 

IM DYING !! LMAO
OMFG JOHN IS GREAT 
"I'd kill her" 🙏🏻😭
Kill the rest of the world or your wife?



ummmmm..... BOTH
0:30 I think he's telling the truth...
zach looks so hot in this video
okay this is rlly deep towards the end
I love Ned he said would kill a boat of babys for his wife😂😭"I dont know those babys"
WHY DO I SHIP ZACH AND EUGENE?!
Too bad it's been proven that these tests are BS
this is so beautiful
is Keith gay
"God hates liars and I hate liars" -John My new motto 😂😂
Pfff this shit's hilarious! Also lotta love for Keith in this room <3
John is scary
"everything's a toy" 😏😂😂😂
Some of these questions actually caught me off guard. Keith genuinely thinking he's the funniest, Eugene wanting to replace, Ned and his Wife's persona
Team eugene <3
I love John. His straight-faced humor makes it all the more hilarious.

Not even surprised about Eugene and Zach. The UST is palpable and always has been.
At 4:56 I could tell he was lying by that no before the guy even said anything.
Is John okay?
can you please make a video try guys try parkour
Keith was so funny in this video 😂😂😂
I think Eugene is the best
"Nobody likes nuns, eugene" TRUE
Make John the new member of the Try Guys please.
"I don't know those babies"
the lie detector guy is the best part of this video....and the fact that EVERYONE loves keith
Jon was great in this 😂😂
This was one of the best try guy videos ever omg
John is scary af
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"
John is savage.
John is amazing i want him to have a show
🐢😈🐻👼🏼 who is who?
try being gay for a week lol
I don't know those babies 😂😂😂😂😂 And that dramatic music killed me
"I do lie, but only because I don't wanna hurt people's feelings." Awww...
Eugene is both physically and mentally attractive; I would love to have a conversation with him or hear him speak somewhere; so insightful.
This was hilarious
I hate to spoil this but those outfits are seriously "dope" 😉
the guy who is saying who is lying and not said God hates lyers, that's a lie because God loves everyone
Eugene needs to be protected and loved
wow the examiner is super mono tone and not happy to be there. the poor guy he probably been in business for a long time and then he has to do this.
So Keith has had penises on his mouth? my
GET EUGENES MOM TO COME ON
John reminds me of Ron Swanson
John is a fun guy.
Feel bad that ned hasn't had any good experiencences with nuns. They can be some of the kindest women, if it were not for the religious sisters that I know I don't know where I would be today.
I love john
John
Johns my new dad
John hates liers try guys
hey buzzfeed why not the try guys go to Philippines and try Pilipino things like

Games:
patintero
tumbang preso
kadang kadang

Food:
pancit
pinakbet
lechon baboy
adobo 
blood stew

places:
luneta park (rizal park) hundred islands
palawan
boracay
vigan
etc.

pilipino cultures,and etc.
Dog hates liars
"God hates liers, and I hate liers"




He is lying
Eugene says he wants kids. 

Everyone volunteers
do the haka
I love the John guy
7:38 PAUSE! LOOK AT ZACH!! LMFAOOO!!!!
They should try taking an IQ test
Aww, Zach
idk why everyone thought keith was the best try guy, my fav is Eugene. he funny as hell
Does buzzfeed realise that the polygraph test doesn't actually work?
Ned digging his own damn grave at 8:00
Everything is a toy if you play with it...
"I don't know those babies"
I don't get why anyone likes Keith the most
yikes John is creepy
You guys should do a video where you get transformed into rock stars and perform a  Rock concert. Like and comment if you agree!
The try guys go skydiving or bungee jumping
The real question is who the hell hurt John. He talked about killing people a lot.
Eugene must have trained for years
"I don't believe in true love"
"Awwww"
I love u guys
Okay so is it just me or Zach was really touchy with Eugene,i can't
I would vote Eugene as the best <3
so they're just gonna take the lie detector guy from all def digital
I <3 Zach
John was going to strangle Ned
"everythings a toy if you play with it" ahahaha!
7:33 I thought he said "ned stark" 😂😂😂
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SERIES!!!!
Why you gotta bring a god in to it.
lie detectors work on lies 50% of the time...
10:02 we know what youre really saying ;)
HAAAA KEITH IS GAY!!!!! But seriously most people would get that told as a lie because although they know in their mind their not but their body reaction,people etc. would make them nervously
All of you girls offering to give Eugene children: Do you have any clue how INCREDIBLY freaking creepy that is?
Lying makes you go to hell (where's the crafties at?)
Ned sometimes reminds me of Ned Schneebly (honestly who knows how to spell that)
I don't like John
"I'll kill u right here"

OK.......
"god hates liars, and i hate liars"
OMFG SO DAMN FUNNY HAHAHA 😂😂😂
What if Eugene wanted to screw himself and not necessarily Zach, loll.
hasn't it been proved that these tests are very inconclusive.
OKAY BUT WHO DID ZACH MAKE OUT WITH
John is now my favorite person!
Best Try Guy's video yet! 😂👏
I feel like I just have to voice how much I love Eugene. He is probably as close to perfect as humanly possible.
"You psycho, don't applaud him" I
...can't... breath...😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
guess you could call them the LIE GUYS
Damn who hurt John? 😂
I feel like the lie detector guy needs a hug
john is terrifying
7:21-7:31 My heart feels the honesty. From Eugene and Keith's response.
John is scary af
I would run if I saw him in real life
Please have the try guys pick out tattoos for each other please please please!!!!!!!!!!!!
...I like nuns
i love john from All Def Digital's videos lolol
John is my inner self
8:19 that moment when he turned around
John effing made this video from good to legendary!!!
that guy operating the lie detector machine looks like he wants to smuggle himself in his own truck, then afterwards start lying to himself while drowning himself in a tub of lies that he poured from his mouth
I would have been the most evil one and would have asked Eugene if hes ever kissed Quinta....(Oh im sure i spelled her name wrong)
I love Zach's laugh at the Keith's big mouth question.
"I dont know those babies" im dying
John sounds so depressed
Lol polygraphs don't work but this is hilarious anyway
EUGENE WANTS KIDS??????? MY BODY IS READY.
I got so scared when John said "I'll kill you right here" I thought he would've done it...
it is the guy who was eating the sucker thing
still don't know his name
that is actually for one of them
I don't know his name 
but he has glasses and darkish hair
for some of them I knew they were lying cause their faces would look weird and sometimes squashed
This is hilarious!
Do it with the girls now!
NEXT, THE TRY GUYS GET READ BY THE PSYCHIC TWINS!? pls
i dont know those babies. 
jokes
Zack and Eugene should hook up.
John made my day.
"It's not a toy."
It's like, the more videos I see them in the more obvious it is that Eugene and Zack have the lowest self esteem, Ned has the highest, and Keith is the most well rounded and likeable one.
You could tell they reeaally pissed John off. He never smiled or stuttered. He especially hates Ned because of the marriage question and in the beginning John said got hates liars, and Ned said he'd kill a boat of nuns and no one likes nuns
the try guys sort of reminds me of impractical jokers...
Let us hope that John's wife doesn't ever watch this episode
Why are all the lie detector people so moody
Zachs laugh ❤️
FUCKIN JOHN WHAT A LEGEND
Why do they all look like they are about to cry when they are caught lying?
Ned: do you believe in true love?
Eugene: no...
John: he's telling the truth.
BABY WHO HURT YOU, I WILL BE YOURS
THIS GUY IS THE BEST
"I'll kill you right here"
"I'd kill her"
"God hates liars and I hate liars"

WHO HURT THIS MAN
JOHN WHO HURT YOU
He's got sooooooo nefvous
more like "The Lie Guys"  BADUM PSHHH
😂😂😂😂😂😂
CONSPIRACY THEORY: JOHN IS A DOG
This video just made me want to hug Eugene! Always saw him as cocky and into himself because he is hot but this video changed my mind. He really needs more than people just lusting after him all the time.
Eugene is correct. Being a divorce child does do things to brains. I know because I am one.
This was one of the best videos.
John is the best 😂
The polygraph does not work. Watch the Adam ruins everything.
But like god doesn't hate anyone so technically that dude is lying does that mean he hates himself lets all give him a big hug
hahaha John is the best part! 😂
Eugene wants kids.
I've never wanted kids before this moment.
The lie detector guy represents me when I'm at school
Eugene start your own Youtube channel!!! (insert heart eyes emojis)
I'm a simple girl, I see Eugene I click.
Can Eugene just have his own Buzzfeed, like Buzzfeed E or something.
I love how the lie detector guy is always smiling
Am i the only one who doesn't really like Keith??
Can we talk about how Eugene not Keith should be known as the best Try-Guy.
Eugene: "I love being hooked up to machines"
well ok then there's a few more questions to ask with John here
I love john just how calm he his over the craziness behind him
They do need a black guy , but I think 5 ppl may be too much?
Lie detectors have proven to be in accurate, still a good video
This is the best video I have ever watched.
"I'll kill you right here".  XD
1:04 YaoiLoverOfAllKinds
lie detector tests are fake..they know that right?
I've seen this john guy like five times
I really laughed so hard😂 I can watch this for a thousand times and still laugh😂
I wouldn't mind getting interrogated by Eugene. Just saying 😘
I just want to give Eugene a big hug
John is hella scary lmao
Eugene just doesnt fit w the try guys
I'm kinda crying about Eugene a little bit... crying a little more about how much of myself I just saw in him.
"It's not a toy."
John is the type of person to get happiness out of telling a child that Santa is fake.
omg at 2:54 eugene was dying
I mean, I could've told you Eugene believes in ghosts. Jeez.
notice he always says keith always when he talks to keith but not the others
keith: is any of it just for show? 
ned: yeah, sure. 
he looked so sad OMG
this polygraph examiner is scary af
7:15 forever alone 😂
Subscribe to my channel
Do the try guys try to make cartoon sound effects... And make a short film with it
John: God hates lyers

Me: WELP IM GOING TO HELL
"It's not a toy" "anything's a toy if you play with it" XD
Just when the guy turned around and looked Zach(?) in the face when he was talking about older marriage
This was just amazing
That guy is scary..
its interesting how people think the lie test is in fact fake
that was fun! :)
"Who's your favorite Try Guy?"

Eugene: Keith
Zach: Keith
Ned: Keith
Keith: ....Keith
"I hate liars" says the person who is lying. Lie detectors don't work
Hopefully you guys know that lie detectors don't really work right?
Okay but no ones talking about the fact Zachary has made out with 3 coworkers... interesting?
"I'll kill you right here" made my day, actually my week
"I dont know those babies." 😂😂😂😂
That creepy dude has no humor
Jon is actually a cold hearted savage
"Well everything's a toy if you play with it.." IM DYING 😂 ԻՊ
2:52 the way Zach asked the question
"God hates liars and I hate liars" THIS GUY OMG
I don't think he hates people that lie
When Eugene said he believes in ghosts, I was surprised. He doesn't seem like the type. But tbh, it made him even cooler in my eyes, cuz he was so unapologetic about it. I also believe in ghosts so kinship.
I DO NOT want to meet the guy who lied to john...
He does not like liars😂😂
Asking Ned about his SO: "1000 BABIES OR YOUR WIFE?!" 
Asking Keith about his SO: "would you, like... not eat fried chicken for her?"
I had a dream last night that Ned and Ariel got divorced and I was so sad when I woke up 😭 Ned cheated on Ariel 😩
I NEED TO KNOW WHO ZACH MADE OUT WITH!!!
IM AM ABSOULOUTELY DISSAPOINTED IN EUGINE AND NED HOW DARE THEY COMPARE A BOAT OF NEW BORN ITALIAN BABIES TO A WOMAN. DISGUSTING
BEST VIDEO OF THE TRY GUYS!Who agrees?
This was just too awesome 😂😂😂 I seriously died laughing!!
Keith IS the best try guy, why does zack even bother askin?
NEVER TRUST LIE DETECTORS ITS ONLY TEC IT CAN BE LIEING TO YOU
After the personal questions Eugene looked so sad and insecure and I felt so bad
everything's a toy if you play with it.
Eugene is soooo cutw
Ok then mister JOHN
It would be really cool to see you guys try extreme sport! Maybe skydiving, snowboarding, bullriding, sumo wrestling, maybe fashion show(runway walk), bee keeping?, fly fishing, fishing for crocodiles, noodling/ catching catfish using your hands, or making wine( use feet to step on grapes to make wine), professional food eating conest, or even try guest starring/preforming circus (could dress like clowns idk), theres a million things you guys could do its crazy. I love watching these shows its awesome!!
well, now we know John is christian.... moving on...
How did he keep a straight face the whole time 😂😂
"God hates liars, I hate liars." JOHN WHO HURT YOU ??
you know polygraph tests don't actually work? right? like as long as you stay confident and you keep your heart rate down you can easily lie. hell you could even tell the truth and if you're nervous then it'll say you're lying.
"i don't know those babies." OMG Ned x)
7:32 ...  its sounds like "do you like Ned Stark " ...
1:22 in and ive learned so much about Keith
Keith IS the best Try Guy!
Eugene is so hot man
I genuinely expected keith , when asked which try guy was his favorite to say " keith "
These four have the ultimate kpop boy group dynamic
eugene looks like the 13 reasons why zack
Why is John Ron Swanson??
God hates liars and I hate liars because I am God.
This is one of my favorite videos 😂😂
I'm a child of divorce too Eugene 🤘🏽
Eugine is so ❤, but he looks broken. I just want to hug him!!!
Ned: Do you think I talk about my wife too much?
Keith: Well yea... 
Zach: Any of us could've told you that 
😂😂
i think in order of the the best try guys is Keith , Eugene & zach are equal then ned😂
Eugene is so cool
Does John laugh ????? Like he stares at the screen and says. The truth he's lying
no, it's a three 😂😂😂
Bourbon in them cups.
"God hates liars and so do I" 😂😂😂
After this the Try Guys were no longer friends.
This was super fun.
Who else thinks that they should go on a rollercoaster?!
John is my spirit animal
All Def Digital
John reminded me of Ron Swanson...
The Try Guys read Try Guy fanfiction lol
JOHN WAS ON RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE AS A LIE DETECTOR!
Try guys try to be mermaids for a day
Zach:Do you think I'm ever going to fimd true love 
Keith:Yes 
John:HES lieing
"Are you calling me a liar?"
"Well I aint calling you a truther!"

My Childhood😢😂😂😂

Nice Video by the way😂
John was so intense. Omfg.
Ned just loves his wife
Me scared of john
fun fact: lie detectors were invented by the creator of wonderwoman, who was also in a polyamorous relationship for decades. In the 50s.
keiths mouth is too big its so annoying every time i see it 😂
My job in the military required me to take a lie detector test because I had top secret clearance.
Zach was so cute in this video. His laughter was so infectious!
10:17 zach :"well every thing is a toy if u play with it "     WELL THATS WHAT SHE SAID
I got my molar removed yesterday, it's extremely painful to laugh/smile, I am in so much pain after watching this
"Do you think I would be a good husband?" Eugene's dying of laughter in the background
The lie detector guy is killing me
Keith: Have you ever wanted to f*ck one of us?Eugene: NoJohn:He's lying Eugene's thought(I would f*ck all of you)
This whole thing was so uncomfortable
I have to say Keith is my favourite 😂😂😂
GOD HATES LIERS, and i HaTE liers!!!!!! JoHn RaGEs QuiEtLY
Ned you're the worst at lying, I didn't even need to hear John's response to know you were lying haha
JOHN, MY MAN
This was hilarious! and informative... and a bit sad when Eugene said he didn't know how much the others care for him.
I don't know those babies
"Eugene do you think that's weird?" "No." "Well it is." 😂😂
Eugene would make really cute babies
I think it's so funny when John says:"He's telling the truth or he's lying."😂😂
dammit john
Eugene is so hot
(When Eugene told the truth about not believing in true love)

Zach: Awww!
John was amazing.
Hes telling the truth hahahaahaha
only reason ned wouldnt kill her yet is because he hasnt been married as long as john has. lol
"Well that was great, I like being hooked up to machines"
"I don't know those babies" BYE
"everything's a toy if you play with it." lol zach
god hates liars, and i hate liars LMAO
Fun fact: Psychology tells us that polygraphs do not work because of the the subject can manipulate the experiment (knowingly or unknowingly) because they are aware of the purpose of the polygraph. This is called subject bias!
Polygraphs dont even work
He is telling the truth
This is what I imagine a girls slumber party true or false conversation to be like
Lie detectors are not reliable.
I'm a simple girl. I see Eugene in the thumbnail, I click.
This is so funny
The Try guys go to a haunted house, please make it happen !!
I want to give Eugene a hug in all the Try Guys' videos (it's kind of a given). But I especially want to give him a hug in this one. I completely relate to that dude.
John is terrifying
This video is #44 on trending!!!!
Zach's laugh though 😍
Keith saying "we gotta be better about that" is why he's the favorite try guy ❤️
I am laughing so hard
John from Nathan for you
I don't know those babies
Buzz Feed full of Betas ...
John kinda scares me tbh
This was one of my favorites of the try guys!
lmfao!
"I'll kill you right here" john 2017 😂😂
omg i love john
I don't know what I love more, that Keith is the most honest of the bunch or that Zach has been outed for hooking up with so many coworkers
John is just so chill
The   Drfougtogbuugb
Would have been a great opportunity for Kieth to come out of the closet
Eugene and Zack is my new fav ship.
Polygraphs are nonsense, though
lol polygraphs only work 50 percent of the time
"I don't know these babies." IM INT EA RS
"i don't know those babies" lmfaoooooo
No offense but lie detectors are so outdated like people can easily bypass them by using drugs to calm their heart etc and they are easy to fail if you're just generally stressed out about everything and anxious even if you're telling the truth
Zach would make a great politician
"I'll kill you right here" -jhon
It's literally so scary that you see the parallels (?) as when they made a video about like the alpha man and a dominant one.. wow
find a guy who would sacrifice a bus full of nuns and a boat full of Italian babies just to save you. #relationshipgoals
Eugene has me shook on his hair
0:31 Shut up dude, you lied to your wife just the other day.
we need more of john!!!!
I'd honestly love to see The Try Guys try Parkour and/or Free Running!!
Eugene and Keith need to make a gay porn with Zack, and Ned can watch.
While everyone is talking abt Eugene's or Keith's answer or even John's I'll kill you right here statement, I'm just here literally freaking out abt how Ned said tht some of his cute moments with Ariel were just for the show... 😭
the guy is really serious
Damn, it's like... Eugene would treat me so wrong, but oh so right
if I was asked if I would give up roasted chicken for the rest of my life or not marrying my fiance, i would still be engaged for the REST of my life. my English is awful. adobo
Lie detector its not working...its just a placebo effect
Eugene looks like the Korean version of my native boyfriend wtf 😂😂
Lie detectors are unreliable because it detects sweat and how nervous u r but people could be telling the truth but are nervous the are shown as lies
When Ned pauses for long you know he is lying
Zach:Keith do you think ill ever find love
Keith:Yah!
John:Hes lying 
Zach: Dammit Keith 
Me*:LAUGHING THEN THROWS PHONE ON FLOOR BY ACCIDENT* 
LOL
uuuuuuuuhm they could've asked better Qs! like has Eugene ever fucked Kelsey! or if he's really gay!
Can I please get one like?My birthday is tommorow:-)
Awww their friendship is the sweetest
I started watching the try guys cause of Eugene, I think I like him even more now ♡♡♡
god hates liars and I hate liars
I dont know those babies
literally all i care about in this life is eugene <3 <3 like, i relate so hard to so much about him. the honesty in these moments, the painful truths, the pretty wide breadth of self awareness, and of the fear of introspection while simultaneously knowing it exists and has to be done for things to get better. eugene, if you ever read this, know that i see you in so many of these vids being honest about discomfort and fear, and being vulnerable and i think that is fucking amazing. for me, one of the most rewarding things about watching try guy videos. so so SO much love for you, eugene. <3
Does anyone get the ad bout that ostrich...
"God hates liars and I hate liars"
HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS CUTE BEANIE
Neds hair is looking gooood!
They should do this more
Bonus Question : Eugene are you gay????? ...
God didn't like liers he forgives
John is my Suger daddy
Why don't they use these in court? ( i know i can google it but I prefer the YouTube community response)
JOHN IS BEST TRY GUY
Damn, that guy John is pretty fuckin intense!
I had a dream about Eugene, he was walking around in public naked with these other people...
again p l s
"Everything's a toy if you play with it"
Jon is not having it
"Do you kill the Italian baby boat, Ned?"
Oh Ned's Catholic. Good to know.
"I don't know those babies" XD
My name is Jafar
I come from afar
There is a bomb in my car
Allahu akbar
This was damn interesting... need to do with my whole co-worker to tell them indirectly how much I hate them..
Who hurt john??? My gods 😂
I'd marry Zach 😂
John on ADD too
I need a polygraph test just to know how far in denial I am
So if you have anxiety disorder, most of the things you say would be read as lies?
"God hates liars, And I hate liars." God damn bro.
That man who's testing them means business
did anyone else think keith was gonna answer "keith" when he was asked who his favorite try guy was?? 😂😂😂
"I don't know those babies"  I am deceased 😂
THIS IS MY FAVORITE TRY GUY VIDEO
"Eugene, do you know how much the rest of us care about you?"
"No"
"We've gotta be better about that"
Okay but this is so cute??
kieth is troutty mouth. like if you get the refrence
*ZACH asks Ned*: DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE THAN JOHN?!
Ned: Well, I don't know... I guess...*starts rambling because he's nervous* well, he's older and marriages get worse...
JOHN: I'LL KILL YOU RIGHT NOW!!!!
"My mother was weaned on the teat of the town psychic" WHY HAS NO ONE ELSE MENTIONED THIS WHAT THE HECK EUGENE
ZACH to Keith: Do you think I'll ever find love? OwO
KEITH: thinks about answer ...yeah!
JOHN: HE LIEING 
Zach walks away in disappointment
Keith acts surprised 😳
😂 😂 😂 😂
I can't tell if John was being sarcastic or if he's just no fun
Wow just wow this was hilarious
Ned is my favorite try guy
4:30
4:57
5:27
I want to know😑😂.
I LOST IT when he said "God hates liars, and I hate liars" LMFAO hilarious. P.S. Zach, I will marry you.
Too bad polygraphs are fake. They detect heart rate, sweat, nervousness, etc. so if your just nervous it will detect that your "lying" even if your not. They were only made to scare criminals. Back in the 1700's/1800s they used to make "criminals" hold hot iron rods and if they "lied" it would burn them. Many criminals have actually managed to "pass" the lie detector test by remaining calm. They actually have college classes that teach you how to beat a polygraph test.
Just you you all know, polygraph tests an be very inaccurate, for example, a man once did a polygraph test on a plant and concluded that plants could feel emotions. Also, a few criminals have passed the polygraph test because they weren't nervous about answering, they were just laid back.
LOVED IT!!!!!!!!
I have built a ship 
Zugene 
Zach 
&
Eugene
lol
if you like this comment I will subscribe to your youtube channel
Ned is the best Try Guy
Everything's a toy if you play with it
hey Johns from All Def Digital
imagine being those coworkers zach's kissed 😂😂
I love when they all giggle in the background
Eugene is a child of divorce,  doesn't believe in love, and doesn't know how much they care about him. Breaks my heart!
John: I will kill you right here.
@ 4:19 when the guy tells them Eugene is telling the truth 😂💀 he's like seriously?
You guys should attempt to try to play instruments I believe it will be fun
well john is friendly :)
John is Savage
The try guys should have their own channel
They stole John from ADD!!! 😂
Lie detectors don't actually work they only say if you are telling a lie or not by your heart rate
There goes Eugene again talking about not being attractive.....

but he issssssss
this was funny.
Ned has become so scary now. Like he would literally start a zombie apocalypse if that means saving his wife 😂
"God hates liars" did anyone else go 'well he fu*king hates me 😂😂
'John would you save the orphans or save your wife?"

"kill my wife"
Dear The Try Guys, will you guys try to prom with me?
John can't be for real, that has to be a character
right?
fyi, lie detectors don't work. #1 people that go to jail sometimes, didn't do anything. #2 lie detectors are basically seeing if your lying by reading your nerves, so like if you get nervous it would be shown as a lie. #3 75% of the time the lie detector is wrong..
About the beginning - God doesn't hate liars; he loves everyone because he created everyone.
i'm very concerned about John
Zach Do you like Ned's dog? 
Ned WHAT? 
Keith No, I just don't like dog 
John He's telling the truth 
Ned Do you like Eugene's dog 
Keith Actually I do XD 
John He's telling the truth 
😂😂😂😂
The guy is so intense.
John is great 👍
The Try Guys should try doing silk!
do the try guys try bleach
Eugene I think he is gay sometimes I mean I don't have a problem with it but he just kind of goes off that vibe
I really see Eugene as Sirius, especially when he said he didn't know how much they cared about him
I'm a devorse baby Eugene,ur not alone
thats the dude from add
These types of test don't work. If they get nervous or sexually aroused, it changes the answers. Get a person that professionally detects lies.
Did Eugene lie even once?? I don't think he did. Or maybe he's good at staying calm while lying......
"I'll kill you right here" 😂 8:19
John is also part of the kkk hahahha
lol I thought he said dogs hate liars, I hate liars I was like wow. That's so sweet.
more like the LIE GUYS!! Eh eh? 








Ok I'll leave now...
"It's not a toy" hahaha Wow buzzfeed actually made an entertaining video lol.
"Everything's a toy if you play with it"
I love how John has no facial expression through the whole thing
When John is actually the best thing about a Try Guys video
"I'll kill you right now"
"I'd kill her"
Needs to hire John for my birthday!
You can tell by the body language whether they're lying or telling the truth. :)
polygraphs can be fooled
When he said "I'll kill you right here" I died 😂
omg Keith would give up fried chicken.
john looks a bit scary
I keep assuming Zach is gay even though I know he isn't. I've read way too many malec fanfics.
John was scary
Can I hug Eugene pls
Let the girls take the test!
Jesus loves everyone
i honestly don't know how anyone could, not believe in true love. i just don't understand.




could someone explain?
i am eugene, eugene is me
eugenes "and thats super gross" sounds fake as hell
John is god basically because he said God hates liers and he hates liers SO godseption
If Keith would give up fried chicken, he's gonna marry Becky
I'm t
alian
I thought Keith was going to say Keith as his favorite of the try guys 😁
"We don't need to hear your explanation"
Why does eugene look extra Chinese in this video😂😂😂
So... is John God?
why is john so depressed
Anyone: Do you think you'll be alone forever?

Me: Yes. No doubt. 


John: He's telling the truth.
John is seriously creepy with the music and the zoom in.
"I don't know those babies" 😭😭😂
Man do I identify with Eugene's answers omg.
John seriously needs to watch something funny.
Eugene... you hair is beautiful but nothing beats you eyes and smile! ;)
Love you guys!!! <3
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 
Me: is that a lie?
Zach I totally agree about question complexity. Most answers are more than yes or no! There's always more to say.
can i rent john?
I just came here to say that Eugene is so sexy/gorgeous
why Eugene always in the back just shady af??
John needs a hug lol.
John looks like he hates his life..
Eugene: So that was fun...I like been hooked up to machines 

😂😂
"I don't know those babies." I DIED!
HAHAHA
ANY TIME
The Lie Guys
"I don't know those babies" 😂😂I died when he said that lmao
3:55 dang it
I like Eugene the best
I SAW EUGENE AT COACHELLA
"I don't know those babies."
Please, I need a Part 2 of this. At least.
I love Eugene
Everyone in the comments: 'Oh man, it's gonna be so clever when I quote the video 😂😂'
Zach looks sexy in the white shirt, the tie, the lollipop is a nice touch
Buzz fraud #trumplicans
JOHN HAS NO CHILL
to be honest john is kinda creepy
Lie detectors don't work
CAN WE DO THIS ON WORTH•IT? I wanna know if the food is as good as they say it is
Keith is so funny when he is asking the others questions
The lie detector test is a lie in itself. It doesn't even work...
And now, guess who ships Zach and Eugene? 😂😂😂
" God hates liars and I hate liars " he is so scary 😂😂
buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzfeed seems popular. sorry, i like typing the word buzz, lol.
I almost stopped watching when the guy said "God hates liars" lmao
They should try the ouijia (how ever you spell it) board
You could have asked me these questions about them and I could have told you the same answers 😂
I missed them so much omg buzzfeed isn't the same without them and john is my spirit animal.
How does Eugene get his hair like that??
I love how one of the guys Said he Would rather kill a boat full of babies than his wife and the other guys just said ok but when another guy said that he would rather give up fried chicken to Mary his up coming wife they said WAUW!!!!
lie detector tests dont work. so...
...But lie detector tests are fake and don't work?
IS NO ONE GOING TO MENTION NED AND ARIEL'S JUST FOR SHOW PART?
Omg when Ned said the thing about jhon I was freaking cracking up then he said he would kill his ehife
Eugene's answers make me very, very worried for him...
"God hates liars and I hate liars... therefore I am god"
Eugene's answers are seriously concerning...
Should be called an Anxiety Test.
this is the only buzz cancer video I like
lie detector tests like this are BS because it goes by pulse, and blood pressure. any kind of stress can mess it up. period
when you recognize John the polygraph examiner from All Def Digital 😂💀
This was as bad video to watch while doing eyeliner
Self confidence is great, but Keith definitely is extremely arrogant.
The polygraph is highly inaccurate.
I don't think anyone from the UK realised that the Alton towers THEM tune started play half way through it😂
A polygraph is not a lie detector test it just takes you pulse and other body functions. You can tell if the person is nervous by their pulse but it's not 100% accurate. It's also ironic how the guy says he hates liars but yeah he's lying that a polygraph is a lie detector test. Glad you guys had fun with it! Not Trying to be a hater!
When they were like would you replace any of the try guys, and he said yes. And was like "We should have a black guy." I was dying laughing. I think then it would just look like Male Bratz IRL lol
zach is nygma from gothem
Damn, I have so many questions. We need to get Eugene's backstory!
He only says Keith's name! "Keith is telling the truth"
I only like Kieth and Ned
John is my spirit animal :D
I just came here to dislike because buzzfeed.
7:18 best moment HAHAHA
John scares me
Need and Eugene are the most stylish
Somehow need still managed to fit his wife in
Poor Eugene💙💙
Lie detector tests are complete BS. Good for a laugh and that's it :-) So many other factors can be taken into account for. Health conditions and stress. An honest person may be nervous when answering truthfully and a dishonest person may be non-anxious.Serial killers have beaten these things easily.
Keith at 8:14
"I like being hooked up to machine's" - Eugene 

I'm dying 😅😂
John from ADD
WAS THIS DUDE IN SEASON 4 OF DRAG RACE
These guys seem gay.
Lie detectors don't work, it's been proven multiple times.
Who is Eugene dating?
You guys are all the best!
"Do Lie Detectors Work? Calling it a “lie-detector” suggests that a polygraph machine can detect lies. Commonly used in criminal investigations, this device actually measures nervous excitement. It operates on the premise that if a person is telling the truth they will remain calm."... just saying
"I don't know those babies"
I don't trust lie detectors, but this was fun to watch
When does Ned ask Zach if he ever pictured anybody naked?
you don't need a lie detector machine if you have a bracelet from your missing mom... :)
Wait, wasn't the polygraph debunked by the inventor of the polygraph?
That guy in the corner just saying hes lying hes telling the truth am i the only one who finds it funny
"Nobody likes nuns, I grew up Catholic"😂😂😂😂
I don't know those babies!
"I'll kill you right now."








Me: Square up
9:20 "He's telling the truth" when he saying that it sounds like he's surprised! Ha ha ha
GOD HATES LIARS AND I HATE LIARS
when john said "I'll kill her" about his wife and the kids it got me weak
The lie detector guy was so creepy
I was losing interest in these guys with some of their recent moves on the internet, but this vid brought me back.
Can we have that older gentleman be the next addition to the try guys I like his dark sense of humor
What is the point of lying while durng a lie detector test???
Polygraph test is just a scam even the inventor of the polygraph test don't believe it works.
Zach is so cute omg
You guys know lie detectors don't actually work right?
lie detectors are pretty much inaccurate and have been disproven
"I don't know those babies."
Fuckin John passes the edgy test XD
"everything is a toy when u play with it " XD
:)
Damn Adam Conover would be disappointed
Lie detectors don't work xD
the try guys drop acid
"God hates liars"

"I hate liars"



DIES
This is funnier because of Zach eating a sucker.
Can you get John to be a Try Guy? I feel like he's the kind of diversity you need at Buzzfeed.
PLLLEEEAAASSSSEE DO HORSE RIDING!!!
John the lie detector guy is amazing. He's either really good at not breaking character, or really is a psychopath. Either way, made a great vid! lol
Johns got a thing for killing
that was really funny
Eugene actually kinda look like Jay Chou or Vanes Wu
Make it a series! Best video I saw today and I watch like way too many.
"He's Telling The Truth".....
I think I laughed more on this one than any other of their videos.
Ned looks so scary sometimes...
Wtf that robot saying "he's lying" or "he's telling the truth"
John reminds me of Ron Swanson.
John Swanson
Eugene is smokin hot #asalways
Really wanting the try guys to come to vidcon Australia!
My fave try guys: keith and eugene. Very genuine! Love love love!!!
Adam has already ruined this :P
John is some savage huh?
i'm special
Lying makes you go to hell...
xDDDD
"I like being hooked up to a machine" (Eugene)
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" (Zac)
I love nuns
Eugene wants children..? IM HERE HELLO
Eugene is beautiful
I am Ned
Too bad they dont work
"do you think im ever gonna find love?"
"yea"
"keith is lying"
"Do you like working for BuzzFeed?"

Everyone: Yes

machine explodes
We need more try guys
Hello to the people who read this!....Have a great day!
Also, wanna hear a story?...I found this on reddit :D...

                                                  The Story Of The Caller
DISCLAIMER-THIS IS SORTA SCARY (FOR ME) SO PLZ DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANNA BE CREEPED)

My mum was sat down, On her phone in the living room. The telephone rang so i ran and picked up as my mum was sat down enjoying her programmes. I heard a voice saying 'Heh-lohhh..'   The voice was deep...Like the horror films. 
I replied 'Hello?'
'Can I speak to Mrs_______(mums name)' he said and the he let out a creepy laugh... I looked at my mum and she straight away knew that the phone was for her. She started gesturing to me to say to the person she is not home as there is always usually some annoying seller.
'Uh, she is not at home...Could i please hang up?'

He groaned 0-0 and said 'Awh, u little rat!'
I said 'Me?.....'
'JUST SHUT UP OR IM GOING TO COME AND KNOCK ON UR DOOR! I KNOW WHERE U LIVE!' he shouted
I said 'Where?!'
He just hung up....I couldnt go to sleep but my mum said its probz a prank call.

TY FOR READING AND PLZ CHECK MY CHANNEL OUT ;D    Bye!!!!
Petition to have John become a permanent Try Guy??
John is intense lol
Lies are the glue that holds society together
Polygraphs are actually super bad at detecting lies but it's a fun video! We just shouldn't put all our faith in this kind of machine.
Does Zach and Eugene are gay??
But god isn't or never was real?
As cute and funny as this is, research has shown polygraphs aren't actually that reliable as a method of lie detection
"God hates liars and I hate liars." 😂
I love John XD
I love Ned😂
Lie detectors are outdated everyone knows they don't work 100%
that guy was up for no banter it was really awkward 😂
who hurt john
that john guy seems kinda scary lol
John is... very intimidating
I like John a lot tbh
Almost all Asians parents are divorce. Including me..
Hey! Can anyone give French or English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing, PLEASE?
i'm john
So is Keith gay?
John seems hard af haha God doesn't hate liars, he hates lies. love the sinner hate the sin
I feel like Eugene needs a hug when he said he said no to knowing the try guys cares about him 😭😭 ILL SHOWER U WITH LOVE IF I HAVE TO EUGENE
If you're catholic, Ned why would you hate nuns?
The polygraph is an out dated method of interigation that can be easily tricked
Everyone looks so handsome in their white button-ups and ties! @ A @
It has been proven by many credible sources and PhD's that a polygraph is only 10% - 20% (TRULY) accurate! Look it up. Do the research. This information is ( shocking, scary, and very true) correct!!!
Eugene made me cry so much 😭
this is all the guy says he telling the truth hes liaring
John reminds me a bit of Ron from Parks and Rec
hes telling the truth
god hates liars, john hates liars. therefore, john is god
Every video I watch that causes them to open up more, I get more determined to marry Eugene.
No offence to John, but if a man who looks that tough said he'd kill me right now, I would be terrified. XD Hahaha.
This was interesting!
Try Guys try to DIY dare!!
BLACK MEMBER!
Polygraph doesn't even work FUCKTARDS
this is one of the best videos buzzfeed has uploaded in a while
Give John a Snickers goddamn 😂
eugene - THATS WHY HIS HAIRS SO BIG. it's full of secrets
I don't believe the lie detector don't lie, he do lies, he just lied to us all
Aren't lie detectors pseudoscience and not accurate at all?
God doesn't hate liars. He hates lies. Hate the action, not the person.. if God hated liars and other sinners, then don't you think Jesus would never hang out with tax collectors and prostitutes?
ned is the best😂😂
7:31 DO YOU LIKE NED STARK
New favorite buzzfeed video 😂 I laughed so hard at some of these questions
Is it just me who thinks they all look like jack from fight club when they are warning black ties and holding coffee! 😂
Eugene totally ripped my heart out of my chest. It's not just the fact he doesn't believe in true love... I do not either. But just in the "couple-way". What about family and friends? There is the place where you can find true love. Hold it and believe it. The erected wall maybe protects people from their insecurities but also from the love itself. And that's a shame...
When John said he'd kill his wife I died 😂😂😂😂
eugene should do a hair tutorial
the john guy was scary af he was like ''god hates liars i hate liars''
I thought these were bullcheese.
hey it's Eugene from the try guys, Welcome to your tape
JOHN IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL
"god hates liars, and I hate liars"
This is actually really sad.
I think I fell in love with John:D
Omf John, I can't tell if he joked once in this video but this man can keep a straight face
man this is brutal lol
I love Eugene!!!!!!!!!!! seriously!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."
- Serious face -
Me: - shrinks away -  "Damn."
lets get this straight, the examiner is terrifying
This is my favorite
Omg me and eugine are the same 
1. divosred parents 
2. Korean-Americain
"I'd kill her." -John, with a straight face, talking about his wife
Lie detectors do not work PEROID
The best part about the whole video is that I don't know if John is being serious or if it's just an act
Three discriptions about John:

1. He doesn't display any emotion
2. He always sounds like he's chewing something while talking
3. He sounds like a robot, saying things in the exact same tone every time he talks

EDIT: WHAT THIS COMMENT HAS 830 LIKES??
wow how did they get Ron Swanson to conduct this test
Why are they promoting archaic and repeatedly debunked trash as though it were even relatively accurate? All that matters is how you physically react, if you get excited or stay calm, not what you're actually thinking about.
"I don't know those babies"
Obligatory polygraph tests are inaccurate comment... http://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph.aspx 
(American Psychological Association)
That awkward silence where he said his marriage was better then Johns 😂
Then johns reply to the orphans or your wife. I'm done 😂
I died when john turned his head
keith really loves becky his fiancee😍
John is the best dude ever
"god hates liars, and i hate liars." god dammit it sounds like my mom
god hates lier and I hate lier . wow 🔥
This is the most toned-down I've ever seen Keith and Ned.
This is it. I've come to a conclusion. I'm in love with Eugene
I believe the Friendship DNA test revealed that Zach and Eugene would be the most compatible for hot sex, was it? So it's true eh Eugene? ;)
that thing doesn't even work 😂
John is wild
Does anyone else feel like there's gonna be a bunch of uncomfortable Eugene and zach fan art now?
"do you think i'd make a good husband?" maKES ME SO SOFt #ProtectZach2k17
1. John is apparently the only polygraph tester in all of television land
2. I question the validity of this test, because with all dat Azz who wouldn't want to fck Ned?
I don't know those babies
4:20 way to dogg on his family culture
All of them looked so neat in this video. New hair cuts. Ties. Really nice.
so fake
When the asked which Try Guy Keith liked the most I really wanted him to say "Keith".
God hates lies and god hates me
This was a really fun episode :)
I loved this please make more
John is my spirit animal
"idk those babies"
They should use a lie detector in trials
love you I keith
John "I will kill you right here"
JOHN IS SO CREEPY BUT SOOOO RELATABLE
Lie detectors are not accurate.
I want John to be my uncle I get left alone with in the living room while dinner is getting prepared.
The dude that runs the machine is intense
Keith
Anyone else get weirded out when the poly guy said his intro 😶🤔
Keith is the best
EUGENE WITH HIS SLEEVES ROLLED THO
"God doesn't like liars and i don't like liars"
where can we go to do this? how much is it ? anyone know?
i don't know those babies
by far my favorite try guys video ever
John = God
Why is the guy always like"Keith is telling the truth" and for the rest of them he says "He's telling the truth"
zach: do u ever want children
eugene: yes
john: he's telling the truth
keith: awww i thot u hate those kiddies

I CANT HANDLE THIS EUGENE IS ACTUALLY SOFT IN THE INSIDE
#johnjoinsthetryguys
There reactions in the background make this extra fantastic
"i dont know those babies"
the way he says "everyone knows you like fried chicken" at 6:30 😂
Eugene's face is looking so chiseled and nice in this video wow. I mean it always is but more so than usual
Everyone knows Keith is the best, even Keith!
The tester dude is scary
John is me
thing is lie detectors aren't that reliable
all these dark sides of Eugene
Guys do u rebember there take on survival i wish they can do it again but with everyone there!
Now I really ship Eugene and Zach
John seemed so unenthusiastic and like he didn't want to be there
when Zach said "Everything's a toy if u play with it" I think I found my new life motto
Wow, the more I learn about Eugene the more sympathy I feel for him. He had a tough childhood and is insecure even though he acts like he is the best and knows he is loved and handsome. I know everyone's mentioned it, but when Eugene said he didn't know how much the Try Guys cared about him my heart broke. :'(
Why did they ask Eugene if he wanted to f**k them? lyk is he gay?! Is this the confirmation we've been looking for?
this is bull,the polygraph is highly unreliable. anyone can pass it,all it takes is a lack of conscience,Gary Ridgway the green river killer passed a polygraph,O.J simpson passed a polygraph, along with some others...so this so called test,means absolutely nothing,yet in some states they can use it to establish probable cause for further legal measures
John is scurry
Do this again!
okay but can we talk about how Eugene doesn't believe in true love??
"He's telling the truth"
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 😂😂
My perspective of Ned went from 0-100 real quick
Keith is the best try guy
John is a westboro baptist church member I feel lol
Eugene is so hot in this video.
To me some of them seem so sad sometimes.
Like Eugene and Keith..
0:30 LYING MAKES YOU GO TO HELL
What about Try Guys Try Extream sports or rock climbing
😂😂😂"I'll kill you right here right now"
John looks over
"I'll kill you right here"
John, you are my hero.
John is evil!
why is john me
That was their funniest!!!!
Ned is a terrible liar
"Do you ever want children?"
"Yes"
I VOLUNTEER
Make John a try guy.
7:23 I felt you eugene!!!! cos we're INTJ squad!!
"God hates liars." What an ignorant statement...
When Eugene said he genuinely didnt believe in true love I got so sad!
Why is John so serious? Not to mention he sounds so monotone 😂
I have 2 favorites Keith and Eugene
Lie detectors are inaccurate...
Did... John just lowkey imply he was... god???
"ill kill you right here" -John
this line is the one line john said to him when he died
Zach is dan today
John is a savage
This is so entertaining
John is psychopathic I love it
"I'll kill you right here"
Zac and Ned are my favorite :)
It turned out very weird at around half way through the video
I was waiting for the staff to break out into laughter after that "god hates liars, and so do I" but it just cut to the title screen and I was like "....well okay then"
I relate SO MUCH to Eugene.
PROTECT EUGENE AT ALL COSTS
THIS VIDEO MADE ME BOTH HAPPY AND SAD THE ENTIRE TIME LOL
john scares me
He looked so damn depressed
Isn't this the same lie detector guy from Nathan for You?
I think we learned the most about Eugene here, and the heartache is real for his unknowingness of the love the Try Guys have for him.
Too bad that lie detector dosn't work :)
Do you believe in true love? No. (truth) 5 min later I believe in your love!
Someone please make a fan fiction of Zach and Eugene
"I don't know those babies" lmaooo😂😂😂
" I don't know those babies " 😂
I love Eugene and the emo lie detector guy
"I'd kill her"
"God hates liars and I hate liars" HAHAH I LOVE HIM
"Do you like Engine's Dogs?" Yeah I do like Engine's Dog"
He's so intimidating jeez 😂
I think Eugene is the best try guy XD
Actually God loves the sinner but hates the sin (lie)
Polygraphs. Don't. Work.
I ' l l  k i l l  y o u  r i g h t  h e r e
God zaxk is so freaking cute!!!!! I love his reactions
"God hates liers, and I hate liers." Eye roll.
THIS NEED TO BE LONGER OR HAVE MORE PARTS
I don't know wtf it was but when Eugene said no when they asked if he knows how much they care abt him I literally teared up
The dectector guy was so serious
john scares me... also love how deep and srs things got!
john is my fav now he should have his own channel
I thought Kieth was going to say that Kieth was his favorite try guy
Everyone loves Keith <3
FEH BOY!!!
Part 2 to this
I've seen John everywhere
Damn john so serious.
"I'll kill you right here."
Zach reminds me of murr from the impractical jokers 😱
This. This video has made me laugh the most ever from a buzzfeed video.
Zach looked so innocent as the goes "do you think I'd make a good husband?"
Is Eugene a Capricorn?
I grew up Catholic 😂😂😂
Its all fun and games till ned asks if they ever thought about his wife...😂
"I'll kill you right here" I almost fell out of my chair laughing because of how serious he was. 😂
John is my new best friend
Guys Eugene wants kids....
John scares me
WAS THAT A PARKS AND REC REFERENCE AT THE END????!!!!!
0:30 john is god confirmed
"I'll kill you right now."
Omg.
keith: i don't like any dogs







i died a little inside
The man is against lying but he's all game for murder? Interesting
How does John keep a straight face
Adam ruins everything comes in
John is what makes this
Zach is adorable
John is my spirit animal.
John is so mean!
3:53 SAME
"God hates liars and I hate liars"

You trying to imply something?
The thought of being able to tell if people are lying seems horrifying.  Lies are told for a reason.
Ned is absolutely self-absorbed
5:17 IM DYING
ned: i dont know those babies
See now, that polygraph guy was wrong god doesn't hate anyone even if they don't belive in him he doesn't hate then jealous is just disappointed in them
the try guys are my spirit animals
I knew Keith likes Zach the most:')
Try guy " orphans or wife"
Man "I would kill her"
A lie detector does not determine if you are lying or not
Zach asked the best questions
"I'll kill you right here."
this is so good
Do you ever want children 
Eugene: yes
oohhh i thought you hated little babies
Lie detector tests are pseudoscience at best. Anyone can fool a lie detector, just stay calm.
That part where Eugene said hair is the only thing people told was good about him and then Keith said he didn't even had that, is where i was the saddest.
hdue
Everyone's like who's your favorite then when they get to Eugene it's who do you like
I have to tell everyone a grave secret:





Lie detectors don't work. They measure stuff like your heartbeat and sweat patterns.
i'll marry you Zack
when they asked eugene if he wanted kids and he said yes i was like HELL YES he gon make beautiful babies
1:09 zach is too cute!!
the guy who says he's telling the truth sounds really mad
this is my favourite try guys episode
Omg when said I'd kill her I broke out into full blown belly clenching laughter
All hail the Zagene ship! 😂
THIS WAS SO FUNNY
I want John's wife to comment about him wanting to kill her
"God hates liars and I hate liars". John is God
ayyyyyy it's john!
john low-key really scares me
Who else knows ya boi John from All Def Digital
JOHN
The tall guy with the glasses looks like he should be on a rowing team at Harvard.
So are we all just going to ignore the pivotal existential epiphany about Keith and his fried chicken??? 😂🍗
What I've learned from this is that everyone loves Keith.
If Keith gave up fried chicken, he could still have a breast and a thigh, wink wink
That was great! :D
In Keith's defense, he is the is the best.
4:29 "We should have a black member right?"
Consider this YouTube comment my application
Eugene seemed slightly arrogant at face value, this changed my whole view of him.. and well, as for ned? ...[insert poop emoji]
Buzz feed more like this please more like this
Keith is sick even when he's selfish.
John dude chill out 😂😂😂
when they talked about Johns marriage omg that was my favorite part. x3
this was awesome, funny, entertaining, and heartwarming all rolled up into one
Eugene is actually really insecure...
That's so sad as he seems to be a great guy
Polygraphs don't actually detect lies, the human brain is too complicated. The polygraph measures heart rate, breathing, blood preassure and sweating which can be caused by a stressfull question giving a false positive. Good night.
turn down the music volume... my house is shaking just to hear them talking
Okay my question is who did Zach make out with???
are they all gay?
zach: "do you think i'd make a good husband"
ned: smiles and stares deeply into the camera for a very long time
ned: ....yes...
john: he's lying

the rest of them dying in the background had me laughing so hard
Did he say dog hate liars and also i hate liars or Did he say god hates liars??
Actually it has been proven that lie detectors are not accurate and honestly should not be used at all
Oh god I would never agree to this!!!
pseudoscience
''God hates liars, and i hate liars.''
John is lying.
OBVIOUSLY EUGENE IS THE BEST TRY GUY
Is it just me or is anyone else actually concerned or terrified with the guy.
HOW THEY WEAR THE SUITS THO XD
lmao buzzfeed always uses hall of the mountain king for background music
I'm gonna be honest I hate Ned
Doesn't seem like that guy has depression
Eugene has his tie loose me: YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
gotta get that 10 minute ad revenue buzzfeed
"I'd kill her" dead😂
I really wanna try this with my freinds XD
Can we have a try guys vid where they try to make Eugene feel happy? Eugene has the most beautiful smile I have seen.
I LOVE JOHN
LOL John pls
I'm surprised that Eugene said "yes" to the child part even the other guys were surprised at that or maybe he's just good at lies 🤔
Wow "god hates liars, I hate liars"
this was so funny lol
7:18 Im Zach and all my friends are Keith... #SadLife
It's scary that john wasn't lying when he told Ned he would kill him😂
This was great
Somehow Keith turned out to be more devious than I thought
I will date Zach just to prove Keith wrong!! I've actually had a crush on Zach for as long as I've been watching Try Guys 😘
"I will kill you right here."  xD John is my favorite try guy
"I like being hooked up to machines"
I don't know those babies
OMG need is so cute "I-I dont kn-know" (btw not that kind of cute)
ADD JOHN TO TRY GUYSSS
John said God hates liars and i hate liars. 
Just that part 'God hates ...' made me not like him if you know what i mean. 
Not trying to be discriminating xD
That is some chemistry with these guys.
Do you believe in true love? 
Eugene: " no" 
Everyone "aww"
So Eugene believes in ghosts but not true love.. what has your mother done to you? What is she taught you about love..




W W WAIT HOLD UP FORGET ALL O THAT!! KEITH IS ENGAGED?!?!
"I kill her"- John
jon slays my life
Polygraphs don't work. They just test if you're nervous about subjects...
Where the hell did they find John?
I'll kill you right here ha ha
The lie detector guy is my spirit animal.
"I don't know any of those babies"💀😭
This just confirms that every man has gay thoughts from time to time.
Zachs laugh is adorable
when every other comment is about "we gotta be better about that" :|
Tea has been spilled.
God hates liars lmao
Eugene wants kids in the future! I am so hopeful for him.. he must believe in love after all. And being a child of divorce he won't let those kids down 😍
God hates liars and John hates liars
when zack said do u like neds dog who else thought he said ned stark?
Can we have a vote on who the favorite Try Guy is?
John is kinda creepy...
But I also kinda like it😂
gay and fake
Who's YOUR favorite try guy?
"Well, everything's a toy when yo play with it" -Zach 2017. So true tho
"Well, everything is w
I wish I could be in Eugenes life and like make him believe in love. He is so cool.
I love Keith and Zach!
John is a savage
I am commenting so much right now
This was such a good video!
Damn, Ned looks so cheeky when he is lying
Ned looks like a giggling school girl when he is answering the questions
John looks sad
that whole situation between Ned and john was hilarious with the whole marriage and wife thing 😂
"I'd kill her"
Who else knows John from ADD   ?
Eugene is hilarious
The try guys is just a perfectly balanced squad. 
1. Dog person (Eugene, Ned) vs Cat person (Zach, Keith)
2. In a relationship (Ned, Keith) vs Single AF (Eugene, Zach)
3. Competitive/Challenging (Ned, Eugene) vs Friendly/Cuddly (Zach, Keith)
4. A bit too confident (Ned, Keith) vs A bit insecure (Eugene, Zach)
Well except that Eugene's the only asian dude, child of divorce, and the only guy with that damn sexy hair.
If John's been a polygraph examiner for so long he should know that it doesn't actually detect if someone's lying. It just checks things like pulse to see how nervous they are so someone can be telling the truth but have anxiety and the polygraph would say they're lying. Same thing goes the other way around, many criminals have just stayed calm while telling lies and gotten away with it
Best Try Guys episode ever
I NEED A CLIP OF WHEN HE GOES I don't need your EXplanAtion
"I don't know those babies"
"I don't know those babies"
Kieth is gross.
as i learned in Lie To Me,  polygraphs say you're lieing if you show a rise in a certain emotion. the emotion Eugene could of felt might have been disgust, not sexual arousal.
Keith is my favorite 😂
"God hates liars and I hate liars" lol I find myself saying this alot
Lie detector are just meant to scary criminals into making them tell the truth
I enjoyed this
Have you not seen the Adam ruins Lie Detector Tests?
LMAO!! XD XD XD
I bursted out laughing when John was like "God hates liars, and I hate liars." like damn boy, you need a hug? who hurt you?
Keith doesn't like dogs...  :'(
moment of hope for women willing to have the "kiddies" for Eugene. :)
the detector guy didn't even smile for the whole video
John is literally me
"God hates liars, I hate liars." - John
😂😂😂
that lie detector guy was a little severe.......like chill dude...
Eugene says he doesn't believe in true love and my crazy girl brain was like "I will teach him". Then I found out he prefers dogs over cats, nah.
did you know polygraphs don't actually work that well
Eugene in the suit is perfection
Zach is my spirit animal.
Why is their reaction so delayed after John said I'd kill her???
"Everything is a toy if you play with it" DAMN WHAT IS MY MIND
John is scary.
A common misconception with lie detectors is that people assume they give instant magical results.. The truth is it's the person operating the system that's impt and how well you know the person who is taking the lie detector test.

People hooked up should go through a mock test to assess their behavior and physiology by being asked a few questions that are very obvious yes or nos. The more questions asked the more the assessor has data to work with.

Not too sure whether the try guys did it behind the scenes but in any case I would assume John is pretty accurate considering the Try Guys did not dispute much.

But definitely not 100% conclusive.
john will forever be in my nightmares
I really enjoyed this
The Try Guys, please, make a video of you reading fanfiction about you!!!
The examiners initial statement is not true. He says that god hates liars. God doesn't hate anyone no matter what they've done. He is incapable of hating, he loves everyone whether they lie, cheat or even murder.
Try Guy, Worth it, & Unsolved are the things holding up buzzfeed
Holy f* this was a good episode!
OMG this is the best one yet!
Then there's just Zach holding a lollipop.
John...wow. I wanna kill him too.
John was so serious oh my god
my heart somehow broke when NED said that it (their sweet married couple image) was anyway for show like ned was my favorite bc hes sweet and all but I also had this feeling that it was for show and this proves it huhu im brokn
why is nobody talking about how the polygraph examiner said "god hates liars, and i hate liars."
Eugenes getting serious questions while the others are like HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF PUTTING DICKS IN YOUR MOUTH
Did you know? Lie detector tests do not work.
Oh, ned got fu@#ed up'!!!
"GOD HATES LIARS " Woah there
there should be a black guy in the group
John is such a savage...but his beard..its so majestic..
Jon is a savage...But his beard is so majestic..
John killed me😂😂😂😂😂
ok Eugene wants children ... :D that made me happy for no reason ....can i be the mother? /._./
6:18 thank me later
John though
'no one likes nuns, Eugene.' falls of bed *
everybody's talking about 'we've got to be better about that' but nobody's talking about 'do you think you're the best tryguy'? Zach: '..no'.
I legit cried. He's so precious.
Can John be in more videos? LOL
i want to do this omg
Eugene saying he doesn't know how much the other guys care for him and that his hair is the result of his insecurities because he doesn't seem himself as attractive broke my goddamn heart.
Wait, are Eugene gay or not? Can someone please tell me that. No offend if he is!
is Eugene gay?
john is my favorite he so serious
I want to take a test so bad!
I WANT TO MARRY ZACH JUST PLEASE LET ME MARRY ZACH HES SO cuTE AND LIKE AWKWARDLY SEXY ): IM
Eugene omg! 😍
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST ITALIAN KIDS OML
Lie detectors don't work properly. It's fake
These things arn't 100% right. Only a joke of a justice system would take them serious in any way.
now can we get a video with one of those professionals like the "Lie to me" ones going through their day and pointing at the camera whenever they're lying?
eugene is the best try guy
Keith is the best liar. CONFIDENCE!!!
why is the comments filled with girls :)
Do you think I'd make a good husband, *yes * lies because Ned is a friend of Zac 😂
Erm... should we check if The Try Guys, especially Ned is still alive? John seems............ nice... :)
Zach×Eugene, I ship it. Let's get it a name. Maybe Zagene?
Do you think I will ever find love  "yes" *lies because it's his best friend 😂 poor Zac
God?
JOHN IS SCARY AF. LIKE IF I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE PREDATOR AND JOHN....
"i like being hooked up to machines" LMAO
polygraphs are honestly so easy to fool

all you have to do is stay calm and control your heart rate and breathing
A try guy wanting to have sex with another try guy. Don't believe in this bs machine. It gives completely false answers if you take classes on how to beat it. You can lie everything and it will say it's the truth.
LIE DETECTORS CAN BE COMPLETELY INACCURATE!! AND THEY HAVE PEOPLE TRAINED TO BEAT THEM!! THEY CAN SAY COMPLETE LIES AND THE MACHINE WILL READ YES!! So if a machine says did you cheat on your wife and the guy says no. the machine will catch his nervousness as a yes. So it is very unfair. and no interrogation officers use it as credible but they do use it for weak minded people for confessions.
I hate this because they always so fake . The older man does it for comedy purposes of course
When they were asking who was there favorite I'm surprised Keith didn't say "KEITH"
Literally anyone: "buzzfeed makes the best, unbiased videos."
Lie detector: BEEP BEEP MUTHAFACKA
Lie detectors are proven to be bull
When Ned said marriages usually fade, it reminded me of last night when my partner and I were out with our friends. We kissed and smiled and one of them said "ugh I can't stand you guys. You've been together for so long how do you still love each other?" We laughed so hard XD   (This guy is in a ridiculous on-off relationship with an emotionally abusive girl, so his views are loosely based off of stereotypes and commonality.) Hilarious joke, though.

That moment when you try to explain good relationships to someone, but can't stop laughing.
The administer is scary as hell.
POLYGRAPHS DONT WORK YOU GUYS. I mean for comedy's sake this was great, but yeah,  hope you knew that
John oh my god
this was way more awesome than I anticipated.
John should be a try guy
John is the best part of this video lmao
Lie detectors don't work
@2:50 he totally sounds like a women
Eugene looks so hot with his sleeves rolled up and his little black tie.
Zach: Hey, Keith? Do you like Ned's dog?
Keith: No.
Ned: ...wat
"Keith is telling the truth"
Keith again: I don't like any dogs!
Ned: You like Eugene's dog?
Keith: I do like Eugenes dog.
"Keith is telling the truth"
XD
$10 lie detector test vs $2500 lie detector test?
For real though, yall need a black member
that guy is so angry XD
Polygraph is not accurate :D
Okay how have they not done an escape room yet that's like the perfect try guy thing to do
No ones gonna mention Zach eating the lollipop the whole time
I missed steven
Eugene,every Try Guys video takes at least 2/3 of the comments about you,on how much you're awesome and we love you.

  So dang it man,feel the love,yo.
John is my favorite person in the world
I hate people who edit comments -
"everything's a toy if you play with it."

- zach "korndiddy" kornfeld
Okay, hold on!
Do we just act like Eugene didn't say "He likes to be hooked up to machines?! 

Please elaborate further?!
Greyhair guy is weird.
so whats the story behind zack's neck scar ?
John should be the new try guy
I see john everywhere 😭😭😭
would you kill the nuns or your wife
Ned: The nuns
The nuns: welcome to your tape
who else is terrified of John?!?!?!
Quite surprised with the questions asked.... they seemed very.... tame... Especially for the Try Guys...
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Eugene
I'll kill you right here!
i wanna test myself
I would hate to be john's daughter 
He would say where were you last night and strap me up to see if I was lying 😂😂😂
"God hates liars and I hate liars" help I'm scared
Johns life is sad
Proof Eugene is bi ☺️
the thing that's really sad about this video is john he doesn't smile
John is a lowkey psychopath
the lie detector guy seems so done
john is hilarious lmao
John is so stone faced.
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" well, this guy's a genious.
Polygraph tests are fake and can be really easy to fool many serial killers have passed a lie detector
my god i HATE buzzfeed sjw useless turds
think this is my favouritest try guys video yet hahha
Eugene, don't you dare replace anybody. DON'T YOU DARE!!!
Zach:They all go to me!
Me:COME TO PEN HEAVEN YES YES YES PEN HEAVEN
John is so enthusiastic
Lie detectors are flawed.
god doesn't hate liers he likes every whone
hmmm... never noticed that scar on Zach's neck before 🤥
The guy behind the lie detector is so serious lol😂😂😂
"he telling the truth"
"he's lieing"
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"God hates layers"...omfg
i don't know the babies killed me xD
LOOK AT ALL OF THE LIKES!
everything is a toy if you play with it <3
Zach in that white shirt...lord have mercy the things I'd do to him.
"I don't know those babies "😭
Damn, ned looks like moriarty in that brown shirt.
Zach is so damm cute awww
Question #1 Are you the f*ckboy
is your love for ariel for show ned said yes its kinda like instagram
I love how john can keep his facial expression as blank as possible during this
I love John so much.
This was excellent.
I liked this video, there isn't enough Eugene & Zack love.
I don't know those babies
When he said "god hates liars i hate liars" I was like "it was only a banana on a bush"
God hates liars and I hate god
NED: "boat full of orphans, or your wife"
JHON: "I'd kill her"
ME: bursts out laughing to the point that my parents are like SHUT UP
Next Episode of Try Guys, we cherish Eugene more, and make sure he knows!!
Eugene is so hot!
"God hates liars...and I hate liars!"

So basically he hates himself... (cause there is no god cough cough)
Sometimes Keith can be evil LOL
i think this john is also the same one in the real talkshow
John is like the final boss in a horror game...
At 9:14 when Zach had to answer if he was the best made my heart melt because he had to think about it even though as fans of the try guys we can answer and definitely say yeah he is the best but maybe because he was really thinking and had like a sad moment there where he had to pause
"Nobody likes nuns, Eugene. I grew up catholic"
"God hates liars, and I hate liars." Does that make you God?
feels like the guys are losing momentum, I mean alot of these videos are too familiar to other buzzfeed videos, everything they've put out recently has been kinda "meh"
John should have been separated into another room or at least not listen to their conversation!
I hope John's wife isn't watching. lol
Zach is seriously cute!  He is clearly the cutest of the other Try Guys and I bet that makes them jealous.  At least it should as he is that adorable.
This and the therapy session are probably the best Try Guys videos.  I love when you get personal and uncomfortable.
Eugene we think you're amazing! <3
John: "I'd kill her"....Lmao I died😂😂
Do they know that the polygraph dosen't work?
One of the best try guy videos
Gosh, I wish I could give Eugene a hug. I feel like I relate to him in so many ways.
lying makes you go to hell
When zach laughs at 1:12 lol
"I don't know those babies"
I'm imagining of Eugene x Zach = Babies
I DON'T THINK JOHN WAS JOKING.
Conclusion: Keith is egoistical
'God hates liars, and I hate liars' wtf? why don't I trust this polygrap dude?
Here are the results, I only used the ones where John specifically said it was truth or a lie.
Keith: 3 lies, 10 truths
Zack: 4 lies, 5 truths
Ned: 3 lies, 6 truths
Eugene: 2 lies, 11 truths

I was just curious. I know there are other variables to truth/lie detection but just based on what you can see from a polygraph these are the numbers for what we saw in the video.
Am I the only one who wants to jump in the screen and hug Eugene?
:Ned trying to explain how his marriage is better then John's:
:John: turns head towards Ned 
John: I can kill u right here

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
After this the group broke up 😂
john is the best man here
Kys
eugene's answers just make me want to hug him or just like drink obscene amounts with him (feel like he would more appreciate the later)
gotta get that ad revenue by coincidentally making the video 35 secs longer than 10 minutes
well john serious
John is my favourite try guy
"Everything's a toy if you play with it"
"Everything's a dildo if you're brave enough"
My grandmother from the Philippines is definitely a witch of some sort so I feel ya Eugene
"I'll kill her" IM DYING
I hope I find a woman that I love so much that I'll save her from a burning sinking boat rather than a bunch of nuns holding Italian babies who are also orphans on a burning sinking boat.
Check out the "Adam ruins everything" episode on Forensic Science to see the truth about lie detectors.
i smiled throughout the whole video
I mean of course Keith thinks he's better everyone else is wearing a white shirt and a tie and he's wearing a blue shirt😂
"I don't know those babies" 😂😂💀
7:57 when the best part of this video started. Oh boy, do I love Ned
😂😂😂 this is my favourite vid of all time
Some of these questions went really deep.
WHEN ZACH PULLS THE LOLIPOP OUT IN THE BEGINNING IM CRYING
So, Ned... best you start running for four different countries now.
Polygraph tests weren't invented to detect lies, they were invented to test heart rate, blood pressure and other medical factors
"A boat full of newborn Italian babies" 😂😂😂
"I don't need your explanation" - Keith

I was dying
this is a heavy one
god hates liars and i hate u
I agree with John about killing my spouse xD 

the most talented person in the group does not think he is...why were Eugene's answers all sad.
💜 this 😂
Zach: "do you think you have a better marriage than John?"
Ned: "I assume so, yeah."
John: welcome to your tape
Why is John so goddamn serious?
hes telling the truth
"Anythings a toy if you play with it" 😂😂
i love how they all like keith the best and he thinks hes the best try guy, like they're not wrong he is the most pure soul of them all hahaha
We talk about how funny the guys are in this video, but John was HYSTERICAL.
This is the old Buzzfeed crew that's why it's a good video. Take note Buzzfeed. Constantly replacing your video producers because of your stringent requirements for your employees is gonna ruin you some day. Mark my words. People dislike change, they want to see Gabby, Allison, Zach, Ned, etc.
why dont they do lie detector tests with police?
Who else wants to see more of these XD
"Do you think I've ever find love?"

Keith: "yeah!"

Keith is lying

I'm dying 😂😭
God loves everybody but hates there sins. So John is giving us false information.
Though I loved some of, Keith's answer, Zach had the best line at the very end when he said, "Everything is a toy if you play with it."
I love how they still love each other
"I dont know those babies"
The polygraph test dosen't work.
"I don't know those babies" I love Ned!! lol
hate is such a strong word I would say god dislikes liars you should choose your words wisely
do you guys know that the lie detector doesn't detect lies is just detect sweat , heart beat , blood pressure , what happens if they just workout?
I just looked Ned's wife Ariel Fulmer and my goodness, she is really beautiful!! 
Also I love her coz she has a crafty/design type job, I personally love knitting/crochet Ravelry.com  some of the great Hedgehog Fibres/ Countess Ablaze/ Madelinettosh yarns you can get these days, it's art, and the pieces they make are just about fabulous enough for cute and funny guys like the Try Guys!! (I mean look at how well the designer Stephen West wears it lol).
eugine is the best so sexy
Eugene looks so damn hot here
kk
He looks so depressed in his job. And yes I'm telling the truth.
John is HIGHKEY creepy
Please add John to the try guys.... he's a young savage and he's trapping so hard
why does eugene remind me of josh dun??
Lie Detector tests dont work and are terrible
jhon has no chill! hahaha
God hate liars  and i hate liars  , amen to that🙌🏻❤
Eugene wants childeren. Fuken take mine now goddd
john is my bae.
Awww, Eugene wants kids! I volunteer as a tribute!

Also, I could've told almost all of these answers, guys :D
that Polygraph examiner is a little intense there in the beginning sounds like a serial killer who stalks his victims subdues them and puts them through "the examination" if they fail that's when the rusty hacksaw comes out
Lie detector tests are proven to be wrong. Eg, Adam ruins everything.
why is eugene the asian guy in the green hornet?
angry christian
Best. Try guys.  EVER!!!!!
DO 👏🏾 THIS 👏🏾 WITH 👏🏾 LADYLIKE👏🏾
Woooooooowwwwwwww 100k thumbs up yassssss!
lol "I don't know those babies"
lmao i love John 😂😂😂
Guys the polygraph machine doesn't work it's fake watch Adam ruins everything's episode on it it's really interesting
PART 2 PLEASE
When they all started cracking up after John said "I'll kill you right here" I lost it
John sounds like a robot😂
John was just so unfazed by everything, it was hilarious! Seriously I just looked at his face to see his reaction.
im scared of john
For all we know this guy is playing pac man and just saying "Lie!" "Truth!"
The setup tho😂
Lie Detectors are BS, a nervous person could easily be identified as a liar and a calm person who's lying can't be detected. Also even if it could work it would be useless with questions that deal with complicated emotions ie "do you love your wife?" it seems like an easy question, but if your nervous about responding  it'll will give you a false report and if you had an argument recently it would also mess with the results.
Eugene wants children! Omg. I would have never thought such a thing!
'God hates liers'

What is it with Americans and bringing God into literally everything they do. Talk about indoctrinated.
Zach: You think you have a better marriage than John?
Ned: I assume so, yknow.. he's older, marriages tend not to get as good" 
John: "I'll kill you right here"😂
Eugene ...U don't need a token black guy in the group
Haha polygraph tests don't work
"Do you believe in ghosts" 

Imao Keith's face 😂😂
John: "I'll kill you right here" 

Imao I can't 😂😂
Best episode imo
Concentrate
Keith: "Do you think I'm ever going to find love?"
Zach: "Yea!"
Poly guy: ".....Keith is lying"
hi
God hates lies and I hate lies.
Zack: Do you ever think I'll find love 
Keith: No 
Ned: No 
Zack: Welcome to your tapes
I just really want to hug Eugene even more now. He's a good cupcake.
hes telling the twuth
Very personal questions:
"Do you like Ned's dog?"
Eugine should get with a hot girl and settle down, attractive guys and attractive girls should get together more often.
Eugene needs a hug :(
Hey it's John from ADD
I was really hoping John (examiner) to say: God hates liars and I hate liars, I am God.
Got to be my fav video of the try guys XDD
They should've checked clearly whether Eugene wanted on Zach XDD
"I don't know those babies" 😭
Zach if you want love so bad I'm single
I will kill u right here 😄😅😆
7:03 do u think ull ever marry. Yea he's telling the truth. then why u give me so much s**t about it
Eugene is a child of divorce????
John must be lots of fun at party 🎉
i'm a nun so i'll neat the hell outta you 3
John does not look like a guy id want to run into in a dark alleyway...
7:46 best laugh ever!
The lie detector does not work
Ultimate lie rule to pass any lie detector: lie close to the truth and be like Deadpool and not care about the question, lie, truth or even yourself in the moment of the question. Or just believe in the lie so your heart rate doesn't jump.
the tester scares me
EUGENES HAIR WAS THE ONLY THING COMPLIMENTED WHEN HE WAS YOUNG??!!! well screw those people now Eugene is the hottest ever 🙌🏼
Keith:"John is lying, that's true" 
John:"Keith is lying"
I need 10 hours of this not 10 minutes come on buzzfeed understand us please.
This was hilarious!!!
john is the best man
I wish this was more personal 😹
Does Eugene remind anyone else of Magnus (from Shadowhunters)?
Eugene was the HOTTEST!!!
when the other try guys asked keith who his favourite try guy was, i thought he was going to say himself lol 😂
John is an intense guy
They should make a show where women or men think that their lover is charting in them and they question them using the polygraph
They should make a show where women or men think that their lover is charting in them and they question them using the polygraph
I no longer see ned as the sweetest man ever when he admitted it's only for show.
"God hates liars, and i hate liars" Omg, thats.. xD scared me
Lmao
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."
... This suddenly took on a much more serious tone 😅😅😅😅
I feel like the lie detector is so fake
Ned: Do you believe in true love ?
Eugene: No
Me neither, this is so relatable™
I totally understood "Ned stark" at 7:40 and didn't get why "dog" came up afterwards...
no way I give up fried chicken :o
I'm pretty sure the Try Guy Eugene wants to have sex with is Eugene.
john needs to be a try guy xD
When buzzfeed steals all digital defs idea mmm really good 👌
I love how John sounds like a robot

' KEITH  IS  TELLING  THE  TRUTH'
funny to watch, but these machine is not very accurate .
The lie detector doesn't work, it's just made you to be scared shitless enough to make you confess
It's so weird that Keith doesn't like dogs. Just seems... wrong.
10:16 was that a parks and rec reference?
When you watch too much Adam Conover
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Lie Detector is not 100% always correct when you are nervous mostly LIE
I love how everyone act like cops in a movie and then zach shows up with a lolipop
that guy is from ADD
Lie Detectors don't work
I would make out with korndiddy.
Eugene... Believes in ghosts, but not true love. Me af
Eugene I wanna hug you !!! It makes me sad that he feels that way .
I laughed during all of this.
"I don't know these babies"
"I don't know these babies" omfg savage
this squad is my fave
Everything is a toy if you play with it
"I don't know those babies"
When Ned mentioned Becky Keith's face lit up ❤️
Just like any other Instagram couples, fake affections are just for showing off, in which Ned has admitted to it.
who hurt you john
john is my favourite try guy
lie detectors read too much anxiety from pulses are are not nor have they ever been a reasonable source of testimony or conviction. However it is really fun to use as a game and some boding, these guys are so adorable. Like when they felt bad Eugene didn't necessarily trust their affection. And all their relationship chatter.
Keith: I don't like any dog
Ned: Do you like Eugene's dog
Keith: Yes I like Eugene's dogs
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What if John is lying? 😱
7:22 "GAMMIT QUICHE"
NED WTF NUNS ARE BADASS
Is this john from ADD?????
keith should have said keith
This was amazing!
The Try Guys play ice-skate
I guess John is Toto the truth teller....








If anyone gets that reference you're a legend
John is likely the only real criminal in the room, though the cameraman must remain suspect. Seriously, John is an imposter because the circumstances of the tests are nothing like those required for a Polygraph to be legit. 

The test has absolutely no authenticity but then it really only mirrors most of the Polygraphs ever given. Why do you think that they are not used in any other country bar America and ever there they are not admissible in court?
It's kinda sad that eugene doesn't believe in true love but wants to have kids cause doesn't that kinda mean that he'd want to get married but he expects it to go wrong someday and get a divorce..?
everythings a toy if you play with it
zach is so cute HAHAHAHAHA
Zach and Eugene anyone?
Awe Eugene, he's really hurt
You know who they need in the Try Guys? JOHN.
I WANT TO KNOW WHO ZACH MADE OUT WITH!! ALL THREE OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!!not meant to sound creepy, I'm just really curious.
MY HEART DURING THIS VIDEO!"I believe in Ned and Ariel's love""Do you know how much we care about you!""Do you think I'll find love?""Yes I want children"
since english isn't my native language, so i really want sub-title which is not the auto one
john is so serious
Funniest parts of the video we're seeing the rest of them in the background laughing at whoever was hooked up to the lie detector
Polygraphs r a myth
polygraph tests are not accurate at all
"I'll kill you right here" lolol the way he turns to him
I hope Eugene works out his issues!!!
lol the lie detector guy gives me weird vibes.
Dzuma... Dzuma...
Aww Eugene :(
I love the try guys but I love John even more
OMG !
Try guys need 1 black 1 white 1 Asian and 1 jew
I'm living for John's monotone voice
more!!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars." I thought he was going to say "therefore, I am God" lmao
Without Keith, The Try guys wouldn't be as funny! 1:04
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 

Yikes. See y'all in hell.
They should add a black member, tbh.
John does not want to be there.
John only says Keths name when he's telling the truth. 'Keth is telling the truth'. And with the others he doesn't
the guy doing the test seems so miserable
John I felt like he was like just get out
John is like a real life Ron Swanson and I love it so much
plot twist: Eugene doesn't belive in true love and thinks Ned gonna divorce because he is having affair with Ariel. Lap dance episode, I'm looking at you!
When ned  says everyone hates nuns I grew up catholic  😂 I relate to that sooooo much lol
i like keith best too :D
I LOVE JOHN OMG CAN HE BE A PART OF THE TRY GUYS
He's tellin the troooot
"It's not a toy"😂
#johnforpresident
Don't worry Ned, I don't like nuns either
I wonder which people Zach made out with... ;)
I friggin LOVE John!
Wow.... 
Half an hour after the upload, there were only 87 views. 
Now 12 hours later, there's 2.1 million views!!!😵
Everyone likes Keith, he's the best. :')
John is my new favorite try guy
They should ask John to join the Try guys 😂
"I don't know those babies"
"It's not a toy" my Grampa 😂
They need to do a weird eating challenge!
funniest thing ive seen on youtube for a looong time! saving this for later
I could watch 5 seasons of this and still not be bored. Because the questions would get weirder and weirder.

"Would you date an elephant for a month if it would cure cancer."
"Hell yeah! Cure cancer!? I would MARRY that damn elephant."
"How about in heels?"
"Oh, no. Beep that."

". . . . . . .He's telling the truth. . . ."
I think this was my favorite try guys video, and I think it was because they've shot so many videos and accumulated so many inside jokes that the humor created itself. wouldn't have been funny earlier on. 

also john. 😆😆
"God hates liars and I hate liars" OMG HE IS GOD😱😱
4 useless worms wasting oxygen da faq
This was awesome! Love that it wasn't super short.  I hope they do this again sometime!!
John reminded me of Ron from parks and rec
"I don't know those babies." OMG! Ned is a savage! But he's a savage in love. <3
I ship Keith and Eugene
"I'll kill you right here"
litterly could not stop laughing XD John is killing me
Polygraph tests are fake
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."
Respect earned.
ZACS LAUGH IS SO CUTE AT 1:23
"I dont know the babys" oh god i laughed too hard
Eugene likes to hook up to machine ladies.  😏
God hates liars. John hates liars. John is God.
god hates lies and I hate lies. therefore, I am god.
wow OK why
The Lie Guys
Keith is the best try guy though!
Eugene seemed so meloncholic the entire video :( I hope he's doing alright
Dude John looked so pissed for some reason
John is my constant mood tbh 😂😂😂
Lie detector results are not admissible in court due to their inherent unreliability.
john was prob questioning eugenes sanity
eugene i swear you look like my classmate
GOD Eugene looks so hot in the suit
I can't possibly be the only one who doesn't like (is terrified of) john
This was better than I thought it was
that old guy is............
I don't have words for him
Do it again
JOHN IS SO BLUNT ITS HILARIOUS
for your next try you video you should: try guys have long hair for a week
What do Lie Detectors and Buzzfeed have in common?...  :o




People think they work but they really don't.  ;3
So who's gonna be the black guy????
Eugene is the cutest one and he doesn't lie (barely)
Eugenes so stone cold
John is my favourite try guy
LOL! When the whole comment section is comments from John
That "Do you think you have a better marriage then John" was the most hilarious question and Neds explanation!! 😂😂😂
That was so rude on what they said about the nuns. So sad.
aw I ship Zach and Eugene ♥
John reminds me of Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation.
I love john omg
this is like REALLY the best episode of the try guys <3
I love the try guys 😂💕
LOL, John is like Huck from Scandal 😲😲😲
I'm the same as zach. I never answer yes or no questions with yes or no
You guys do realize that it's easy to misguide a polygraph. It's not reliable
I want a completely unedited version of this.
Polygraphs don't work.
Oh, my gawddddd this has to be my top Try Guys video ever. These questions are seriously so deep, I just can not! Like my mind was blown on many of the guys answer vs. the truth like wuhh.... 
Good job guys.
This gave me so much laughter, I LOVE IT!
Ned:rambles about how he thinks shawns marrige is worse than his. 
Shawn: ill kill you right now
7:22
aaaaawwww 
😢
i feel like Keith has been engaged forever
Keith to Ned: "Are any of those just for show?"
Ned: "Yeah, sure."

I feel so betrayed.
"I like being hooked up to machines"
EUGENE NO
"Keith is lying" zach laughs "I wouldn't want on my chest." OHHHHHHH get rekted Zach OHHHH
God loves everyone
Idk what it is but i love this Lie detector guy xD
Woah, 2 million views in one night😮✨🎉
ok John is all together hilarious and frightening!
Does anyone else think Zack looks like he has more hair in this video than the last one ?
Thank you john for being the best person alive ever.
john is scary
It's the give it a whirl fuckers
'do you believe in true love'
'no'

and here is my fav try guy
Damn Ned is looking good in this video, did he do something different with his hair?
God does not hate liars. He hates that they lie. Big difference.... and John, so should you. Follow the example of God you lie detecting maniac!!!
I'm The only one that wanna know who co-workers Zach kiss????
i don't know those babies
Awww, Eugene...
I like John, he's a cool dude
"keith is telling the truth"
"i don't know those babies"😂😂😂
then john was like i'll kill you right here but then he says he'd kill her
TRY GUYS DO ROLLER DERBY!!
Zack: Do you know how much the three of us care about you?
Eugene:.....No.
John: He's telling the truth.
Keith whispers: We gotta be better about that. 

Quietly sobs in a corner
"Everything is a toy if you play with it"  LOL he is right! ♡
lol i dont know those babies. but thats fucked up
Its older Billy Mays!
Keith you right
Damn all of Eugene's answer made me want to give him a hug
The way Zach was eating a lolly for the video
john was the true star of this try guys video
Every time I see a new video of the Try guys, I fall in love with Eugene even more. <3
Eugene doesn't believe in true love but he believe in Ned's love!!
Why do I love the scenery and the feel to it? Like a cop show.
john is my kind of guy
"God hates liars, and I hate liars." i was waiting for a i am god joke but nOO
Jon is like "I'll kill you right here"
Zach : "do you think I'll ever find love?" Keith: "yeah"  dude: "Keith is lying" 😂😂😭
Lie detectors are bs, many serial killers passed that tests just by being calm.
Jon is a streak savage
Ned is my fav :)
"I don't know those babies"
Eugene was just rude 😔 they all asked funny or cute questions towards themselves, but Eugene was asking questions that hurt the person and that's jut horrible
this is so funny!!!! well done buzzfeed lol
Lol you might as well flip a coin to know whether they are telling the truth
ADD ME TO THE TRY GUYS!!!!!
"ill kill you right on the spot"
sounds like a quote i said before
I love how the lie detector said God hates let's and so do I
Eugene and Zach?? Wyd
I love John. "I'll kill you right here" "I'd kill her"
Why is zach so hottt
"I'll kill you right here"
have the try guys try long acrylic nails for a day!!
John is one creepy mf .
John is convinced the try guys are going to hell.
"do you kill the Italian baby boat" I LOST IT IM SITLL LAUGHING
It kinda makes me sad that Eugene doesn't belive in love
Eugene is HOT AF
Is anyone else sick of the try guys?
Zach at 7:35 - 7:45, is totally me while watching this entire video 😂😂
8:23-
John: I'll kill you right here
Computer: John is telling the truth
Does John remind anyone else of the guy in 10 Cloverfield Lane? 👀
john is scary, but I love it 😂
"I'll kill you right here." 

He's telling the truth.
The INVENTOR of the "lie detector test" has said multiple times that's it is not accurate and should not be used to measure truth vs. lie, and yes, he has said this to the US government too.
Eugene's answers are kind of concerning....
...you know these things can be cheated yeah?  they are not actually detecting lies, just hot fast your heart is going or breathing... a sociopath can easily cheat the "lie detector"
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST VIDEO I HAVE EVER WATCHED
Make john a try guy.
Zach really did get the bad roll of the dice. balding, skinny, poor eyesight, excess amounts of body hair, oh and he has the weakest sperm of the try guys.
They pissed off john lol
Ned's mouth is his tell. Every time he lies he "frowns" to try and hide a smile.
"I like being hooked up to machines."
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." 
Those two like got me
I don't know why people are now shipping Zach and Eugene. I still ship Zach and Keith. Everybody loves Keith and Keith loves Zach
John is very intimidating.....
90% of what Eugene said is making  me sad I just   want  to MAKE HIM FEEL HAPPY
This is my favorite try guys video!
Damn it!! Ned is looking so sexy ultimately...
wrong. god doesn't hate.
They should have titled it the Lie Guys instead
THEY WERE ALL SURPRISED WHEN HE SAID HIS FIANCÉ OVER CHICKEN OMG 😂😂😂
let's be honest keith is the best try guy
should it maybe be called.. "the lie guys" ?
can I be that black addition to the try guys, a girl?
LOOOL JOHN WAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST
Wtf is eugene's story about his mother. She's psychic after sucking on a psychic teet in a war?
JOHN IS KILLING ME AHAHHA
So I totally think Eugene is just so good that he can lie to a lie detector.
John seems extremely bored...
Actually, polygraph tests are very unreliable, they can only detect physical factors such as heart rate and sweat which just means you're nervous. Being nervous doesn't mean you're lying, that's why polygraph tests are disputable in court and up to the judge's discretion. I urge you guys to learn more for yourself
Zach and Eugene.the ship has sailed.think ABOUT the fanfics
didn't Adam ruined the lie detector...and now they are using the same freaking thing...
Why are they all dressed like mr crocker??? Are they hunting FARIES
salt my dish bartender
Is Eugene wearing foundation in this video?
Poor John with all the Try Guys yelling.
John seems like the reason why he hates liars is because maybe his parents might have lied to him or also his friends lie.
I relate to Zach so much in this video 😂
When Keith said "we gotta be better about that" 😭
Polygraph tests don't work. It comes down to many factors, but if you are calm as you are normally, you'll pass, even if you do lie. There was also an Adam Ruins Everything episode on this (on YouTube). Search for it and watch that shizzle.
didn't you ever know the polygraph is extremely inaccurate.Check out it's episode on Adam ruins everything from collegehumour.
Polygraphs just measure sweat and heart rate?
It took me half the video to realise that they were changing shirts when it was their time
i don't like ned
God doesn't hate anybody John, chill.
can john be a try guy please
the lie detector guy is Ron Swanson plus 20 years
Love John! I want more of him! So funny!
We all love pesto.. the dog, not the sauce.. well the sauce too
hate to break this to you john but the polygraph does NOT WORK
7:30 korndiddy's laugh omg
Keith is secretly gay
Zach the playa!!!!!!!!!
Keith and Zach are the nicest in terms of personality while Eugene and Ned are driven by competition and are quite strict.
even though lie directors don't really work
I already shipped zach and Eugene and now I ship them even more
"What are these scenarios?" 
" I don't know those babies" 😂😂😂🤣😭😭
Anyone want me to post numerous studies all showing that polygraphs are total BS?
"Everything is a toy when you play with it" LOL Best way to end it Zach! Ahaha!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars.." 😂
7:31 
 Hey Keith, do you like Ned's dog?
No.  I don't like any dogs.
Do you like Eugine's dog?
I do like Eugine's dogs....
I love how John has such a straight face.
I've never noticed it before but Kieth looks like Tracy from the Tooth Fairy with Dwayne Johnson...
"god hates liars, and i hate liars." IM PEEINF OMFG JOHNN
"Do you think I'd be a good husband?"
"Yes..."
"He's lying"
i fuckin love this it's gold
Give john a Pepsi won't ya
John is great
7:15 though!!!
I'll kill you right here
LMAO
"do you know how much we care about you?' 
"... no"
"we gotta be better about that" 

  MY HEART IS HURTING EUGENE WE ALL CARE ABOUT YOU ALOT
Hi
EugenexZach sex tape
One of my favorite from the try guys 🙌🏼😂
That's why his hair's so big, it's full of secrets.
You ever look at a comment from a video that has a lot a likes and think "damn why didn't I say that"
john actually seems like a chill guy
This is intense
everytbings a toy if you play with it!
What I thought the comment section would be: The polygraph tests have been proven to be unreliable on so many accounts, due to it being one of the least scientific things still used to this day, so they ultimately mean nothing.

What it was: OMG I SHIP THESE GUYS SO MUCHHH
omg hahaha
Keith is the best!!
john: god hates liars and i hate liars
me: then you and god hate me because i lie a lot and by a lot i mean hmm...about over 1,000,000 times in my life
oh my god lie detector guy hes funny and so done with them xD
does this john guy have a youtube channel?
I like Eugene ❤️😂
zach and eugene should like get together
john maybe should like chill
"I don't know those babies"
Who hasn't thought about having sex with MY MAN Eugene.
John has been through some stuff
But they DON'T WORK. Hey it's funny tho.
Zach: "Eugene do know know how much the 3 of us care about you?"
Eugene: "No."
Polygraph Reader John: "He's telling the truth."
Keith: "We gotta be better about that"
!!!!!!!!!!!
Petition to add John to the Try Guys
"God hate liars"not much all are liers with reasons
I cried when Eugene said he didn't know how much they care about him. Poor Eugene. Usually he's bubbly and happy.
tbh... i ship eugene and keith.. they are the hottest out of all of them?
John scares me
Is he ok
Ned grew up Catholic. Happy Easter Ned :)
Eugene looked so cool and handsome answering those questions, he literally melted my heart. Guys he's just human too! He wants kids too!
Four reasons why I am still watching Buzzfeed 
1. Try Guys
2. Ladylike
3. Buzzfeed Unsolved 
4. Worth It
They should do try guys recreate the show silent library 🙃
Ned has a weird smile right before he lies
john has a lot of pent up anger. john needs a hug
Keith looks like a curious dad in this it's cute
More John!
I loved watching this.
so keith is everyone's favourite...haha cute
7:30
ahh
"Eugene do you know how much we care about you?"
"No."
"He's telling the truth"
"We've got to be better about that"
JOHN IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL I LOVE HIM
Is john is REALLY john?!?
I love that part when keith says "we've got to be better about that" when eugene does not know how much they care about him😢😍
Please!! I would love to see a part 2 to this!
No one's gonna talk about how Eugene wants kids? -
The best person in this entire video was john
John reminds me of Ron Swanson and I love it
"I don't know those babies.." oh Ned! 😂😂😂😂
What is a pickled cucumber?
John at 1:16 is making me so happy no wonder he'd kill his wife
I knew it john is god
Because we know polygraphs are just so goshdarn reliable.
8:19 John is the MVP
They say that keiths head grew three times that day
1 million views in 10 hours let's go try guys!
When Eugene said sex with Zac is gross
John the Savage: He's lying.

I also wish they'd get trained to try to fool the lie detector and the one to do it the best gets bragging rights.
when Eugene said no and Keith was like "we have to get better at that" my heart burst 😭😭
zach is a ladies man
favorite video so far
John is my spirit animal.
Zach is hot with that outfit!!
john is great. bring him back. more questions!
everybody loves Keith
MARRY ME EUGINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOST IT AT "GOD HATES LIARS, AND I HATE LIARS" LMAOOO
Lie detectors aren't real, they just focus on stress and they're not actual lie dectectors
i love john
why do i feel like they've done this before?
" I dont know those babies" lmfao!!!
eugene is so awesome- i lvoe his honestly! <3
hate doing this but... guys i just released a new song called "fuck.u" if u could listen to it, i would really appreciate it. Much Love<3

https://soundcloud.com/itsglake/fucku
"Nobody likes nuns, Eugene. I grew up Catholic." Lmfaoooooo I lost it at that!!!
I love it when John says "He's telling the truth."
I think John works for the Westboro Baptist Church on the side...😂😂
John really made me sad ahahah like his voice was so mono-toned, even when he said he'd kill the babies
I thought buzzfeed just wanted more money from try guys. I mean they made it into a youtube red exclusive
awh poor zack
I'm sorry but, lie detectors are a LIE
johns a real straight shooter. good man lol
JON IS MY FAVORITE PERSON😂😂
7:54-8:23 😂😂😂😂
I think John should join the try guys 😂hahaha he cracked me up so much
I love the profound moment when Keith says he'd give up fried chicken for the rest of his life to marry Becky, AND HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH! xD
wait wait, Eugene asked Keith if he want to put penises in his mouth or i misunderstood? 😮
Forget about Eugene..
I wanna give John a hug
Keith is the greatest
Who else is curious as to who Zach made out with ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Do people STILL not know that lie detectors DON'T work?
John Slowly Turns His Head I will kill you right here
Keith is my all time fav
"God hates liars and I hate liars." God doesn't hate anyone. He never has and never will.
That guy is from Add( All Def Digital)
He's lying
This was the most hilarious vidio
"I don't know those babies." - Ned. :3
"i don't know those babies" omg XD
My name is john and this here is my sis cough cough my uh my wife
<Inserts unoriginal comment that gets an unhealthy amount of likes>
When Eugene said he has a lot of secrets do you think he may have killed some people?
Did anyone else almost cry when they asked Eugene if he knows how much they care about him and he said no? And when Keith said with every ounce of seriousness, "We gotta be better about that." 😢😢😢
Make John a try guy 😂
The polygraph examiner reminds me of the one from ADD's Is it True series XD
Eugene is the most honest!
the amount of self control it took to not bust out laughing while watching this at 1 in the morning is huge😂😂😂
I wish buzzfeed employees were allowed to respond to comments.... This video has the best comments ever and I want to know their reactions!!!☹️☹️☹️☹️
Polographs are proven to be fake
I take psychology and in my class we talked about how lie detectors aren't credible, due to the fact that lie detector tests are based on physiological changes (I.e heartbeats and breathing), and habitual liars might not show any changes, while someone who's not lying might get nervous about the question itself, and appear to be lying even though they really aren't. Sorry to burst bubbles. Also, God doesn't hate anyone, so YOU'RE the one who's lying, John. ShAME
"God hates liars, and I hate liars" made me think "you really must hate liars to become a polygrapher" 😂
The dude is like "he's telling the truth" he's lieing "
"we've got stuff to deal with, you know... everybody does."

"i'll kill you right here."
I think John and I would be great friends, he had me at "And I hate liars"
Eugene is sooooooo fine!
johns my favorite
9:05 really wanted him to say Kieth...
I dunno those babies
Zach I'll marry you.
I love Eugene so much
Omg can john be a tryguy???? Please
Keith's favorite try guy is Keith
John should be on the try guys 😂
I want to give Eugene a big hug for the insecurities and hair comment. 😢😗😌 Let me love ya bby
"everything's a toy if you play with it" love it hahaha
Everything's a toy if you play with it
he hates liars and tests their honesty on the results or a machine that can't tell you 100% if someone is lying
I feel like John should now join the try guys
"eugene do you think that's weird?"

"no!"

"well it is."
Damn, Eugene is an Asian. Birdman ain't gon believe this.
I Also Hate Liars.. But i also have lied... so does the mean.. i hate myself...?
I remember watching this video..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................10 seconds ago..... XD
"I'll kill you right there." 
Me: OMG. Can he say that? Is that socially acceptable? He hasn't smiled one time in this video. Come on, John.
Zach's made out with 3 coworkers... there's 3 other try guys hMmmmMm....
I seriously thought Keith would say that his favorite try guy was himself.
my opinions on My Wife and Chicken and Rice plummeted in this video. I don't like them as much.
Anything to get to 10 minutes for ad revenue
Eugene is actual perfection
I don't think Eugene is hot. Sorry.
who hurt john
John creepy
Zach: "have you ever hooked yourself up to one of these and asked yourself questions in the mirror see what you truly believe 
John: "it's not a toy"
Zach: "well everything is a toy if you play with it." 
OMG ZACH!! 💕😂😂😂
JOHN LMAOOOOO
I loved this episode sooo much
"I don't know those babies" LOL 😂
whats the song at the end? aaa
This "Lie Detector Guy" is from "All Def Digital". Yall should check out All Def Digital, its a really good channel as well. #BlackPeopleHumor #Love
the polygraph doesn't work
The Try Guys tries drugs
Eugene omg 😂
buzzfeed not on trending omg 😱
"Do you know how much the three of us care about you?" 
"no"
"we gotta be better about that"
that was actually so sweet.
I LOVE JOHN EXCEPT FOR THE WHOLE GOD HATES LIARS IN THE BEGINNING
Can WE MAKE John THE newest try guy?
lie detectors are completeley innacurrate.
See, I wish Buzzfeed would stick to only these types of entertaining videos instead of the likes of "Questions _ People Have for _ People" which are so full of stereotypes and are racist behind a facade.
My new fav try guy vid😂
'I was born Catholic' 😂😂😂 me😂😂 hate nuns😂😂
John is my spirit animal
lie detectors don't work.
Are we ignoring Zachs a so posed office fuckboy
one more please!!
THIS WAS THE BEST!!! 'I'll kill u right here' ahahahahaha
i just want to know more about the story of the psychic
The dogs....hahah
John just trynna hide the fact that he's a lowkey freak
God hates liars... John hates liars

is john, god?
JOHN IS THE BEST PART OF THIS VIDEO
Polygraph's arent even a proper measurement of lies. they produce too many false positives (when someone's done it and the machine disregards it) and true negatives (when someone hasnt done it and the machine regards it) because it measures basic psychological levels like heartbeat and sweat and if someone's base measurements are faked (at the start) purposefully like through pain, then the rest of the questions will be 'oh he's not lying' vs. someone who's just naturally anxious because of the situation may be seen as lying.
"i like being hooked up to machines" Eugene 2017 😂😂😂
"I'll kill you right here" 😂😂😂😂
"where did the bad man touch you?" 
(signals hands)
"LIES!"
This made me laugh so much LOl.
This was hilarious
John is a psychopath.
but I like him
John reminds me of john goodman in  10 cloverfield lane
"Do you like Ned's dog"
"No"
"What!"
"I don't like any dogs"
"Do you like Eugene's dogs?"
"I like Eugene's dogs...."
"god hates liars, and i hate liars" slowly zooms in on face
Okay but lie detectors are only marginally more accurate than a coin flip and lots of courts don't admit polygraph evidence. So this video is more like an elaborate and costly version of an online buzzfeed quiz "These Picture Of Cats Will Tell If You're Lying"
Why did everyone choose Keith 😂
damn! eugene often sounds so depressed and self doubting, i just want to keep him on a blanket and give him tea till he feels better, then send him to therapy. Also i just adore Zach.
I'm supposed to be asleep it's so hard to laugh😂😂😂
This was amazing.
I want John to join at this moment because OMG WHEN HE TURNED AND LOOKED AT NED WHEN HE SAID HIS MARRIAGE IS BETTTER 😂😂😂😂
8:19 I LOVE JOHN HE WINS EVERYTHING
Gah John seems so bored
John is the best try guy
hi is Eugene single
There is no such thing as a lie detector
As time goes on, they just stop trying to lie
the only time john said anything except for "he's lying" or "he's telling the truth" was when ned said he had a better marriage than him and that'd he'd kill him right there. who hurt him?
How can you just not like bean. he's so adorable
I want to know more about Eugene's mums stories
Why......uh.....why does John scare me. .-.
we want part 2
damn John is intense😂
Love how they're all trying to look tough while they're interrogating each other, and Zach's just sucking on a lollipop lol.
"Nobody likes nuns Eugene" 😂
I love Keith too lol
I believe god doesn"t exist...DETECT THAT
ZACH LOOKED SO GOOD WTF
SUGGESTION: have you guys play the board game CLUE like, hand them the cards of who killed who etc and see if you can bypass the polygraph
later after the video john killed ned
I love how the lie detector guy maintains a straight face the whole time
John is a little.... off.
John is the best try guy
do another one !!!! that was interesting
I wanna sign a petition to make John a try guy😂
But you can fake lie detectors by keeping your heart beat low
hahaha.. when John said "I'll kill you right here."  I had to watch that twice it was so funny lol
i laughed so hard every time zach lied about how many co-workers he's made out with
John is my spirit animal 😂🙌🏼
7:14
All that matters
"I'll kill you right here" holy god I love John
Omg John is #DamagedBae
God hates liars and I hate liars 😂😂😂😭
MY FAVORITE VIDEO EVER OMFG KSJSIWKCNVIOSPQPX
Lie Detectors don't even work.
"I don't know those babies."
OKAY EVERYTHING ON EUGENE IS ATTRACTIVE ASF
John must be fun at parties
I think John needs a snicker
The marriage one😂😂😂
Ned 😂😂😂😂
I love the try guys
" everything's a toy if you play with it . "
lord .
i think Zach will find love😙😙😙
I want to know the questions that didn't get the video
John must be a hoot at parties
Omg I loved this so much! lol
That John has no chill
John is super creepy...
eugene is the best try guy
"I don't know those babies" me everyday.
omg zach was so cute in this.. but... he made out with 3 co-workers😂😂😂
Lie detectors don't work the way you want them to work.
Imagine the entertainment/pain of being a telepath? Getting excited about being able to hear peoples' thoughts, and getting hurt to hear what your loved ones think of you if it's bad.
john was the real mvp in this video
JOHN A SAVAGE!!
"So that was great, uhh I like being hooked up to machines" - Eugene
5:56 I'm part Italian!!!!!
Zach: do you think I would be a good husband
Ned:yes 
(sorry I forget his name but here I go) He's lying
Me: Burts out lying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"God Hates Liars And I Hate Liars" He's Lying
You can beat polygraph machines. They record things like heartbeat and if you keep your cool you can beat them, and sometimes they can think you are lying if you are simply nervous
I ship Eugene and Zac so hard
Lying makes you go to hell.
Poor Italian baby boat 😭
Keith saying "we gotta be better about that" made me smile
John should be the next try guy
polygraph is fake
'a boat.. full of newborn italian babies-'
'aww'
'oR! a boat with your wife'
"I'll kill you right here"



"John if you could save your wife, or-or a boat full of orphans, would you? 


"...I'd kill her"
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" 😂😂😂😂
How can Keith not like pillow humping bean??!!!?!!!
Lol John is awesome
John is god.
YOU CAN TELL KEITH REALLY WANTS TO GET FUCKED BY EUGUNE
When Ned kept on talking about John the lie detector dude I thought he was going to be strangled like Homer Simpson strangles Bart.
8:20 I'll kill you right here
Why would John hate lies, without lies John wouldn't have a job
oh my god.
these things are so inaccurate tho
Don't read my name
John is so intense I love it
KEEP JOHN AT ALL DEF DIGITAL SMH
I bet John works at Buzzfeed and they did not even turn on a laptop.
John so scary
best video in awhile
John is so serious during this video
0:30 oh my god
I literally cannot take this test I lie all the time I'm shook
Hahaha "Everything's a toy if you play with it." 
I gotta say tho, out of all the tryguys Keith is my least favourite.
ned is most likely to go on a killing spree from the try guys the darkness in his eye when he says i dont know those babies
These things have proven to be faulty AF but it's still always fun to watch non-criminals take them lol
"God hates liars and I hate liars" lolol
Eugene is the best lololol, his hair is on point as usual~
i'm crying. xD
John hates lieing, I am now a potential contestant to be murdured
This is honestly the only series keeping buzzfeed alive
Keith is NOT the best try guy. Keith is NOT the funniest try guy. and that's the cold hard truth.
Everybody here feeling bad for Eugene while I'm Eugene 😔😂
Polygraphs don't actually work for lie detecting, it just detects heart rate and other stuff like that, but the changes aren't necessarily directly correlated to lying 😒
" I'll kill you right here"
Johns a little snitch. Damn john. come on john.
My favorite try guy is Eugene.
Where did Ned's hairline go?
God hates liars and I hate liars
Polygraphs  are just pseudoscience. Even the inventor hated them
y'all do know how awfully flawed these machines are, right?
"I will kill you right here" 😂
Aaand now I'm shipping Eugene and Zach
John is so emotionless I want a whole series on just him
Eugene looking daddy as usual 💦
John was the best part of this video
I like how Jon is straight faced the entire time 😂😂😂
lie detectors are terrible, they are scientifically proven not to work
even the guy who made them said they shouldnt be used for what they are used for
"Nobody likes nuns Eugene. I grew up catholic" well justified!😂😂😂😂
Ned is my least favorite
John is Terminator
Fine, I'll admit it -- this was actually kinda great, quick and funny. Well done 👏👌🤙
Keith and Grant look so much alike I can't tell them apart sometimes. I was so confused when everyone was calling Grant, Keith. Then I realized it was Keith 😐😂
When Keith says to Ned " I don't need your explanation " I bursted out laughing 😂
Criminals can fake polygraph results if they are really good at it
Lie detectors are actually totally useless and have been proven to be incorrect, if the person who is being "lie detected" can keep a cool head and control their heartbeat they can get away with stuff, but someone who is innocent and is kinda freakin out that they are going to be falsely found guilty, than they can sweat and their heartbeat can speed up and the lie detector can say they are guilty.

That is why it said mr fancy hair was never lying because he kept a cool head and was really just kinda depressing. But he still my favorite, and I'm not trying to hate, I just wanted to write something that someone else besides my  history teacher reads.
"I will kill you right here"  really? You will kill him wow
If you just came from the "try not to rap" video you are out of one in a million
Fucc my stinki pus pus, boaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiii
"I don't know those babies."
bruh Eugene is the Asian verison of josh dun /- l
Did you know?
If you do cardio while taking a lie detector test it would say that you are lieing.

Several serial killers have beaten the lie detector test by staying calm. 

You can take a class to learn how to beat a lie detector.

Fact: 
Lie detectors are old, aweful, and measure, heart rate, blood pressure, sweat, ect. The creator of the polygraph regreted creating the polygraph after seeing what it was used for
These were really interesting questions. Was not expecting them to get that deep. Got shook, fr.
Aw~ all members of Try Guys are awesome. Love them all. ❤️

Aaaw Eugene. Out of all of them, he's definitely the one that's had the rougher life and he's definitely the more closed off one.
"I don't know those babies."
IM SCREAMING
Me watching thus video😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😂😂😂😂
my little heart at the "ugh, we gotta be better with that"
This was so funny I could not help myself.
"god hates liars, and i hate liars"  john is god
Why they got to do each other like that 😂😂
Eugene is smexy af
ned is a bad liar even i can tell he is lying without the machine
JOHN IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL IM LAUGHING SO HARD AT HIS RESPONSES AT EVERYTHING
John is a robot that occasionally murders people
7:44 Zach and Eugene give me life
Zach a hoe
Who hurt John? x'D
I HATE CATHOLICS
Can Quinta and Eugene have babies pls???? Thanks
Why are all polygraph examiners totally emotionless?
John is practically Scruffy from Futurama.
We want John! We want John!
bcuz Kieth is the funniest
Next Episode: The final episode of the Try Guys
"Do you kill the Italian baby boat Ned?"
-Eugene Lee Yang 2017
"I'll kill you right here." 😅
the try hard guys
I was so hoping that at 9:06 Keith was gonna say Keith.
I love John. 😂😂
I lie it
*like 
😂😆😅
You guys realize lie detectors don't actually work right?
OHHH Keith always wanting to be center of attention
Eugene:"its the one thing people said was attractive when I was young"Me in my head:"That can't be true,and if it is then...WOW,he has improved😍
Can someone make the Try Guys go to a haunted place and do a collab with Unsolved?
I don't like john lmfao
lmao I don't think John enjoyed his part in this
to bad polygraph machines don't actually tell if someone is lying. Even the inventor himself denies its validity!
I never wanted this video to end XD
I don't know those baby's
Polygraph Tests don't work
"I'd Kill her" lmao
Lie detector tests are really simple to fake.
I liked a buzz feed video. Welp. Prepare my funeral.
john, welcome to your tape
wasnt john on ADD
Eugene is so hot...
"I like being hooked up to machines..." -Ugene, 2017
The lie guys take a try detector test
john is my spirit animal.
the asian guy is gay
They are fake
Poor John
I thought this was ganna see the validation of a polygraph test.... cuz I'm pretty sure they are slimy accurate
its been proven by the creator of it that its not meant and cant detect lies its detects the patients pulse etc. sweatiness an extremely nervous liar will be caught and many people have been falsely accused and many murderers have been chill and passed it and later been convicted for their crime...
john is my favorite try guy
Zach x Eugene
Jeez, John.
I want to be a polygraph examiner just to hear the tea🐸🍵
I love this! 🤣
To be fair most of us would lie too if we said we would save the babies over someone we love lol, John is so unimpressed 😂 and lets be honest Eugene is the most attractive but I like Keith more :x lol
Literally I would marry zach wtf he's so adorable
when they asked kieth who his favorite try guy was i exoected him to say himself
"God hates liars, I hate liars." That's a lie, according to the Christian faith, God hates no one :)
kieth is the worst for me
Eugene is the best try guy
""I don't know those babies"" Me as Fk
nuns i always scares me
'I don't know those babies' I died😭😂👋🏽
A moment of appreciation for Eugene in formal clothes
"I kill you right here" John was epic. ... do more with him in it!!!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars. I am God here"
Becky will be so proud, Keith. 😂
Lie detectors have been proven to not work multiple times. Look up the studies
Why didn't they ask if they liked John or not? 😂
MAKE JOHN A TRY GUY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 😂😂😂
I just realized that the person who sits, whoever it it, must be in casual clothes lol
It's the same lie detector dude from dr Phil and Maury 😂😂
"It's not a toy."
"Well, everything is a toy if you play with itl
Why do most polygraph people look like they hate life
I love Eugene
0:29 "god hates liars so I hate liars" dude every one on earth has at least lied some time in the life so don't say you hate liars because if you did you would be hating your self
More like the lie guys
This made my day
oh here goes buzzfeed again with the gay Asian dudes...
john is everything
man oh man, these are my favourite guys to watch hands down, their buddy relationship with each other is so darn entertaining lol
When zach said do u think I make a good husband he sounded like a different person
That polygraph examiner do not want to be there 😂😂😂
I want a lesson from Keith on self confidence, make that happen Buzzfeed!
John is my favorite xD
I'll kill you right here 😂😂😂
this and the cheap vs expensive things are the only good thing about this channel.
I thought it was college humour thank you to the Asian guy , wrong channel.
Keith is the best try guy
#SavageJohn
Well isn't he a jolly little ray of sunshine
Nxt week: "The Try Guys Try Gay"
Did Eugene even lie once?
"a boat of newborn italian babies"
"aw"
"or a boat with your wife"

IM PISSING
"He's telling the truth"...I hear that when ever I close my eyes
9:49 the shade in Neds eyes
Eugene really got to me in this.
8:22 lol Jon:I'll kill you right now Ned:Would you kill orphans to save your wife? Jon:I'd kill her
Try guys looks like Mormon.
its awesome on the fact that the polygraph guy name is john . Like just john .Such a basic name . But I think Bob would be better .
"god hates liars and i hate liars"*death stare*
Omg. I wanna see what parts they cut out of the video 😂
the try guys ice skate
Try Guys: "If you had to give up friend chicken for the rest of your life in order to marry your fiancee, would you do it?"
Keith: ".. Yeah."
Try Guys: "WOW!!!"

I'm shooook.
"I'll kill you right now"
i unstan keith he said he doesn't like dogs
I know John needs to keep a poker face, but I feel really intimidated by his seriousness.
Ok so eugenes mom needs to talk about her clairvoyant experiences in one of these videos.
Maybe my favourite try guys video
John took the spotlight with 2 sentences
Dang, making out with 3 coworkers!  Way to go Zach!
they are all so goofy and lovable
Is this the same guy All Def Digital used in their lie detector tests?
4:54

Keith: Do you ever wanna f*ck any of us?
Eugene: No
John: He is lying

Brooo Eugene......
guys if you ask asians if they believe in ghosts, it's very likely they'll say yes because asian ghosts are scary as F !!!!
Did John kill him later???
I'm always curious as to how scripted these are. I would absolutely love it if they were all real and raw. Either way, love these guys!
Ned hurt me @6:15
Only series not cancerous on buzzfeed
I think you guys were throwing John off and he just started guessing 😂
Real question: is John lying?
I don't think I've ever seen Eugene laugh so hard before xD But damn, that "do you know how much we care about you?" question was a heart breaker.
"I'll kill you right now" 


John is a character 😂
"I like being hooked up to machines,"
polygraph tests are pseudoscience
John got me weak when he said I'll kill her😂😂 stone cold murder right there
I love Eugene... How could you not pick Eugene?
Eugene is my favorite
lYING MAKES YOU GO TO HELL
Eugene is the best try guy
Some of these answers were absolutely hilarious oml
I never laughed so hard in my life after seeing Ned be so uncomfortable, especially when john said he'd kill ned
We need to start appreciating just how beautiful Eugene is.
Holy ehit that one question
Since when did Zach's libido get this damn high
John's reaction is lit 😂😂😂
hey can people please subscibe to my channel please. i know i shouldnt self promote but its hard for a youtube channel to get start up
man John is a homie
"God hates liars, and I hate liars. Therefore, I am God."
Omg it's Honest John from ADD
Dear man giving test
God hates liars he also hates me you know why, didn't think so I'll tell you. I'm lesbian, I have two children out of wedlock and one not , I hate some very little but some people , and I've lied before also just saying that was just a few reasons 
                                     Sincerely, Angilina Lepree
"Thought you hated little kiddies" lol 😂
Eugene is soooooooooo hot! Marry me!
Killing nuns is fine? Where is the world going... meanwhile you bend over backwards for islam.
sounds like all the other try guys should put their weiners in keith's mouth.
Lmao the lie detector guy is so funny I didn't think he would be like that hahahaha
John is a psychopath
''God hates liars ,and I hate liars'''
-John
Yeah yeah! Child of divorce, whoop whoop! Jk The feels, Eugene. I gottchu. T.T
I think Eugene actually wants zach, as seen from Try Guys Try UFC Fighting, Eugene says "it feel like Zach might squeal like a little piggy, and that really excites me"
John has no emotion
I like John
John:I will kill you 
I died at that moment.
The old guy is so creepy
Keith needs to learn how to tie a tie.
john is my favorite try guy
Welcome to the Jeremy Kyle show...
Polygraphs don't work.........they really don't a plant gave readings in a polygraph, just stay calm and you'll pass
Polygraphs don't work.........they really don't a plant gave readings in a polygraph, just stay calm
No, consulting the town psychic is not weird.  Geez, Keith.  Okay that was great.  Entertaining, personal, awkward, but yet affirming.  Nice job, gentlemen!
Eugene and Zach? I ship it
Polygraphs don't work
the tester is just kinda sad and loves his machine....
John is basically Ron Swanson lol
ZACCCH XD
Three things that never hide forever; the sun, the moon and the truth
I hope I meet someone like eugine
They stole John from ADD!
I can't believe no one in the comments yet has commented about Eugene and wanting babies. I expected there to be millions.
"i dunno those babies" bahahahaa
polygraph tests are pretty inaccurate but this was still a fantastic video; the comedy makes up for bad technology lol
This was by far the funniest episode of The Try Guys ever!
They ask is your life a lie he says no the guy says he is lying
ok but why do they all look so hot in this video jfc
Is Ned okay? He seemed upset, anxious, worried something......... I dunno...just look out for him. I know I have no idea what goes on in Ned's life but he seemed different, not himself. Was he nervous to do the test I case he got a very personal question, something too personal? It looks like he's gone down a dark path at the moment.
I watched this whole thing with the hugest grin on my face. Love these guys haha.
when Eugene said he didn't know how much the other guys cared about him and Keith said "we've got to be better about that" my heart SWELLED
Eugene  is getting  hotter and hotter in each  video his in ,Eugene is really  hot just saying
"Everythings a toy if you play with it." These are the words I live by.
Everything's a toy if you play with it.
I'm going to use this forever lol
John is my spirit animal
This was hilarious
John was kinda scary XD
This just made me love Eugene more lol
The lie detector guy seems like he'd be the killer in a scary movie O_o
"everything's a toy if you play with it" - zach 2k17
John has zero chill.
The sad part is that the lie detector doesn't work
i don't know those babies
the lie detector guy seems really serious
8:10 - 8:40 I'M DYING!
Eugene made me so sad when they asked "do you know how much you mean to us" and he just automatically said no
NED OMG YOU NEED TO STOP TALKING
god hates liars, and I hate liars



But isn't the people who wrote the Bible are also liars and the book itself is also a lie ~_~
damn the guy working the polygraph was not havin it
Zach, I think you're the best try guy ❤️❤️❤️
I am in love with Zach!
wtf John is so scary
this isn't always accurate, because people could just be nervous, lying or not
i loved every moment of this
John should be the new try guy
My parents are single too
He:Ah, finally. I've waited so long!
She:You want me to leave?
He:No! I dare not even think!
She:Do you love me?
He:Of course! Lots!
She:Have you ever cheated?
He:No. Why are you asking me?
She:Will you kiss me?
He:Yes, every time I get the chance!
She:Will you ever hit me?
He:Are you crazy?! No!
She:Darling?
He:Yes?

Now... Read that from bottom to top!
I feel like the rest of the Try Guys have a "Operation Make Eugene Feel Loved"
I loved the "very personal ones" lol!
My jigga John
"i don't know those babies." with a very monotone voice, he said as he decided to kill a boat of italian babies over his wife.
the poligraph is a crazy test that doesn't prove a thing and it's inadmissible in court.
1,355,421 view 😀😀😀😀
DO A PART 2 ON THIS PLEASE !
That guy brought God into it at the start? 
Well, that ruined it for me
The real liar is the one asking the questions
Try guys are the only reason why I'm still subscribed to buzzfeed.
4:33 shoked me  hahaha zach lied😂
0:28 But isn't it a sin to hate?
But lie detectors don't exactly work if you're taking it right after you do sports right? Or if someone is sweaty and nervous?
"god hates liars and i hate liars"
I love all of them!
"I'll kill you right here." LMAO
Gosh, thanks for letting me come long. That was fun.
7:23 awww eugene bbs
I think it says a lot that everyone chose Keith as their favorite of the group. He must be as funny in real life as he is in the videos
Go to 1:41 captions on
john is one of the best things to come from buzzfeed
How do you not like Bean, Keith?!
how yall stealing John from all def digital. lmao.
Zack looks like a baby. That's probably why he's still single cuz usually women prefer strong manly guys u know
Zack: hey Keith do you like Ned's dog
Keith: No
Ned: What
John: Keith is telling the truth
Ned: No
Keith: I don't like any dog
Ned: do you like Eugene's dog 
Keith: I do like Eugene's dog
Ned: Welcome to your tape
ned and ariel are the cutest
OMFG God and John, the same person. America f*ck yeah!!!
John: "I'll kill you right here."
"Would you rather sink a boat full of newborn Italian babies or a boat with Ariel in it?" 
Ned: "I don't know those babies"
The Italian baby boat
Eugene's answers are highkey sad
I thought polygraph only worked best with yes and no answers
Werent these things debunked and known to not actually be able to detect if they are lying?
XD What the Frag?!
"Do you think you have a better marriage than john?"

Ned: yea I guess so he's older and the marriages get to weaken a little 

John: I will kill you right here 

I was dying 😂😂
Zach looks so good in this I mean they all do but like. Zach this is a good look
"god hates liars...and i hate liars."

well...that escalated quickly
This actually is my favourite thing the Try Guys have done!
"not a toy..."
"well, everything is a toy if you play with it..."

OOOOHHH MY GOODDDDD SHOOOTSS FIRE AIRHORNS YOUVE BEN SERVED HOLLY TRUPLE.
In the Try Guys Try Sexy drinks video Eugene said "One Day" in response to Zach having a fuckable body... Next try guy video...
I'm like Eugene, I keep too many secrets.
Is no one talking about the real MVP here, John
A lie detector is fake its rates how neverous you are
yygffftt Uuuuquelash ytgtg
i love how eugene  is so calm 😂
MORE JOHN <3
"I'd kill her..." continues to sit there emotionless
LMAO KEITHS LAST QUESTION BYEE
zack was too sexy in this video, get out
johns enthusiasm makes this video perfect 👌👌
Someone should have asked Eugene if he's gay.
Can we just take a moment for that guy that was saying if it was true not 😇
John seemed excited :')
I'm so happy this is posted on my birthday! 😊💕
''God hates lairs and i hate lairs''
Eugene is my favorite if I'm not lying

Lu is telling the truth
I lie to protect myself
it makes me sad to hear Eugene say he was told he was unattractive..bet those girls are eating their words now cause hes hot.
I loved this lol
John is scary af
That Old Man Is Grumpy. I Don't Like Him.


Fell!Smol Jammy Is Telling The Truth
Oh Eugene
"You psycho don't applaud him!"😂😂😂😂😂
God does not hate lairs God loves all but that does not mean their not doing anything wrong.
Eugene doesnt believe in true love :(
ahhhhh I love Eugene soo much omf
Great video I liked it. :)
if you put it on subtitles every he says keith is lying it shows up key fish line😂😂😂😂
"So apparently I wanna f_ck Zach"


I can hear the fanfictions...

Keith is the best
Check it out, its a database of those leaks and u can search by username https://sites.google.com/site/snapleakswiki/

Have you guys ever heard of them apps that some people use to
This is the most intense try guys video ever
He's telling the truth
Zach is my baby 😍
you can not trust a polygraph
John, looks over "I'll kill you right now." Had me dying.
John is my current mood
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 😂
My favorite episode
if this was a polygraph test you could not trust the polygraph
is lie-detector test fully real? I heard it goes according to your stress level. If its going by stress level i don't think it fully correct
iM CRYIG THIS IS SO FUNNY
i love how ned kept digging a hole deeper and deeper for himself. i literally died 2 times rewatching that LOL then jon freaking dumps his wife for a boat of random babies. how noble
No offense but polygraphs aren't reliable at ALL. But the try guys right? xD
I knew Ned would save his wife....he always talks about her.
im questioning my sexuality now cuz eugenes just so good looking
"I don't know those babies" 
Nedd you scare me :P
omg this has to be number 1 in trending!!
This was genuinely so good
I felt so sad during Eugene's questioning...
John is my favorite try guy
I was ok edge the whole video
Eugene is so depressed but atleast we know he has fun in his job , he has always been my fav from buzzfeed and ,, the hottest 🌚🌚🌚
Lol lie detector test are fake IF YOUR PRESSURED YOUR LYING IF YOUR CHILL YOUR NOT!!!
Oh my jesus....
"Everything's a toy if you play w it"
6:09 in the background
and I hate you John you're a liar polygraph are fake
THIS WAS THE BEST IDEA FOR A TRY GUYS EPISODE EVERVVRERR
"God hates liars,and I hate liars" oh man john, someone must've really hurt you in the past
"god hates liars, and i hate liars" who hurt you john?
Rip their friendship 😂😜
It's not lying if you don't say anything at all. If your boyfriend is cheating on you and I say he's not, it's lying, but if I say nothing, it's not
"God hates liars and I hate liars." Woah shook
"God hates liars and I hate liars."
Dammit Keith! 😂
this moment was majestic 7:40
How does Eugene look so pretty?
all of them look ridiculously attractive on this video. 



that is to say, more so than normal  (somehow)
Why do they all like Keith the best? I find him pretty annoying at times...
more
Eugene the best try guy in my opinion
they make me believe in love some of their questions and answers were so cute
Lie detectors dont work.
"God hates liars..."

Wow... too bad for you sparky that the lie detector can be easily defeated, and was called a Frankenstein monster by its own creator.  It doesn't detect truth... It's old timey pseudoscience
8:19 IM DYIN, why is this me with people I hate
The try guys should try planning a wedding...my mom went through that and it was hell
Eugene is my favorite Try Guy
OMG! I think I'm in love with this video! it was reallly awesome
This is making my anxiety flare up 
UGGGHHHHH It's so hard to watch >_< Believe in me guys!! ;-;
I thought it said "The lie guys"
"...I'd kill her"

JOHN WINS EVERYTHING HE'S SO FUNNY
eugene is my favorite
John sounded so depressed :p
I don't know those babies
Ned: "Keith let's talk about becky" 
keith: instantly smiles 
awwww 😂❤
"i don't know those babies" i can't stop laughing
Eugene wants children?...sign me up.
Keith do you think you better looking than Ned
Keith: yes
operator:he is telling the truth. im not even reading the polygraph
fuckboy zach in the house
part 2 please!
John reminds me of Ron Swanson
John looks so done. Like : "you cannot shock me. I heard all the lies and know all the dark secrets"
im telling the truth
Lie detectors mainly just detect if they have any nervous spikes
So if they r nervous it may be wrong
Lie detectors mainly just detect if they have any nervous spikes
So if they r nervous it may be wrong
Everybody Loves Keith.
I was dying at John! He was so serious 😂😂
I love John.
"I will kill you right now" John is a Savage
Everytime I see Zach I think of a face on his butt.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"... Yeesh that guy is intense!!!
See I'd never be good at this because I get nervous telling the truth and telling a lie
did you know that you can actually beat a lie detector test by being chill 





I aint lying
John is scary
Zach: Well anything you play with is a toy .

hmmm that's deep
Lowkey shipping Eugene and Zach now XD
eugene wanna marry me? k thanks buddo
Ned's a cuck
It is very easy to fake lie detector tests
Do you like neds dog no do you like eugenes dog yes he's telling the truth
Fake lie detector
adam ruins the polygraph college humor. watch it bruh
The dude behind the computer is really creeping me out
Zach: Do you think I'll ever find love?
Keith:Yeah
"He's lying"
If I was a try guy and they said who's you favorite of us I would say "Me"
H E  I S  T E L L I N G  T H E  T R U T H
"I don't know those babies"😂
5:23 All the Zack/ Eugene shippers come out of the woodwork
john scares me
I just choked on my drink thanks buzzfeed...
Aren't lie detectors entirely inaccurate
They should have brainstormed better questions...
lie detectors can be wrong. you can get stressed about some questions even if you are not lying. you can also trick them if you learn to control your stress response. also, if you believe what you're saying is true, even if it isn't, it could show up as truth.
All Ned talks about is his wife
i am so in love with zach is disgusting
Keith: I don't like any dogs
Ned: Do you like Eugene's dog?
Keith: I do like Eugene's dog.
I'm crying my poor baby Eugene
Wenger out
Hey I'll be the new black try guy! Or a polygrapher...
who lied to John man???
Lie detector tests read the change in heart rate when someone is asked a question.I'm assuming they simply skipped showing  us them being asked neutral questions that would serve as a baseline for what their normal heart rate is when asked a question. 

It seemed more like John was observing their change in pitch (if their voices went higher as the lied, etc), especially when it came to them answering questions that weren't yes/no- than actually relying on the lie detector (though it is possible that, like I said, that they didn't show them setting the baseline). 

Either way, the Try Guys were hella' entertaining and it was another great video.
We need more of these videos omg I love them😂❤
I like nuns...TRUTH
Awww 
"Eugene do you want to have children?"
"Yes."
"He's telling the truth." 
I'm like I'll have your children Eugene ❤️😂
WHEN JOHN JUST LOOKED AT NED AND I JUST I CAN'T BREATHE I'M LAUGHING SO HARD LMAOOOOOOOO
the lie detector is really creepy!
Try Guys need their own channel tbh
Is anybody else bothered by the fact that the polygraph has proven notoriously unreliable in the past?
😂🤣😂🤣
i swear i think eugene could get away with everything because he's so good at being truthful i don't know.
"I'll kill you right here." I died. My funeral is tomorrow.
Why is the lie detector guy so serious omg
LYING MAKES YOU GO TO HELL!
Eugene is very attractive😞
Johns my spirt animal
"i dont know those babies"
I feel bad for laughing when Ned said he'd kill the babies and his reason was "I don't know those babies"
Such beta cucks
Soooo zach made out with all the try guys and no one caught that😳👀...
Try Guys
psshhhhh
More like... Lie Guys
amiright! No... Oh, okay
Eugene I'm willing to have children with you
The lie detector is probably fake anyway, if someone was super nervous, sweaty, fast heart beart, and said that 2+2 is true, the detector would probably show a lie.
John is a savage lol
The guy doing the test is like: god hates liars and I hate liars
Guy doing tests: is god real
Guy: no
Guy doing tests: looks at polygraph that says he isn't lying he's lying!
Guy: he's lying
#fuckedbyyourownshit
Lie detector tests do not work. I thought everybody knows that !
Im pretty sure thats john from add channel 😂😂
That guy is grumpyyyyyyy
Eugene's face after the kids question 👍👌✔
Oh poor John I feel bad for him :)
John is so serious geez
Keith: "Bob can I have four."
He's name is John 😂
You could take a gallon of water that John's wife is drowning in by just posting this hashtag on your twitter and spreading and sharing it.
       
      Post #savejohnswife now
Lie detectors do not detect lies. They are useful as tools to extract confessions, and that's about it.
Of course there needs to be a black try guy!
😂69k
"Keith do you like Ned's dog?" I understood Ned Stark
WE NEED TO KNOW EUGENE'S SECRETS !!😂😂
I've never laughed so much, "I'll kill you right here."
That's it john is the new try guy
I always wanted to do this with my soon to be ex wife.
this is sooooo funny..😂
MORE OF THIS PLEASE!!!
DO THIS AGGGGAAAAIIIINNNNN!!!!!!!!!
You guys should go watch my YouTube videos I post daily and u won't regret it I posted a challenge just now go watch ili🤗
Why is john so solemn
should of asked if he loves his wife
"I don't know those babies" -Ned😂😂
Keith is me honestly
I like John 😂
John is intense
lie detectors don't work
Zach x Eugene boiz
"I don't know those babies"
I love John he's on All Def Digital too 😂
Ah, the good ol' polygraph. So unreliable, even the inventor of it said it's garbage.
Annnnnd now I ship Zack and Eugene
They should've asked Eugene if he head a crush... maybe on a person named Quinta😘😏
god hates liers and i hate liers... jesus that dude is dark af
Keith is the funniest
"That was great, I like being hooked up to machines"

Please, tell me more, Eugene...
It sucks that polygraphs don't actually work, or else this video would be cool
So the truth is that Zach is the F*ckboy of Buzzfeed??? 😂😂😂
This was so interesting to watch!
Zack, you're not single, silly, you're my boyfriend
What post-war is Eugene talking about in Korea?? Didn't the two sides split in like 1950.
Eugene doesn't get enough credit. Truly appreciate his work.
lie detecters are fake right
"I don't know those babies."
lie detecters are fake...or are they
lie detecters are fake...or are they
I don't think Eugene is actually sexually attracted to any of the try guys. Just had a sex dream after eating too much. We've all had them.  :S
Im pretty sure i would fail any lie detector test because of how nervous i would be
THEY SHOULD OF ASKED IF HE EVER CHEATED ON HIS WIFE😂😂😂
It's a polygraph not a lie detector. Polygraphs are ineffective pieces of junk that are easily tricked.
ok sorry but I have to say it: Zac looked pretty hot in this video
Eugene and Keith r tied for the best try guy
They look like characters from Mass Effect: Andromeda.
John seems like a lovely man
Gay cunts I'm black so you can't say any thing
He is a terrifying man.
This is so funny
This was so intense
I think John is kinda satanic or apart of the Westboro Baptist chruch
This was so intense
that dog part was too much
This guy is so done with life omg :D
This was really interesting!
Im a simple gal with simple interests, I see the try guys, I hit like
johns scary
Zach: Do you want to have kids?
Eugene: Yes
Me: I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE 😂❤
My main thought when clicking to watch this was they're going to ask Ned about his wife and I need to know if he's lying.
'I don't know those babies.'
~Ned justifying killing babies and my yearbook quote
Keith is such a G he told the truth throughout like all of it
KEITH
The Best TryGuy
Them: "Which one of us is your favorite"
Me: "... John"
I ship Zach and Eugene... who's with me?
OHHHH SNAAAPPP
Oooo
Also I want to be hooked up to a lie detector and see how good or bad I am xp
"God hates liars and I hate liars." Alright dude XD
😂😂😂😂😂
Try guys  you're going down especially Ned John says he'll kill you right here don't kill the most attractive guys on YouTube that make me laugh John please don't 😧😂😂😂😂🤗😍😘😋😉😊😜😝😛😀😄
Poor John
"I don't know those babies."
Can we get a movie version of this
When you watch this video and see jhons face it like this the  hole time😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
The Try Guys try suicide
Eugene is so handsome and truely amazing I wish he knew this 😭
If Eugene met me then he would believe in true love lmfao
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SHIPS EUGENE WITH ZACH
Why try guys why?! I'm sitting here with my face mask on, trying to get my beauty on, trying to keep from laughing...but u just had to be so damn funny😡🤦‍♀️😩 I can feeel it cracking as I'm cracking up. Not cool guys, not cool. 

Ps. I love u anyway. Especially u Eugene. If I lived in the US I'd probably stalk u to death ❤️xoxo
Why the hell does Eugene have Tom Riddle's hair cut?
I see John switched from ADD to Buzzfeed
When john was saying "god hates liars" I thought he was gonna say "god hates liars and I hate god"
...😅
"I'd kill her" 😂😂my gave try guy
Really wish I had one of those things, I hardly ever know if I'm lying or not >_>

Edit: I mean, I could be lying right now, I don't know!
eugene doesn't believe in true love because his parents are divorced? I think that's just how it is with all of us kids with separate perents
I SHIP EUGENE AND ZACH TOGETHER FROM THE VERY FISRT TRY GUYS EPISODE MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"I like being hooked up with a machine"
The best video I have ever watched
0:28 you're obviously lying john because god isn't real ;)
The divorce part hit home. It truly does mess with your head!
I LOVED THIS VIDEO LMAO <3 :)
I loved this and Keith is also my favourite try guy
Lying makes you go to hell
It's a terrible detection of lying and has been proven wrong many a time in the future
that was amazing
Best video in a long time buzzfeed
John is high key the only person i have ever seen doing lie detector test.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars" omg ok
Is that AllDefDigitals polygraph guy?
"I like being hooked up to machines"        - Eugene2017😂😂👌
I like John. He's cool.
I want to be one of the try guys
"I don't know those babies." 
Mood
It's because Ned and Keith are dominant and they think they are the best
John seems a bit...scary as in like he could kill with the right motive
"God hates liers and I hate liers" so john is god
"I don't know any of those babies"
"God hate liers And i hate liers to!" 

John is god
I had a dream yesterday.the try guys were in it for entertaining purposes (nth dirty ;)   ) ,and I was pointing at Eugene sayin he's my fav .,well better than the supernatural and complicated stuff I usually dream of .
When Eugene went, it just got darker a little bit...
Actually, polygraphs aren't reliable lie detectors
John is the legend27
That John dude makes me crack up
Best episode ever. John is hot.
They copied the ADD channel
It's a nervous detector. But it's damn good fun when it's not serious.
I love these longer videos
funniest try guys video
Pollygraphs are fake.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars'... dayyyyum! I'd like to hook every one of my ex boyfriends up to your lie machine, is there an auto-kill electrocution option attached to it?
john seemed so grumpy.



"hes telling the truth."
0:28 "God hates liars and I hate liars" therefore John is God
john is awsome
john is literally me😂💀
So what about one for the females? To bad can't with certain females because there gone.😐
I love this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He sounds internally depressed....(the guy who said he is lying)
Lie detectors are 100% accurate. There's no reason for a suspect to feel anxious even when they're innocent when they're hooked up to a machine that measures their blood pressure and generally are used in situations where is quite extreme where they need to find a culprit for a crime, etc. So do be nervous, because if you do, you'll likely face some jail time or worse, no pressure or anything.
9998,385th viewer arty over hhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeerrrrrreeeeeeeeee wwoooooooooooooooooooohhhhooooo!
I love John oh my god
LMAO Zach's laugh at 1:09. He sounds like a little school girl.
When you start to notice all of the touching between Zach and Eugene.
Ned looks like a dad lol
I'm Jon
I'm not a gangster, fool
Cause I follow all the rules
I play ping pong and pool

I don't disrespect authority
Or go against majority
Let's face it
My momma is my number one priority

I like Sarah Palin
There's no chicks that I'm nailing
And you'll never catch me failing
Cause I'm sailing through school

I'm white
I'm really, really white
I'm so pale I practically get sunburnt at night

Hey, where you at?
Put your hands in the air
I got a big black comb for my white boy hair

So don't expect me to be nice
I spread like lice
I'm colder than cold
I froze Vanilla Ice

My name is Paint
The lyrical saint
I got too many girls, I wanna file a complaint

I'm 19, although I look like I'm 9
But I pick my women like fruit off the vine
I make guys jealous, and I make girls squeal
That's a lie, I got no sex appeal

So I don't care if you hate me
Girls already don't date me
So go click SUBSCRIBE and don't forget to rate me
Eugene/Zach slash fanfiction. Somebody write it and link me.
Buzzfeed is litterally nothing without the try guys, who agrees?
Buzzfeed sucks
you forgot to censor the f word in there
John is the best 😂😂😂
Thats the same guy that does alldefditigal lie detectors
lmao, John is awesome. "..................I'll kill her"
Part 2!
Omg John is cheating of AllDefDigital with Buzzfeed
my name is john
Who's interested to see them put their "plus size" co workers in front of them and see their true thoughts on the way they look or are they just told to say it? It'd also be interesting if they test they guys beliefs in "white privilege", and "minority oppression". I'd love to see if they really think these things or if it's just show for Buzzfeed.
Eugene doesn't believe in true love but he believes in ghosts...
Eugene and Zack ok
when you've always been shipping Zach and Eugene :^)
Anyone else thought John is like Ron Swanson???
"I don't know those babies" LMAO
It's already been proven that lie detector tests don't really work.
Lie detectors don't work.
Eugene is the guy you'd read about in most high school romance books on Wattpad
Step 1- kiss the palm of your hand. 
Step 2- say your crushes name. 
Step 3- close your hand. 
Step 4- say a week day. (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday....etc)
Step 5- say your name. 
Step 6- open your hand.
Step 7- repost this 6 times.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."
Uhm, excuse me, r u God?
when lie detecters dont work but you need the money
Ned-"I don't know these babies."
am I the only one who thinks John is actually Ron Swanson
"I don't know those babies"
Damn.. John is depressing lmao
"And I hate liars."
He must have hated everybody in this world...
can John be a try guy?
💕Awwww, Eugene! Let's be insecure together!💕
the look john gave him
i am john
God doesnt hate liers he hates sins
This is the best video I've ever seen
I'd give $10,000 for that lie detector thing
Lie detectors are ineffective and a waste of money.
lie detectors don't even work though
Plz make the try guys play ouija board or how it's spelled
god doesn't hate liars he just is upset
"Everything is a toy if you play with it"
If it asked me if I was gay I would be fucked
I WILL BE YOUR WIFE AND SEX LADY EUGENEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
wow, john seems so... excited...
Eugene asking Keith about fitting penises in his mouth 😂 i love that they don't have any filter
Eugene asking Keith about fitting penises in his mouth 😂 i love that they don't have any filter
We need more john.
'I LIKE BEING HOOKED UP TO MACHINES'
"I lie, I lie A LOT, but if you ask me a direct question, I'll give you a direct answer." is Zach a Sagittarius/Leo? 💀
Sure lie detectors are fake but that guy doing the test is amazing
John looks so done.
why are questions soo gay
GOD HATES LIARS AND I HATE LIARS
I think John must be the father of the 3 boys on Mean Girls 😂
Is John the only polygraph examiner ever? He's in every polygraph video ever
Isn't this the same guy from ADD
Poor John 😞 💔 😭
4:20 and Mex people
Did you know the polygraph doesnt actually work they are just used to intimidate p oeople into telling  the truth
Zach: Do you think I'm ever gonna find love?
Keith: ...Yeah...
John: Keith is lying 

LMAO😂😂😂😂
People do know that polygraphs don't actually work right?
Ned doesn't even need a lie detector, he sucks at lying
if you believe in mythical things what's stopping you from believing in true love
John is so creepy...I love it!
"A lot of women died so we had to use the physic"
"God hate liars and I hate liars" Are you implying that you are god John???
this is the best omg
Lie detectors aren't actually incredibly scientifically based.  They fail a lot.
Can John be a permanent addition???
I vote to add John to the Try Guys.
"I like being hooked on machines" LOL
OMG!!!! MY HEART FLUTTERED THE MOMENT THEY ASK EUGENE IF HE WANTED CHILDREN!!!!!!!
poor john
God does not hate liars. God loves us for who we are.
so everybody loves Keith and Keith loves Zach?
Swear I need to hire John... he is a Polygraph Examiner Celebrity.
The Try guys are average but the best try guy by far is John
This was heart breaking 💔 😭
HOLYSHIIIIIET
"God hates liars and I hate liars" is John implying he's god?
John should be apart of the try guys
I loved this 😂😂
I resonate with Eugene.
these guys are weird lol.
Eugene doesn't believe in true love. High five!
That man carrying out the test is serious 😂
John turned out to be funnier than I thought.
basicly today we learned that the tryguys are all gay(actually no that was pretty obvious, but we learned they had sex 
 between eachother)
John was taking no crap today
where did you find the guy... he is hilarious. i would love to see him in some other videos
This is a great vide * Adam comes out of nowhere * Well........
I kept hearing "keef" whenever they tried saying keiths name lol
Go to 8:20 it's the best thing ever
Zach don't belive him!!! You going to find love!!!!!
cockdick
0:30 ugh I can't escape them
john is so great what is his ig "I'd kill my wife" "I'll kill you right here" "God hates liers and I hate liers"
polygraph tests are very inaccurate
What is 1+1? "2" LIE
LOL whatch Adam ruins everything on polygraph
#JohnForFifthTryGuy2k17
John is god🙏🏻🙏🏻
-_- he is telling the truth...
"We should have a black member"............ Trump 2017
Am I the only one who would love to see some try guys comments reaction or smth like that?😣
I like John
"God hated liars, I hate liars" *alarm goes off for lying*
"God hates liars and I hate liars" John is god
lie detectors are so ineffective, but SO fun
The polygraph guy has the best pokerface ever
"I don't know those babies."😂
favorite episode ever
What about Adam ruins everything about the polygraph tests?
Zaaach 😍😍😊😍😍
are they all gay?
They all look so hot in those shirts and ties omg 😂
what's up with buzzfeed and lie detector tests?
John should be a try guy
John is the best Try Guy
ive always lo-key shipped Zach and Eugene but now im SHIPPING
😂😂😂😂 No one rates Zach
Eugene you break and swell my heart 💔❤️
I didn't expect Eugene to be so insecure about his appearance. And that only his hair made him feel like he was just enough. I think he is a good looking guy, and pretty cute. He is 15 years older than me, almost twice my age (I'm 16) but I am entitled to have an opinion right? 😂😂
I hate people who lied if they liked this vid because of some reason.... like if u agree
All Def Digital..........
This is a pretty funny episode but it might as well just be like 'never have I ever' because it's not like polygraphs actually work.
Eugene trying to hide his laughs is the cutest thing in the world
I'll kill you right there
There is no god, it's nothing but a big lie, it's 21th century old man, keep up already
Zach and Eugene are the cutest thing
"I don't know those babies"😂😂😂
John seems like he's seen some stuff.
THE MAN CREEPS ME OUT HELLPPPPPP
0:27 but god isn't real.
"i dont know those babies"
idk those babies- Ned
"I'll kill u right now" 
LMAO😂😂
polygraph dosnt work
jon has no emotion
I wanna marry Zach 😁❤
I Love Eugene. 💙💚💛💜
Damn... John will be the new Lie Detector killer 😂also such a savage
MORE OF JOHN
I love John
you guys know this is a joke and lie detectors literally have been proven useless like 30 years ago or something
I feel like they should get their own channel! Like ladylike! Just me?
BRUH the lie detectors are not detecting lies. There detecting how nervous and there heart beat and that is what it is detecting. I'm sorry but it's not real people.
Honestly lie detectors are all frauds in a way. Lies are too complicated for a little machine to read accurately. I would be read as lying half the time because I'm nervous and anxious af even when telling the truth
John wouldn't  like me cuz I lie a lot for the good
Why does Zach have a lollipop 🍭
this is one of the best videos i've ever seen 😂😂
I ship Eugene with Zach
Zach has totally made out with Kelsey, I'm calling it now.
... Keith is my favorite, too.
The people controlling those things are always dicks😂
Easy way to beat the polygraph test is to completely ignore the questions and make up your own questions and so the answers would seem random and inconsistent.
That guy is creepy this tech is not out yet
"Well everything's a toy when you play with it." Zach get a girlfriend 😂 actually don't, well maybe..
johns death threats.... he has serious problems i dont think he is even joking - since he said he hates liars .....i think he looks like a depressed peedo
THIS WAS SO FKN COOOL
3:44 
eugene: yup... does some stuff to ur brain guys. 

well... he ain't wrong
noooo the Italian babies :'D
I clicked of the video as soon as he said "god hates liars"
This was awesome 😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is literally the best Try Guys video. I was dying
Love that they were carrying coffee. So funny!
Why are Ned, Eugene, and Zach dressed like extras from the Book Of Mormon?
Euzach... Zene... Zeuch... Zagene... It's hard to find a ship name
Either John is really funny or really dangerous.
aren't polygraphs unreliable alotta times, people being nervous can also cause the machine to think the person's lying..?
DAMN ZACK!!!! THREE!?!?!?!?!
An actually good buzzfeed video
#JohnAsANewTryGuy
Who else thinks John should join the try guys?
"nobody likes nuns" especially if you went to catholic school that allows corporal punishment. They old but they strong.
Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off
Ned was definitely offended when Eugene was asked the divorce question...
I LOVE JOHN
the beard guy is super serious
I am so tired of Eugene's sob story what an asian baby!
John may kill Ned.
This lie detector man needs to have some humor and smile god damn
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" that's why Zach is single 😂😂😂😭😭
Eugene is the most honest but he had some honestys that were kinda sad because like the one where he doesn't believe in true love that is sad 😪😢😥
well, Keith is funnier than all 3 of them combined, so... he's not wrong there
"I don't know those babies."
do u think that is weird?

no 

hes telling the truth

WELL it is!
I would really like if the Try Guys put like 1 hour video ! I won't mind , i never get enough of them
AMAZING 10/10 AWESOME THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES
0:28 'God hates liars and I hate liars,' does that mean he is God? O_O
Yo if you need a black Try Guy just tell me where to send my resume.
ASAINs want so many grand children and Mexicans I'm ASAIN and my parents have 6 kids including me
john gives me the creeps
"I don't know those babies!!"
I understood "Ned Stark" instead of "Ned's Dog" and was a bit confused why this would be considered a very personal question
0:30 JOHN HAS SPOKEN
ngl I would watch a sequel this was the best try guys video I've seen
Damn Zach was looking good in that shirt and tie!!🙌
When Ned said, "I don't know those babies" 😂
Polygraphs aren't aways correct when you are nervous afraid mad or sexually aroused it shows a spike in the polygraph
8:15 to 8:35 just 😂
This confirms the Eugene-Zach ship.
john seems sketchy
....
These guys are adorable hhhhhhh
Their laugh!
The moment the guys where like WOWOWOWOW when Keith gave up his fried chicken for his wife
( 8:19 )
John: I will kill you right here 
Ned. :would you rather save    
           your wife or a boat full
           of orphans 
Jhon:...I'd kill her
Me😂😂😂😂😂
Zach at 1:10 with a lollipop and giggling 😹😹
JOHN IS A SAVAGE
Ariel is bae💙
EUGENE I love you!!!!! You're the best try guy
john looks like he his hating ever moment.
Can John please join the try guys? 😂😂
Polygraphs are pseudoscience
ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING-forensic science
John made me laugh so hard!
7:05 Ned or Will Arnett?
That man john is my hero.
Lie Detector Tests are pure bunk. With enough will, you can easily fool a lie detector test.

Go watch Adam Ruins Everything about Forensic Science.
Polygraphs have been proven to be incredibly inaccurate for lie detecting. There a bunch of factors that would effect polygraphs such as nervousness. Even myth busters talked about this
Eugene is the best Try Guy
why is Zach sucking on a damn lollipop? :)
Keith jajajajaj secos que buenas preguntas, cuanta sinceridad en un video xD
Haha
Add John to the try guys XD
Lie detectors are inacurate
Amazing
Polygraph tests aren't always accurate
MA BOI JOHN'S BACK AT IT AGAIN 😂😂
he's like the guy from 12 Cloverfield Lane
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 
Are you God?
I think Keith is the best as well....
"Aww" to "I don't know those babies" in seconds Hahahhaa
John is my spirit animal. He also reminds me of Ron Swanson from Parks and Rec
the lie detectos is pretty useless, you will find out
John is my spirit animal
i remember watching thisba year ago... dafuq?
Everything is a toy if you play with it.
trash "science"
Johns a savage MothaFucka Jesus Christ 😂😂😂
Zach: "Will I ever find love?"
Keith: "Yeah!"
Lie detector dude: "He's lying"
Me: bursts out laughing
But seriously: is John a robot?
Lol I love John
John be so damn serious!
Is your hair the product of all your insecurities?
LOL
That was funny 😂 lol
John = god.
That's the same guy from All Def digital!
I have such a huge crush on Zach <3
I don't think anyone could not like Keith.
Poor Eugene. One day Eugene will be in love and be so protective like Ned. Gosh dang it Eugene is hot because he's the one who hates everything and is the mysterious one. I just love them all though
This video is so funny XD
lmao john is amazing
The sweat detector i call it.
you should do a part 2!!
Man turns his head slowly "I'll kill you right there" death glare
they shoulda done this when they tasted trumps food 😏
eugene loves bieng hooked up to machines cause he doesent get a realy machine
Its sooo creepy how he says "hes telling the truth" or "hes lying"
lie detectors don't actually work
Dont Read My Profile Pic ;) Seriously Don't!
that guy running  the test was an add
you know Ned's wife giving him a good time tonight after those answers
Lie detectors don't even work... :D
Buzzfeed still trying to ruin relationships 😂
7:14 THAT IS BRUTAL! Damn Keith...
John's definitely the best try guy lmao😂
That dude John (the polygraph examiner) may hate liars, but God doesn't. God loves everyone! He just deeply hates sin, and lying is a sin... Just saying
Lie detectors aren't accurate 

Go watch Adam ruins everything
John to be a new try guy petition?
Can't wait until there's gonna be little Eugenes running around with great hair
O hhhhhhahajssks
This is not a valuable source of information even the inventor of the lie detector said he regrets making that contraption. Plus humans are way more complicated than that! What the lie detector does is it looks at blood pressure,sweat, heart rate, etc etc but people could just be nervous of the results and just be a guy who came back from working out. There are killers in the past who have been tested and succeeded on not getting caught.
Polygraph tests are not accurate.
I love this one
I love this. they HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN!
can i just hug eugene tho like this killed me
Why did they act so surprised when they if Keith would give up fried chicken for the love of his life?
Eugene is by far the best try guy....imo
H e ' s     l y i n g
and then they broke up after this
This was the most entertaining video I've seen in a while
isn't John the dude from ADD?
its robtop
6:48 Eugine you're attractive! Even without the hair you'd be attractive! He has charisma and a nice face structure, eyes and basically everything.
That John guy really scares me ...I really hope he is joking.
eugene pls make a child of divorce video!!!!
do people know that lie detectors don't even work?
i dont believe in this lie detector thing
I don't know if I love John or if I'm absolutely terrified of him...😂
God doesn't hate liars. God doesn't hate anyone.
It's not a toy? Then why are you doing this video?
John is soooo creepy its funny
Isn't that John from ADD's "Pretty Girls Are Shallow?" Video?
If you hate liars, why are you administering polygraphs? They're not a lie detecting device, liar.
John: God hates liars 
Me: I'm sorry I thought God loved everyone 
Also me: religion is fucked
I need one of these... I can't believe people
"I'll kill you right here"
lmao!!
I'd fail a lie test any day, I'd get nervous and nobody would believe me
I LOST IT AT 7:35, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S FACE TO LOOK AT
John is done with all of them
Except that polygraph tests don't work if you are calm
the lie detector dude's voice is perfect for this
Eugene..I feel for you
surprised there wasn't more sexual questions😂
Eugène is sexy
I love john lmao
Put John in more of your videos PLEASE.
Yeah TTG are back! Miss them on Buzzfeed
Zach's chest hair is so much its even on my screen.
I feel like you learn a lot from this :D
I love Eugene and his insecurities. Is that weird? proabably. oh well.
this is by far the best video of the try guys. absolutely my fav! 😍
"Every things a toy if you play with it"- Zack 18+
Zack baby boy u playa
"God hates liars and I hate liars."

That guy puts the fear into me
"I'd killer her"
Everyone loves Keith 😂
god hates liars and i hate liars
was this kinda sad to anyone?
I wanna do this with my friends lol
"everything's a toy when you play with it" my favorite line XD
haha this is the same lie detector guy from ADD!
I liked this video before it started Wtf
this was hilarious "I'll kill you right here" 😂😋😂😋
Zach is a player omfg. Honestly though I would date him on a heartbeat i love him. And I weirdly love his friendship with Eugene tbh
Eugene was the most honest one there
But the lie detector doesn't  work.
I need them to re-visit the lie detector monthly. This was great.
Ok but lie detector tests aren't accurate
ADD John?
When lie detectors are fake any ways
He's telling the truth.
Did I actually just see a gun rights ad on a buzzfeed video?
7:13 your welcome
Make john one of the try guys
"Everything is a toy if you play with it"
John scares me.
I was hoping Keith would say himself as his favorite
I'll have Keith's children.
John is a very interesting character I'd love to see a cartoon with a guy like him
god this guy is so mean ahaha
Search up John he isn't a real polygrapher lol
who else felt emotional or almost cry ......or..
Thank you for doing try guy videos that aren't squad wars :)
ZACH YOU PLAYER YOU
Polygraph tests are only correct about 50% of the time and are not admissible in court.
The polygraph is doesn't actually work. A lie that supposedly detects lies.
The 700 dislikes are nuns
"I'd kill her" bruh had me in tears 😂
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 

I love that guy!!!
"Eugene, Do you believe in true love?"

"No"

Clearly because you have never met me
You Can Bypass a Lie Detector
I LOVE THIS!!!!!!! CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!!!
keith:is your hair the product of all your insecurities?
eugene:yes 
john:he's telling the truth 
eugene:it was the one thing people said was attractive 
me:eugene needs a hug bring back the hugging bear
oh my god John is so intense
Do you think I would make a good husband? 

-Eugene in the background
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The lie detecter guy was so creepy and weird!
Zach: We should have a black member right?
Eugene: Of course 

😂😂😂😂😂
Ned soooo loves his wife ... 😻
That was fun to watch:)
Eugene x Zachary
I wonder if Eugene is one of the co-workers that Zach has made out with ;)))
I believe John is the Machine and not the Lie detector itself
😂 polygraphs are easy to beat.
John needs to become a permanent part of Try Guys!
When in the Bible did it ever say god hates liars god loves everyone
keef ez teleng the trufth
3 COWORKERS ZACH?!? 3 F ING COWORKERS?!? NOOOO :'( That should've been me :'(
I fully expected Keith to say his favorite try guy was himself
Lie detectors are wrong as hell. The guy who created them said it was like Frankenstein's monster. Watch the Adam ruins everything episode.
" God hate's liars and I hate liars." Dude I swear he sounds like a serial killer.
John is a savage!
the change in zach's face when he was asked if he thought he was the best...was kinda heartbreaking
god hates liars.
Zach you can marry me.
GUYS STOP MAKING EUGENE THINK ABOUT HIS INSECURITIES
John is my Spirit animal
Marriage doesn't go bad with time when you take your time finding the right person . Don't get married before knowing yourself !
L Y I N G   M A K E S   Y O U   G O   T O  H E L L
Who tf hurt John?
God hates liars, I hate liars 
Therefore, I am God
I loved what John said!!!!! I'll kill you right here!!!! It's not a toy!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can John be the newest Try Guy?
ohhhhhhhh god! this is cool
god hates liars and i hate liars hahahahahahahahahahahaha
from 7:45 to 8:37 was the best part
"God hates liars and I hate liars"
"Everything is a toy if you play with it"
"I don't know those babies." Good explanation.
That's my dad yo
its the guy from def digital
The guy reading it sounds so depressed!!
favorite try guys vid
Except a polygraph is a lie itself. A polygraph reads blood, heart rate, and sweat. The only thing you have to do to trick a polygraph is be completely calm. There are schools that teach people how to trick people.
EUGENE HAS A DOG. THATS IT! HE IS THE PERFECT GUY
Is this john from all def digital? 😂
"Do you believe that Buzzfeed is overrated and you're only a part of it so you can eat expensive food?"
"...No."
"He's lying..."
Pleaseee do another one!! We want more secrets😂😂😂
John needs to be a new try guy
This is not how a poligraf works...
it sounds like if he catches you lying he will kill you 
no offense
Zach: Eugene do you know how much the three of us care about you?

Eugene: No

Keith: Damnit we gotta be better at that

Aawwwwww
ADD
god doesn't exist so he can't hate lairs
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." -  Zach Kornfeld, 2017.
We all know that these tests are totally faulty and have led to hundreds of false convictions right? Okay? Alright, got it, I'll show myself out 😬
John is the real mvp
I was literally laughing the whole time 😂😂😂
Eugene broke my heart. We all love you Eugene and think you're the best Try Guy.
I cried when Eugene said he didn't know how much he meant to all of them
I'd kill her lmao
Omg john in the beginning I couldn't stop laughing 😂
minute 4:57, the beginning of my OTP
I LOVE JOHN "ILL KILL YOU RIGHT HERE" IM CRYING
I love John!!
eugin so hot and super cool ...✌
Polygraph Examiner said "God hates liars and I hate liars." Well, moron God is the biggest lie of them all and you fell for it moron. Organized religion was built on one big lie to control the masses.
I'm a pathological liar I literally will tell a lie and even tho it's a lie my brain will actually belive that my lie is the truth.
Something about Ned just severely annoyed me
This had me dying
how was eugenes hair the only thing that was attractive when he was young? i find that very hard to believe
John is my spirit animal
Why do they change clothes when they go to the lie thing
I love this so much 💚
Kieth is my favorite try guy too!! and Eugene is gorgeous!!
So this is what Ron Swanson did after Parks and Rec.
John is a savage 😂😂😂😂😂
is it just me or Ned & Eugene are looking super HOT!!!
Try guys train like superheros?? Plzzzz
"I've tested over 8000 people" .... lie detector explodes
"A lot of woman died of disease, so we had to use the town psychic".
Not a line you hear,ever!!!!
"Well, everything's a toy if you play with it"
New life motto
Someone save me look at Ned in that shirt
Lie detectors don't work
lol I understood "Do you like Ned Stark" when he asked "do you like ned's dog"
I'm scared of john
John seems like he wants to kill himself like if u agree
please repeat this with other peoples
John looks like he's been doomsday prepping for the zombie apocalypse for decades.
wasn't surprised Keith has wondered about fitting penises in his mouth
i don't believe in love too
THIS IS SUCH A GOOD VIDEO
Eugene: I like being hooked up to machines
Me:
Me: Oh
if only i used this on Light....
Keith is everyone's favourite !
Damn Eugene's questions XD
I just noticed that they had to change from their casual clothes to their interrogation clothes for each person 😂
John is my new favorite person of all time
That monitor guy needs mental support... get rid of him.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"
So due to the transitive property, I am God
The examiner reeeeeeeeally hates his life
bro, john tho.
I feel the same way as Eugene, 
as my parents have been divorced since I was three, and most other members of my family are divorced, I can't see how ANY couple could ever last a lifetime?
And this video was awesome!
0:30 oh boi
I was waiting for him to countinue like "God hates liars, and I hate liars. I am god.
Omg john 😂
yeeeaaah i'm gunna need a part 2 in the future please
this brought me joy
'So, that was great.. I like being hooked up to machines'
The polygraph test doesn't work, it just monitors whether you are nervous haha
I'd date Zach
Me: I'm always lying about something, only small things of course, but still. 

akward pause

Me: I feel kinda bad now that I think about it.

John: She's lying

Me: DAMNIT JOHN
I WILL MARRY ZACH (please?)
This video gave me anxiety
" I don't know those babies " 😂😂😂😂
"everything is a toy if you play with it" They sure like their toys
Keith should have just named himself when asked who is his favourite
Omg they all like Keith the most! :O
The sexual things are untrue
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" very true Zack😚😬
Way to find the creepiest polygraph tester
Eugene is looking all secretive and fuckboy-ish when sitting in the chair
this is boring
lol God doesn't hate anyone... i'll probably get hate for this but people should respect ALL religions.
I wish they asked Eugene is he was gay, and then he'd say yes and I'd be a happy man
I Ship Eugene And Keith😂
Lie detectors are a complete scam, in fact all they do is just simply messure your heart rate blood flow and how much your sweating
I LIKE this video very much!!!! do more of these
"It's not a toy....." You hooked the Try Guys up to it, that automatically makes it a toy.. :P They are man-babies! XD And that's what I love about the show.. :3
0:28 Creep Alert! ... lie detector tests shouldn't even be permissible in court, they're so unreliable... and John almost certainly lies- every single human lies.
I don't know why but I saw polygraphic as pornographic
John is not messing around.
too bad lie detectors dont work
Everything's a toy if you play with it
It's weird how John calls everyone "he" except for Keith.
I'm laughing so hard!!!!! He said "I don't know those babies" 🤣😂
Why does Eugene remind me of an Asian Josh Dun?
EUGENE WANTS KIDS <3
These are the kind of Try Guys episodes I've missed
John should have said,"God hates liars, and i hate liars. Therefore, i am God"
That old man just seems super unfun annoying and grumpy.
L y i n g m a k e s y o u g o t o h e l l
I loved this. ... how long til 200 video? xD
Pauze the video at 1:08 and look at Zach
ngakak so harrdddddd 😂😂😂
John sounds like a robot.....
Eugene is so Asian. Like in more that just appearances
I'm sorry but every time I look at the people in the back it always reminds me of the 'Dope' MV....
"Do you plan on having kids."
...
"Yes."
MAD FANGIRLS SCREAM
God hates liars, I hate liars
At 6:07 Eugene is like "gasp drama alert"
John is so mean XD
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"
zach looks so hot in this damn
that guy is like, the saddest man on earth
Hmmm I thought they already did this but again it look like they did something similar to this
I just feel like there ask bi
Zugene OFFICIAL!!!!
Eugene wants babies is the most shocking truth uncovered
Alcohol is a cheaper alternative
Imagine you lie but then he (the man) says " he's telling the truth " lol
Zach says he's going to be single forever yet he's made out with everyone in the office
I love them so much. Eugene though 😍😍
Eugene.... I don't want to say I feel sorry for him, but I do feel a ping of pain whenever he talks about himself and his personal life...
But God does not hate.
That lie detector interpreter was probably the most boring/dull person I've ever seen in my life hahaha
Lie detector tests don't actually read lies they tell nervousness and if someone was nervous the whole time truths would read as lies.
I never want this video to end!!!!!
I think Ned is hotter than Keith. Please don't hate me!
I'm very scared of John
'god hates liars, i hate liars.) John 2k17. soooooo does that mean that gods name is john and that he is a Polygraph Examiner?
It must be so awkward for the Lie person
tbh though...Keith is kinda the best.
'Nobody likes nuns. I grew up Catholic' Preach it Ned
dude said God hates liars and he hates liars well he just lied that God hates liars
John as the new try guy ... make it happen
I mean, he is the best of the try guys.  Love you all though :P
I think what they said about nuns is mean
God HATES liars! And I HATES liars!!!!
"I'm not a fan of lying, but I do have a lot of secrets." Me too buddy, me too.
DOES THAT MEAN THAT JOHN IS GOD??
john seems like a barrel of laughs
"I like being hooked up to machines" NO EUGENE THATS NOT SOMETHING YOU SAY ON THE INTERNET WHERE PEOPLE TAKE THINGS OUT OF CONTEXT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The monotonous voice John speaks in is just hilarious.
Why is the polygraph guy so f*cking intense?
i love this video so much
I love this episode!
Dab
#ZacGene
I like John
I'd date Zach in a heartbeat.
"God hates liars and i hate liars" ..is he God?
"gods hates liars, I hate liars" wow that just turned creepy so fast.
Mexican try guy right here 👍🏽🤓
Wait is Eugene bisexual? He was in all those videos about dating guys or whatever but no one has actually confirmed it. I'm queer and I want to know if my baby Eugene is too.
democracy manifest
This video was so hot and I have no idea why
"God hates liars, i hate liars." Me: "Woo calm it down there buddy"
Scandalous.
I thought he was gonna take them
I love how everybody is shocked that Eugene wants kids
can john be any weirder? yeesh
The try guys should take pole dancing classes
CAN JOHN JOIN THE TRY GUYS PLEASE
I like john
Ned's like breaking down at the end. That shit's hilarious. "I DON'T NEED YOUR EXPLANATIONS!"
god doesn't hate anyone
buzzfeed is cancer
I want to be hooked with one of these to see how honest I am
I hate to be one of those people but Eugene is so unbelievably handsome I just...omg
"I'd kill her."
Lie detectors are not detecting lies. It is more accurate to say they are truth verifiers. The machine can't tell you if you're lying but it will show you the comparison between your normal body readings when telling the truth to how your body reacts when you are lying. For this reason, someone who may not be lying but the topic makes them feel uncomfortable or makes them think of something that happened to another person, it may show as "lying". This is why the polygraph examiner will do follow up questions to verify if it is a lie or not.
"God hates liars, and i hate liars."
Whoa this guy is intense.
I love these guys
hey my grandma was a nun
"I dont know those babies." -stone cold killer ned
Lie Detector does't work it just test your heart rate
7:22 broke my heart :(
"Eugene, do you know how much the three of us care about you?
No
He's telling the truth
Damn, we got to be better about that"
johns ready to fight lmao
Eugene: For sexual sake sometimes? 
Keith: No?
John: Keith is lying. 
Keith: Damnit.
3:57

I'm dying inside
lie detectors are NOT real!
John is a God
I wish I could be hooked up to a polygraph.
Eugene is hot in a suit
i think john has some unresolved issues in his life…
Eugene is cracking up in the back
S-U-S-P-E-C-T
LIE DETECTOR PLUS TRUTH SERUM HAHAHA
Can John the polygraph guy be a try guy
I want to hug Eugene. I bet he smells great. :-)
Polygraph's don't work. You just need to be calm
8:19
TryGuys try Colorguard
lol all John says is 
He is lieing 
he is telling the truth
who is that nut job, "god hates liars and i hate liars", nobody on planet earth has never lied, god hates everyone apparantly
JOHN: "ill kill you right there" lmao!!!!!
These don't even tell if you're lying it just has to do with how nervous u are and heart beat
I loved this video!!!! Thank you for making it long!!!!!!!!
john is god he said his self
John should be a try guy
I just want to hug all of them
God hates liars, and I hate liars.
fck, john is scary
😂😂😂😂 oh my lord
John is a scary man lol
Ned: "I don't know those babies" LMAO😂😂
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." Wise words, Zach 😏😏
Ned: "I don't know those babies" LMAO😂😂
Adam ruins everything theme plays.
You guys should try some cyanide pills next time.
If you want to say no but you know it's a lie, say yes weirdly so it seems like your lying
Zack is the best try guy
Do you think I'm ever going to fine love?

Ya..

Keith is lieing 

Haha(fake sad laugh)hahahahha....           DAMMIT KEITH
Am I the only girl who might consider herself attractive and has a thing for Zach?..
"I've definitely stole some pens from Ned's desk." 
"DAMMIT"
john tested add
Adam already ruined this.
Do more!!!!
Love it.  Love you - please Part 2 ❤
(Fancy rhyme huh 😏)
That was one of the best try guys videos
Put subtitles on at 7:00
There is no lie detector
John is from ADD
John is my favourite person in this.
God doesn't hate liars, he doesn't hate anyone
recent videos have shown eugene is really insecure sometimes
everything is a toy if you play with it.
anyone else notice that he said Keith is lying for Keith but he's lying for everyone else
how to ruin a friendship ep LOL
I imagined zach making out with potential co workers
I've been waiting for this my whole life.
-Zach: Would you give up fried chicken in order to marry your fiancé? 
-Keith:Yeah
-Everyone: WHOOOOOOOOAAAA
Haven't we already proved lie dectectors don't work.
John the best try guy
i like Eugene the most
He's telling the truf.
Yo, John needs some chill.
Sometimes when they are lying,they look like they are being so sincere omg.
OMG they all looked so nervous XD
Ned ask about a serious question about his marriage the zach ask him About fried chicken😂🍗
It's John from All Def Digital! S/O to John, lol!
I wish I was a try guy
polygraphs are garbage. anything to raise someone's heart rate can read as they're lying.
plenty of guilty murders passed polygraph tests because they kept calm and kept their heart rate in check
Zach is so cute I wonder he avoids getting into relationships
What's with the outfit changes
3:50 I CAN CHANGE THAT EUGENE.. pick me, choose me, love me..
So if Zach's made out with 3 coworkers, and there's 3 other Try Guys...
They missed the opportunity to call themselves the "lie guys"
This may be my favorite try guy video of all time. I was laughing out loud! Keith is the glue that holds them together for sure!
everything is a toy if you play with it... 😂😂
I don't know those babies
I actually think this is my favorite video from the Try Guys series 😂
John scares me
lol. the guy that works the lie detector  is the same one for all Def Digital
How do they make this kind of video without getting pissed at each other? _'
THE 👏 TRY 👏 GUYS 👏 ARE 👏 FREAKING 👏 AWESOME 👏
"god hates liars and i hate liars"
It's not a lie detector, it's a polygraph. It measure blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity. It doesn't detect lies. Lies are more complicated than just true or false.
Hahaha these things don't actually detect lies and only monitor blood pressure and heart rate(some of the fancy ones monitor sweat), so if it's a hot day and are nervous under pressure then all you answers are basically going to be lies. You can lie on those thing all day if you keep your heart rate steady and stuff. That's why sociopaths and psychopaths can and have passed lie detectors, later to be proven guilty to a crime they committed and were asked about on a lie detector, and lied
An honest person may be nervous when answering truthfully and a dishonest person may be non-anxious. Hence the test is around 70% accurate.
that was fantastic! Easily the best try guys episode
"Do you like neds dog?"

"...No.."

"..what..?"
I'll kill you right here 😑😂😂
I love John so much oh my god
Zach is the best!!!!! He's hot too
John tho he was so funny
I like that John fella
I really love cooking! It's my passion and helps me to stay happy and positive. Please give me a chance to show you my special recipes. I know I am a small YouTuber but please give
me a chance. Many thanks CD x
the polygraph is flawed
It doesn't surprise me that they all like Keith the most.
I wonder if polygraph tests can detect compulsive liars. I used to have a bad compulsive lying problem and half the time the lie would be out of my mouth before I knew what I was saying.
Anyone else think they look smoking hot in white shirts and black tie?!
It would have been perfect if John said:

"I'd kill her...John is telling the truth"
whats 9 + 10
do you think Zach will ever find love ? yes.... Keith is lying. that broke my heart
Part 2 with the girls pls :(:(:(
Damn Eugene is the only child of divorce in the Try Guys and his views are different than the rest of the them bc of it. I relate to that so hard lmao. It really does change everything for you
Zack-"Do you think I'll ever find love"
Everyone-"Yes"
He's lying 
😂😂😂😂
John is by far the best try guy.
When Keith said he would give up fried chicken for his fiancé it warms my heart. I want a relationship like that.
"God hates liars and I hate liars".
they do know that a polygraph is bulls hit right?
ZACH SO SCANDALOUS
John is quite popular. he was also on ADD
John seems so pissed throughout the video.
dude my anxiety world be thru the roof😂😂😂😂
Eugene ❤️
" I'd kill her" I died
Except the fact that lie detecting tests have been proven to be wrong over 50 percent of the time....
polygraphs just measure different rates in the body, not lies and are used by the police and put innocent people in jail.
These guys are awesome if one of them ever left I'd be so sad
I love John!!! He's so funny and great!!!
I got eugene and zach mixed up because of thirteen reasons why.
Like lie detector tests are fake
Polygraphs are bs.i could tell when they were lying
ill kill you right here
"I'll kill you right now."
... (Ned asks him the question)
"I'd kill her."

We neef part 2 of this.. all the through part 100 please and thank you lol
John is intense
Everything is a toy if you play with it 😂
hahaha best video so far
Y'all know this is fake right, go watch that Adam conover video
God hates liars and i hate liars therefore i m god
"John would you kill your wife or save a boat full of orphans?"
"I'd kill her"
this thing has been proven to be a sham. even by the guy who invented it.
JON!
guys, i think we need to save johns wife... 
"i'd kill her" 
#savejohnswife
7:19 We all know that laugh is full of sorrow...
Polygraphs are not reliable
"I don't know these babies " 😕😂😂😂
John scares me, but he's hilarious
fyi these lie detector are no longer considered to be valid
Wow, John is savage!!
"... I'd kill her."
😂😂
Of course Keith is the best!!!!! I love hem so much and he is the funniest 😂
John has no hope in humanity.
John: God hates liars and I hate Liars  Long dramatic pause John you are kinda creepy.
"everything's a toy if you play with it"
Keith would give up fried🍗chicken for Becky AWWWW
you guys all do know that polygraph tests don't work, right?
"do you think you talk too much?"
"well when you put it THAT way..." Zach is me
Eugene you're right it does mess with your brains
I WANT JOHN IN THE TRY GUYS!
lie detector test are proven not to work
Lol. A black member. I was thinking the same thing Zach and Eugene.
Eugene: A boat full newborn Italian babies 
Me: XD
The polygraph test doesn't work. Lieing is more complicated than heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate.
yea after this Ned definitely seems like a psychopath.
John is bae
gosh I love them so much 😭😭😭❤
I WANTED MORE SEXUAL QUESTIONS
Does Eugene have a fanclub yet?
"I don't know those babies" 😂
yes the omnibenevolent God hates liars
ha try guys have a lie detector test maybe buzz feeds team should do this to reveal all the lies they've been feeding you
Girl version?
"Everything is a toy if you play with it'"







that, my friends, was the invention of sex toy..
John oml
Ohmygod the lie detector guy is the best "I'd kill her" SO DEADPAN 😂
Buzzfeed stole Jhon from ADD
'I dont know those babies'
since when does god HATE liers?
Keith beat the detector at least once. I know things.
Can we have a part 2?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!
This stuff can ruin friendships girl bye
The try guys try psychedelic drugs!
Why replace a try guy? Add a black guy.
6:32 when Zach pulled out the lollipop I was dying
lol wtf according to this they are gay makes no sense ahha
I'm a normal human being. I see Eugine, I click the video!😍😍😍
Is that John from those All Def Digital videos?
That's why Eugene's hair is so big, it's full of secrets.
"I don't know those babies." xD
TEA TIME!!
grabs mug and sugar
grabs popcorn
"Everything's a toy if you play with it " 😂😂
awwwww, Eugene doesn't know how much they care about him
Try guys?? More like liE Guys hAh
hahahah Zach made out with three of his co workers 😂😂😂 he is so cute for that and I love him so much 💗
the way keith says scenario
Everyone loves Keith 😂
zach is a precious cinnamon roll that needs to  e protected from the world
what do you guy think later the video what happened to them?
"I don't know those babies." -Ned Fulmer 2017
Soooooooooooo
Eugene's Gay...
THAT'S FRIGGIN AWESOME
While this is funny, polygraphs are not real science, and doing them with your friends is so a recipe for disaster
They should do a spin off channel like lady like
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE FIB FINDER SAYS
ladylike next!!!!
Try Guys try to lie.
When Keith said "then we already know" I just imagined Eugene dominating Zach. o-o
"I don't know those kids" rofl Ned
PART 2!!!!!
Zac is the cutest try guy and that's what matters
Y'all gay bruh.
polygraphs are inaccurate
Eugene's the best try guy
Lmao John is a savage xD
8:13 the way Zach put his hand on Eugene's shoulder😂😂😂
John was having SO much fun doing this
John is my hero.
there inaccurate
lmao they stole the polygraph guy from all def
I love that Eugene has that sexy smirk on his face the whole time
I would never do this with friends or family, oh god no. I can't have them knowing im Hannah Montana
"I like being hooked up to machines." Ooookay Eugene...
a world without ned and ariel in love is a world I don't want to live in
How does the asian have an insanely redneck name?
are we not going yo talk about Zach's laugh at 1:09
John scares me.
THAT WAS HILARIOUS
I'll kill you right here - John
I like Eugene and keith
In the beginning I thought he was going to say, "God hates liars and I hate God." 😂
Impressions before even watching the video 

Zach will be nervous answering 
Keith is the biggest liar
Eugene will admit something strange I'm thinking he's like a secret serial killer
Ned doesn't love his wife as much as we think
yoooo that guy is deeply unhappy in his marriage wtfff hed kill her?!
I dont believe in lie detectors at all but i still want a part 2 of this just cause its super entertaining
Why is john so serious like wtf
Anyone find it it funny a chingy has dogs
Sorry I'm new here but is Eugene gay? because he's so cute! 😭
Ned just kinda looks like Bradley Cooper, at the right angle.
They should make a new reality tv show called "Everyone loves Keith
OMG THE EXAMINER GUY IS SO FREAKING STRAIGHTFACED, SERIOUSLY LIGHTEN UP LOL
Well damn John "God hates lies, and I hate lies"
ha ha ha SO FUNNY ;)
It's the same guy that makes all the lie detector tests 😅
awwww when keith said we gotta be better about that, i nearly cried, it was so sweet. and he must love his fiance a lot to give up fried chicken
Lol
I miss the old Buzzfeed :/
god hates liars
ur going to be exposed anyway so just tell the truth
Eugene is the best try guy
Should have asked ned if he on his wife
Am I the only one that thinks John is trolling them? 😂😂😂
Am I the only one that thinks Eugenes the best try guy and keith is annoying and should be switched lol
God hates liars.. and I hate liars
I'm here for Eugene
John looks so unimpressed
this machine is not intirely precise
Poor John lmao
Lol
I'm Italian
Damn! This video was so fun and nerve wrecking!.. pretty sure if you've watched this guys since day one you'd feel the same! 😭😭😭
John's remarks are so funny omfg! 😂😂
this is funny as hell
I wanted to see the EKG
Johns Vocabulary:

He's lying.
He's telling the truth.
anyone thinks that Try guys and supernatural buzzfeed should collab😂😂
omg i felt so sad for eugene from the believe in true love thingy. like i know he isn't the type of a sensitive person so he just shrugged it off but i think everyone deserve to feel being cared. It. Is. So. Sad to not recognized it. A message for you, Eugene. you are damn precious. you are loved by thousands people. you are cared. hell, everybody always talk about you in buzzfeed videos. So, please see how your appereance means to us❤
got the poligrapher is like a machine
Jesus Christ John, chill
I mean the real MVP of this video goes to the one, the only, John the Lie Detector
I DON'T KNOW THE BABIES
do the try guys try airsoft
Ned: starts saying stuff about John being old and his marriage is worse than his

John: I will kill you right here
I don't think they're supposed to move during the exam
Hahahaha, lucky Zach ♥
YAY, John form All Def Digital.
"God hates liars so I hate liars"
Polygraphs are hugely inaccurate though
i'm shipping eugene and zack
John is so serious it's great 😂😂
KEITH'S "YEAH" WHEN HE SAID HE'D GIVE UP FRIED CHICKEN FOR HIS FIANCE WAS SO CUTE IT BROKE MY HEART
We all know that polygraphs don't work though, right?
No one's talking about John! He's so funny!
Zach looks like he's going to cry the whole time..
" Do you ever want children"
"Yes"
Well well well we have so much in common Eugene.... lmfao
John is kinda scary
That one question about Ned's marriage vs John's marriage AHHAHAHA
John: "I'll kill you right here"
30 seconds later...
John again: "I'd kill my wife"
Why is it so surprising that Eugene believes in ghosts? He's in Buzzfeed Unsolved for Pete's sake!
John 😭😭😭😭
Jon: "I'll kill you right here." 
Ned: "Flabbergasted sound." 
The other try guys: "laugh hysterically."
di
John is kinda scaring me
I thought Keith was gonna say himself as the best try guy
god hates lying i hate lying  deeeppp
Interesting they didn't ask who they thought was the worse try guy 🤔 That could've been rough
...John scares me and idk why
Hahaha Eugene: I like being hooked up to machines
well, everythings a toy if you play with it

listen to that voice of your mom-----f you play with it...youll go blind
That detector guy is scary
The try guys do gymnastics 
like if u want this to happen!!!
Polygraph tests are bogus. it all depends on pulse and heart rate increase. its super easy to pass those tests
john seems really depressed
Zach' Parks and Rec reference at the end 👌🏻
WHO DID ZACH KISS THO
Best try guys ever.
John scares me...XD
that polygraph guy was awesome
can you make a part 2?
You do realize that lie detectors are not a real thing, right?
tf
Best video ever
Lmao that guy has is a fatalistic fetishist
Funny video :D
These tests don't even work, if you stay chill, you won't get caught. Criminals have passed it many times.
8:20 John: "I'll kill you."
try guys, unsolved, and ladylike are the only reasons why I'm still watching buzzfeed tbh
Excuse me but this is the same guy from Al Def Digital 😂
0:28 "God hates liars, and I hate liars" so why are you saying you can tell if they are lying using a polygraph? Which is a device proven time and time again to be ineffective at detecting if someone is lying. Do you hate yourself? Even the guy who invented the device said that he regretted ever inventing it, because it doesn't really work and has been used by law enforcement to put many innocent people behind bars.
god doesn't hate lol
on my channel I just posted me falling off my couch if you want to cheak it out my YouTube is P.J.C Videos I wanna hit 5 subscribers in 24 hours if you guys can make that happen! thx
Bit gay
It's so easy to cheat on these but it was still veeery entertaining :D the guest dude was really funny :D
I'm new, is Eugene gay?
They should add a really nice looking black man to the try guys
"Lying makes you go to hell" - DanandPhilCrafts 2017
0:27 Does that mean you're a backwards dog? AWESOME!
this is fake
This is probably the worst way to tell if someone is lying.
omg john is very creepy ..........
the try guys try lies
I really want Eugene to loom over me and whisper with his sleeves rolled up to his elbows like that.
1:04 seriously he wanted to put a penis in his mouth XD
The ship for Zach and Eugene has sailed!!!!!!
that john or whatever he's called looks like the most boring friend ever
John seems like a hoot. 
It's like level 500 Ron Swanson.
who hurt John?
damb john
Zach is sooo cute!
Wow i loved this XD This was so funny and the detector guy was amazing XD
8:20 I'm done
wow too much things got exposed I can't even
this video was just gayyyy
God hates gays, I hate gays.
You guys were cooler when you faked your videos! Wait...oh it's buzzfeed. I got it now.
John is a savage "no"
John: Imma kill you
"Its the only thing people told me was attractive" BUT YA HOT THO
I wouldn't want to be left alone in a room with the lie detector guy...
when Ned said he'd rather kill the babies than his wife because he didn't know the babies.. I inhaled so hard (because I was about to laugh) that I almost choked on a olive 😂
this is the best video in a very long time😂
L Y I N G  M A K E S  Y O U  G O  T O  H E L L
Imagine having this guy as your father😄😄
OMG  this was so funny!
They should've asked who's the least favorite try guy so it's even more akward
Wait... Wasn't the lie detector test proven to be able to be cheated?
What happened to Zach's neck?
what we learned today:
keith is everyones favorite
ned will kill anyone for ariel
eugene's hair is a product of his insecurities
no one thinks that zach will find love
I feel stressed out for some reason and im not ever there 😂😂😂
When they asked Ned if he has a better marriage than John! OMG!
ADD is way better then buzzfeed
Who else thought Keith would say "Keith" when they asked who his favorite try guy was
"I love being hooked up to machines" oooh
The test is the heart rate,if you stay chill, you won't lie.
Lol I honestly thought Keith was gonna say he was his favorite Try Guy
I bet Ned hopes Ariel isn't watching this.
john u a savage boi
Ned: Everybody has problems
John:*slowly turns head* I'll kill you right now
Me: DYING OF LAUGHTER🤣😂🤣
John is my spirit animal
i wanna know which 3 coworkers Zach made-out with
John is scarily intense.
7:45 - 8:38  best part  lol
7:06
o,o
CMERE LES MAKE BEBES >:3
this just made me love Eugene more tbh
sooo funny
Too bad polygraphs don't work!
Hmm.... that must be another brother of Ron's. John Swanson.
I love the try guys! mabuhay! from the Philippines :D
love it
Eugene says he's not the best, but when i look at the comments there are 100 girls talking about how great he is... YOU KNOW NOTHING EUGENE LEE YANG!
I couldn't stop smiling
Finally a good vid in YouTube I've been looking for something interesting to watch.😀
"It's not a toy"
i watched a gay porn one, the chick never came, but this is the gayest thing iv ever seen like cum on lips gay
john just made this video even BETTER
we fnally found something imperfect  on eugene :( he doesn't believe in love
petty that polygraph's are often wrong
"I'd kill her"
"Eugene, do you know how much the three of us care about you?"
"No."
"He's telling the truth."
"We got to be better about that."

aww
"Nobody likes nuns, Eugene" hahahaha!
Nunsense!
(i have to stop)
man alive, they always try things that could mess up friendships haha I couldn't do it
Doesn't believe in love, but, believes in ghosts... makes sense
its a polygraf, not a lie detecter. it has many flaws
Lying makes you go to hell
I love the way the lie detector guy says, "He's telling the truth."
Zach and Eugene my poor insecure babies.
8:10 LMFAO ITS 4:00AM AND I CANT STOP LAUGHING HONESTLY FRON HERE IN THE VIDEO ONWARD I WAS CRYING OF LAUGHTER
FINALLY...




Finally!!!
Try Guys more like Lie Guys
These four ppl are the best thing that could ever happen to Buzzfeed....
John is God
I wanna hug Eugene :(
Omg John is the best 😂
i have to take a polygraph test next week for a job so the timing of this video is scary
Prove I have a chance of being seen
When Eugene said that he doesn't believe in true love I got really sad :c
Those polygraph tests do not work
I'm pretty sure they got this idea from Revelmode. it's basically the same thing, except without the pie.
the lie detector test is fake you just cause yourself pain, breathe at a steady rate and lie on every single question asked that increases your chances of passing 50%
John needs his own show
"I'll kill you right here."

And thats when I died of laughter
Eugene is like me. I don't believe in love.
Eugene. I want you.

also, this is the best try guys of all time.
"I'll kill you right here"
Congratulation, You are officially god. You  start on Monday.
Eugene: I liked to be hooked up to machines.
I honestly can say I don't have a favourite Try Guy, I might like one over another depending on the video content lol
"The try guys" Lol
What's next? The try grandpas?
How does Eugene do his hair?
Eugene is beautiful just saying
Keith's "I didn't even get that" actually got me
LMBO! "I don't know those babies.."
"I don't know those babies."
These things just monitor heart rate
Cant tell if the lie detector guy is serious or not.
so is Eugene top or bottom with Zach
I was almost on the floor crying I was laughing so hard. This was amazing X,D
he's telling the truth
he's lying
The best try guy in my opinion is eugene, I just can't help it wow I love him(not in a romantic way aha)
Everyone sub to me and I'll sub back
WHAT?! NED AND ARIEL ARE JUST FOR SHOW?! I'M SHOOK!!!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"

They're one and the same
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" Zack stares at the lie detector guy weirdly
Woah at 2:51 zach's voice sounds like a womans
Lie detector dude is INTENSE.
God eugene😭❤️
the polygraph is a lie
OMG. John... Is like... Really boring...
7:45 is the best part tbh
Lie detector guy: God hates lie and I hate lies
Me: Jesus Christ
So if god hates lies and he hates lies..... is he god?
When you have nothing to say
Can we get John (The polygraph examiner) to be the next try guy?
i dont know those babies
John: "I'll kill you right now" 


I SPIT MY WATER OUT OML
HELLO GUYS!!!
John: God hates liars and I hate liars... *camera man zooms in" because I AM GOD
I don't know those babies! HILARIOUS
1:37 turn on automatic subtitles
"I don't know those babies"
this is probably my favorite buzzfeed video ever
THATS NOT WHAT THE FIB FINDER SAYS!!!!
Did Keith just pronounce it SEE-NAR-EE-O? NO MY BEAUTIFUL KEEEEIIITTH IT'S OVEERR
EUGENE I CAN MAKE U BELIEVE IN TRUE LOVE
HOW dare him lol
the polygraph is a lie it doesn't work
I love John, he is lovely
An entire episode on Eugene plz
"I don't know those babies"😂
Polygraph test aren't accurate. The guy who invented it says so.
That John guy's super serious about a technology that's known to only be used for intimidation, but is still used to this day despite the inventor saying that it really was nothing more than a children's toy (ironically enough).
Love eugenes personality
who is gay?
I was hoping Keith would say he likes himself the best out of all the try guys
lie detector guy is the same from the add def digital videos...
"I'll kill you right now."
187 Views, 22K Likes....Seems Legit
Lie detectors actually don't test if you're lying or not, they measure your heart rate, perspiration, and nervous system arousal. Basically that means if your heartbeat speeds up just from hearing something like the word murder, the lie detector notices that. Ergo all you have to do to "pass" one of these and make it seem like you're not lying is to already be nervous before the detector begins detecting your emotions and that way it won't come across as anything suspicious if your heartbeat is already fast when it starts. That or some people don't even react to hearing things such as "Did you kill this woman?" This is why innocent people have been incarcerated just because they get nervous from hearing these accusations, or guilty people gone free because they don't react to the accusations.
the lie detector guy John got hecka red before he said, "I'll kill you"
Those are not accurate readings, the questions were complex, and the situation put a level of stress that skews the results
I now ship Zach and Eugene.
6:09 zach and Eugene in the back
He sounds/looks like john goodman in cloverfield lane
lie detector guy reminds me of Ron Swanson
Eugene X Zack???😂
Ned- "Marriages seem to get worse when you're older...."

complete silence

Dude- "I'll kill you right here"
Try guys do prank calls
6:33 someone asking the right question
Polygraphs are just pseudoscience they don't detect lies...SO WHO WAS AND WAS NOT THE FATHER?
they should do the bachelor with zach and all the over 18 viewers who would date him
My girlfriend ist sleeping next to me and im nearly dieing because i cant laugh out loud
But Eugene is the best try guy!!!
poor Ned!
JOHN IS THE BEST
Awww point zach
I went to a school run by nuns. Yes Ned is right nobody likes nuns lol
8:20
10:17
I doubt that device actually knows if a person is lying or not..
John should be an honorary try guy
5:55 SANAAARRRIOES?!?!?!
"He's telling the truth"
Are not gonna talk about how Eugene believes in ghosts and that his mother is psychic?
The fried chicken question 😂😂😂😂😂
Haha wtf John
do more please
Did anyone else notice zacks bold spot
Can try guys not get their own channel like lady like whom have 2 different channels for just them
Can I be a Try Guy? I'll be the black member
I don't know this babies
John is the embodiment of my true feelings
lmAo
tbh, I'd go out with Zack/ Zach idk how to spell his name
John looks like a character from star wars
"I don't know those babies" 😂😂
It's all fun an games until you realize that lie detector tests aren't accurate and this only portrays them to be, which an extensive mislead idea has spread to using polygraphs in the courthouse, potentially convicting innocent people.
I wish my self esteem was as high as Keith's lmao love him
poor john
"I don't know those babies"
The guy looks so bored
The Lie Detector Test is A Lie
everyone was so surprised when keith said he'd give up fried chicken for his fiancee.
Where has John been hiding all this time? "God hates liars and I hate liars." LMAO!
Thumbs up for John.
Ned toasted on this hahahaha
I love john
"Would you kill us for your own life?"
This was great
Anyone noticed that John only mentions Keith's name before answering "... telling the truth/lying?" 
Everyone loves Keith <3
Why I quit buzz feed
Tag yourself i'm jon
My favorite one yet
2K views and 30K likes? Seems legit
BRUHHHH SOMEONES EATING A FREAKING LOLIPOP

Eugene: I like being hooked up to machines

God does NOT hate Liars, he hates sin itself. God loves everyone, gay straight black white Asian. doesn't matter
8:20 "i'll kill you right here"
I felt neds humiliation
EUGENE NEEDS TO ADOPT MEH.
"god hates liars" alright
I believe in ghosts too bitches
"I'll kill you right here" OMFG.
I'll kill you right here XD Dying!!!
"God hates liers, and I hate liers"
Lie detector tests don't work.
John came from ADD to buzzfeed, traitor
Very interesting video 👍
i'm an italian baby so killing the italian babies made me mad 😡

College Humour > Buzzfeed
Coke > Pepsi

Watch History > Search Histor
 Kittens > Puppies 
Give It A Whirl Fuckers > Try Guys
ILL KILL YOU RIGHT HERE...
Who is ur favorite out of the try  guys?
5:53 "What are these scenarios?"
The way Keith says it sounds like Mario.
Next time they should do this test for Trump vs Hillary, instead of debates only.
When they asked Ned whether or not Zach would be a good husband, Eugene started laughing right away!!!!
Polygraphs are horribly inaccurate and are easy to fake
The Polygraph Examiner is a real life Ron Swanson.

Eugene's the best :-) I think either Ned or Zach should definetly be replaced.. no offense
Eugene is so bogus for that question to Keith. Still funny.
"do you know how much we care about you?"
"no"
"he's telling the truth"
"we need to be better about that"
their friendship is so cute and wholesome omfg
polygraphs  are FAKE news
this was so funny❤💙💚💛
"Eugene, do you know how much we care about you?"
"No."
;-; Eugeneeeee
I want John to be an honorary try guy
7:45  power to you guys ;)

Please more lie detector tests!!! :D
"I'll kill my wife."
Why does all the lie detector ppl look the same in multiple vids on youtube and they are always keeping a straight face
okay....that was the most halarious thing I've watched all week :'D
Buzzfeed could learn a lot from College Humor. Lie detectors aren't real. They don't work.
i LOVE neds hair in this video

I'm not trying to hate, but Keith is really self absorbed, and thinks he's the funniest and the best in the group
I love John!!
keith is the best try guy
Okay Ned looked HOT in this lighting
What we learned:
Ned REALLLY loves his wife
Keith is super overconfident
Eugene had a weird childhood
Zach is a player but will also be forever alone
That lie detector guy is a legend 😂😂😂
2K views yet the video has 29K likes!

Zach: "Eugene, do you know how much the three of us care about you?"
Eugene: "No."
John: "He's telling the truth."
Keith: "..We gotta be better about that."

So sweet ❤️😭
I love John so much xD
Disclaimer: I only watched until 1:49 so if this changes throughout the video please correct me.

From what I can tell this lie detector "test" is inherently going to fail. you need to set a base line (they may have done this off camera, but from what is shown on camera they did not) by asking simple questions with obvious answer i.e. "What is your name?", "What day is it today?", "Who is the President of the United States?". From there you can ask your actually questions and compare them to the baseline (again they may have set the baseline off camera, it's just that the on camera stuff makes it seem inaccurate).
"Do you believe in true love?"
"No"
"He's telling the truth"
"AW" 
HAHAH
I feel like Eugene's the one who wonders what he can fit in Keith's mouth
are the three coworkers that zach has made out with.. the other try guys?
Legende em português pls
Does anyone else noticed how John will only call out Keith's name before mentioning the result but not with the other 3 guys?
I'm low key crying about Eugene
i wanted to know if eugene had pictured any other try guy naked
In the most monotone voice possible
He's telling the truth
31,000 likes and 2,087 ppl XD

this was entertaining but the old guy is weird like he is so shy
My dads motto of the house when we were kids was "Liars go to Hell", and I think that's why I grew up be such a bad liar.
John is just a ray of sunshine xP
I found it kinda weird that all the really dicey questions went to Eugene. I mean, I wonder why though.
"i don't know those babies"

You guys could make an entire series out of this. Obviously not with yourselves but with groups of friends and strangers etc
How does this vid have 30K likes but only 2K views
Zach just licked the lollipop thru the whole video lmao
funniest try guys episode in a while :D
These aren't even accurate??
this video made me kind of sad because eugene just seems like he has repressed all of his feelings for a long long time
I'mma need to see some pictures of Eugene and Ned's dogs... do they have pictures of them on instagram?
The try guys need a channel like LadyLike does
I kill you right here and now 
I would kill her 
-John the grumpy pants -JK
this is the best
7:23 how do i love and support eugene unconditionally
so who did Zach kissed hahahaha
God hates liars, and I hate liars.
Is this the same John from the ADD channel?
" I like being  hooked up to machines " Okay Eugene. Hahah.
Video has 2k views, 30k likes & 4K comments...so people just like and comment without even watching? Lol Now that's dedication..."I don't even need to watch it, I already know what's up" lol
Part 2 ? 
This is super funny !!!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"  it's funny cause polygraphs don't work
those polygraph machines only go by how your pulse is
when someone so professional goes psycho.      it kills me😂
The man,
The myth,
The Jon.
God hates liars

NED YOU ARE THE BEST TRY GUY
What's good fam
"I don't know those babies" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

YESSSSSSS
Did y'all notice that John only said Keith's name? Like anytime he had the other members he'd say "he's lying" or "he's telling the truth." But for Keith he always said his name, "Keith is telling the truth" "Keith is lying." 😂😂 idk that's just something I noticed.
ned's devotion to his wife is amazing
John: "I'll kill you right here" 😅that man loves his wife!
THIS IS THE BEST TRY GUYS VIDEO
"Well,it is!"
petition to make john a try guy 

sign below
Keith's mouth is real weird like is it slanted or..?
Please do a part 2! This was super entertaining to watch!
I ship Zach and Eugene let's be real
But polygraphs don't actually work, they are a placebo, people say the truth because they think the detector will see if theyre wrong
Awww I love all of the try guys
Who else was smiling throughout the video?
Just saying...
God hates NO ONE🙄
John looks very serious about the lie detector.
It's John from ADD!
John is lovely...

John has no chill. 😂
Love him.
Technically, polygraphs don't detect lies, they detect signs of nervousness (i.e. Increased heart rate), which happen to coincide with lying. If you were nervous the whole time, there's a very good chance that even your truths would register as lies.
This was the try guys funniest video
Zach looked super nervous 😂
This made me love Eugene even more
Hahahahahahahahahah
try guys try going blind for a day. Go
I wish I could remain as composed as John.
"I don't know those babies."

Lie detectors don't work, they measure heart beats, blood pressure ETC, that doesn't mean you're lying you could just be sweaty or doing cross fit
polygraph tests are totally inaccurate because the person might not be lying they may just be nervous and naturally have a high blood pressure. also you can fake a polygraph test easily with breathing techniques and practise

youtube is broken send help.
Lie detector tests are yes and no questions that are asked and answered before monitoring them asked again once hooked up.  These off the cuff questions are not valid.  Also you are not allowed to move your head or fingers because it messes up the readings.  This whole video was for show and it a valid test.

This is fantastic
"I'm John. I'm a Polygraph Examiner. I've tested over 8,000 people. If I see one of them lying I will let you know. 
   God hates liars, and I hate liars."

Gee, polygraph examiner! For someone who is so against lying, why are you using such language?.. I believe you're trying to say God is real, and you follow this Gods will. Unfortunately what you really said is "God hates liars, and I hate liars(; I am God)".. You ended up looking like quite the narcissist.

By telling the truth in both statements you inadvertently implied you are God, because you are the one who determines who is lying... Answering with single words to the question format increases polygraph testing accuracy, so much that it is my assumption that it is required.

*I dislike buzzfeed. If asked, I'd say I don't care what buzzfeed thinks. By leaving comments on their videos; I show that I am petty. Though I'd pass a polygraph test saying "I do not care about buzzfeed" through linguistic manipulation I am not so disingenuous that I'd show disrespect to another human beings word, until proven incorrect. *
I love you John, so much
That guy was scary

Lie detector tests are bs pseudo science.
I love Keith oh my god
Lie detectors dont actually work. They just monitor your heart rate and people assume that when there heart rate or blood pressure goes up that they are lying.
I don't know those babies 😂😂😂
The lie detector guy was killing me when he told Ned he'll kill him
john is psychooo
Zach: You think you have a better marriage than John?

You know the "lie detector" test doesn't actually prove the person lying? All it proves is if someone has a strong reaction to a question asked, but that can also be from being nervous or other confounding factors. You need multiple sessions asking the same questions with the same response to have some confidence the person is lying about those answers; even then it doesn't prove anything. They used this back in the day just to scare criminals with all the high tech looking gadgets they put on you to tell the truth.

John - I'll kill you right here
john is creepy
it makes me sad to hear Eugene put himself down like that..........I think you are the most handsome guy at buzzfeed! Your hair is always on point, you are ridiculously sexy, and your smile could light up the darkest room :) even if your hair was flat or gone completely (like when you guys did the bald cap video) I think you are VERY attractive! You'll always be my favorite Try Guy <3
🙄
I feel like John has some deep personal issues he needs to work out...
This made me hard
I WANT BABY EUGENE'S

Sorry but lie detectors DO NOT EXIST
God hates liars and I hates liars
yssssssssssssssssssssssss
i wanna ask if u could find a less creepy lie detector guy but honestly he made the video better.. XD
what's cool to me is that the lie detector reads your stress levels, so if you're a naturally guilty person like Zach, you'll most likely fail it if you're lying. for someone level-headed like Eugene, it's easier for him to remain calm when he's lying, so he passes it more often.
So funny

YASSSS I LOVE THESE GUYS. THANK YOU FOR INSPIRRING MEEEEE :)))
I really panic and get nervous when questioned for something bad, whether I did or didn't do it and around authority, so I would probably come up as lying most of the time
Who Is next, the queen?
They should've ask about each other. 😂
Like "Do you hate __."
Or talk about buzzfeed.
I'm I the only one who got serial killer vibes when he said.."God hates liars...and I hate liars"...(cue creepy music and face close up)
When John is getting really angry inside...
"I'll kill you right here"
One of my favorite Try-Guys videos.
subscribe to me!! BTW just made a channel so i haven't done anything yet
"do you think I'm ever gonna find love?" "yeah..." "..... Keith is lying" i died😂😂😂😂😂😂

"Nobody likes nuns, I grew up Catholic." Same, Ned. Same.
I would ask Eugene "do you like explosions?"

When you sneak that Park's and Rec quote in at 10:16
John reminds me of Grumpy Cat haha

why does it say 177 views, when the dislikes are over 245?????????????
Jon is the boss
I mean, the polygraph is fake but this was funny!
I love Keith bless him
Lie detector guy: GOD HATES LIARS AND SO DO I  (What's he's trying to say: I'll kill u if u lie)
All of these guys are in the closet. Even.... ESPECIALLY the married one.
I'm afraid of lie detectors because I get really nervous under pressure and it'll look like I'm lying the whole time

"God hates liars. I hate liars" therefore he is God
A person who firmly believes in polygraphs also believes in Abrahamic God. Makes one wonder.
Audio mis sync
Eugene in a tie and shirt😍
afaik the polygraph machine doesn't really reveal anything about lying, there's usually a body language expert present who examines the subject and determines if they're telling the truth or not.
everyone was very shocked when keith gave up his fried chicken
Polygraphs don't work for detecting lies
The guy is creepy 0_o

Why is there 200 views and it has gone up 1 hour ago??
163 views yet 16,037 likes?! Huh.... Youtube is making a lot of sense today!
God hates liars? And you hate liars? You sir, are therefore a sinner, and so is God. God hates the sin, not the sinner. And if you choose to hate the sinner, you hate not only yourself by that logic, but also hate God, by that logic. Because you're a sinner and also projecting that sin on to God. So not only are you a sinner. But you're a sinner whom hates god. Because you're as sinner who hates those who sin by lying. And by hating the sinner, you are a sinner. And by God hating the sinner, god would be a sinner. And if you hate the sinner, you'd hate God. Oh, how I love exposing the hypocrisy of religious individuals.

This isn't accurate. You can't ask multiple questions in one session, and you can't ask questions when the person being questioned doesn't know the questions beforehand. You also can't ask open-ended questions, or have the person reply with anything other than a yes or no
Bitches gone be like "I need a man who will kill a group nuns and newborn Italian babies for me 😍❤️❤️😪"
the lie detector is easily messed with
Ned totally burned Zach with the marriage thing.Zach forever Single.Ned forever married.Screw Keith and eugene

157 views and 15,372 likes???
THX YOUTUBE
Post more JUST try guys videos, just the four of u
But sadly thou Polygraph can be easily manipulated to ones advantage thus make the test worthless. How do I know, well I watch YouTube late at night when sailing the seas of YouTube. So I'm pretty much an expert at this point.

well John's a bundle of joy, isn't he?
PART 2!!!!!!!!
Eugene though, doesn't believe in love and doesn't know how much the others care about him, feel like we need a Eugene appreciation day ^-^
Wait.... does this mean John is God?
WASNT THAT LIE DETECTER GUY FROM THE OTHER YT CHANNEL TOO? THE ONE WITH THE TEDDY DUDE
Tell me if I'm lying: There is only 156 views in this video.
I have anxiety problems so I know that even if I was 100% truthful I'd probably still fail the test. The environment alone would stress me out too much
John, the guy with the computer, was hilarious!  He played his character so perfectly.  Hahaha.
Omg I love them so much!!

You can pass that easily. just stay calm, lower your heart rate, and slow your breathing. it measures blood pressure, sweat, heart rate, and breathing. the more anxious or excited you are, the worse off you are

a lie detector is not accurate. A lie detector was once tested on a plant and the detector said it was lying. The lie detector is entirely based on sweat, blood pressure, and heartbeat. That could just mean you are very nervous.
118 views, 10,983 likes.... seems legit
Below 500 views squad
Lie detectors don't actually work though... they don't tell you if someone is lying, they only tell you if someone is nervous. Sometimes that correlates to pinpoint a lie, but it's not 100% accurate and if you know enough about it it's easy to beat
how is this vid having 118 views and over 10k likes?????????????????????????????????????????????

Eugene will more likely sink the boat full of Italian baby orphans than let someone pull out a strand of hair from his head.
John is literally the human version of grumpy cat
"Divorce does stuff to your brains" yeah it does. that ain't a lie.

Some of the answers you could tell just from their faces.
Aww Keith is willing to give up fried chicken?! woah
Lie Detectors aren't real. It's shiz.
The Polygraph test isn't reliable
Lots of criminals passed it just by staying calm
"I'll kill you right here" ....well that was forward John
the detector guy is like a statue, he literally just stares at the screen either saying he`s lying or he`s telling the truth



i wanna be like him :))

the polygraph is pseudoscience nonsense.
 it doesn't detect lies. it detects stress. 
you can be innocent and fail a test.
you can be guilty and pass a test.
it all depends on how levelheaded you are.
Why is it that when Eugene said that he's the only one in the try guys who has a divorce parents, it f**ked up my brain 😂😂 i dont even know why
Zack is adorable, I'd date him.

there is no such a thing like the best try guy! you all are the best in your category! Eugene is the sexiest, Zack is the cutiest, Keith is the funniest and Ned is... the wifeiest! ;)
You no nothing Jon Snow
I'd like to point out that polygraph tests have been debunked by scientists and even the guy who made it. Polygraphs have been passed by a number of criminals and there are even classes that teach you how to pass them; polygraphs measure your heartbeat and if you focus it is easy to pass it

EDIT: It also accidentally incriminates false suspects due to them being nervous about it, increasing their heart rate
6k likes, 52 dislikes, 1k views, and only 67 views. Nice

Haven't polygraphs been proven unreliable for years now..
Ned's achilles' heels was definitely Ariel

I can relate to eungene so much. His dancing is so me
EUGENE! OMG MAN HES SO WILD
Heels are fun. and also it's great fun for me to be taller than guys lol. don't worry Zach! some girls enjoy short guys. just gotta get use to taller ladies lol
Eugene liked sexyer then the others
Respect ladies 😏😏







impressed
"CAR! PLEASE! FUCKIN PEOPLE!",
zach was the only smart one because he got a block heel
trust Eugene to choose high heels called dagger pumps...
who was the chick that Eugene danced with
"But I make these high heels work"
Dose it make my but look good 😊
Keith's fiancé is so lucky
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SEEMS SO UNCOMFORTABLE !! EUGENE WYD ?! (Zach was so adorable tho omg)
zach is so cute i'm
Eugines dancing:
6:07
DANGIT EUGINE STOP BEING SO ATTRACTIVE
(but dont actually)
DID I JUST SEE DORMTAINMENT?
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORRKKK
Zach was the only smart one and I supported his decision from the beginning
I'm fourteen, I'm five foot two, and I'm an actor. That means I'm expected to wear heals in every production I've ever been in. For the last show I was in I was asked to wear six and a half inch heals. The way I was forced to practice was dancing. Hip hop dancing. For three hours straight, everyday. Then followed by singing and acting. Y'all are little bitches.
I can't wear high heels over three inches cause if I do I'm a hazard to everyone and everything
if you pause at5:47 there at a strip club look at the GUY on the pole in the corner....... OMG
THE TRY GUYS TRY POLE DANCING PLEASEEE!!!!!!!
I have a feeling Eugene would actually wear the short boot heels on a regular basis
SAAAAMEEE and I've been wearing high heels since I was 4 years old, more than ten years, but now I can wear 8-10 inch heels for like 8-10 hours walking around and surviving 
PS: Go Eugene, work it boy!
I LOVE NED AND ARIEL
Can anyone please tell me What "lgbt" means?
I think Zach would still be taller than me even if I wore heals.
omg Eugene! SLAY! love the shoes, love the dance moves and poor your feet
Welcome to the pain of women. I get blisters from my heels. I wear flats and tennis shoes as much as I can. Be happy men that u guys r not women.
"My fiance painted my nails.",well if that ain't goals...
6:23 i wanna be that girl..
Eugene killed it though
"welcome to the real world"

i would pounce like a mutha fucka 

lmao judge me idgaf
At 16 I had 13 pairs of dagger pumps 👠 


Is that bad
Those people who can run in heels. HOW???
who was the girl who was sitting in between Ariel and Becky
I loved Ned's outfit!
Six inch heels . . .She walked in the club like nobody's business. 
Damn. She murdered everybody and I was her witness.
but I make these high heels work
I could make it the whole time but I'm male
When you drink, it distracts you from the pain- A Tale of the Modern Woman
4 men can walk in heels like nothing 
me: falls wearing flip flops
Being drunk this video is so depressing. Come on Eugene just work it, stop complaining
I wish I was that girl Eugene danced with...don't judge me.
I just came here because Buzzfemifeed disabled the comments on the manspreading video. 😂 alright
So Eugene just looks good in every thing, that's just a fact. But out of the rest of the Try Guys, I think Zach looked the best.
"I'm a foward thinking man, I'm responsible.. so imma get drunk." -Zach
can u do move videos of this plzzzzzzzzz
I love high heels and wedges idk y
Eugene looks hotter than me in heels.
Eugene's legs doe
Interesting, Eugene can dance in heel but cant walk on one probably.
Eugene can dance with hills better then me
Zach had it easy. I survived a whole school day from 7:45am (and I walked to school, so actually it started at 7:20am) to 3:25pm with 10cm (about 4 inches) without platforms and in the end I barely felt any pain.
I would actually wear Zach's outfit. 😍😍
we must admit that ankle boots are easier to handle than the others
I am in love with eugene
today my friend took my phone and made me sprint in heels... lets just say now she might be missing a couple appendages
I like Zachs shoes the most I would wear those I hate high heels
I'm 11
In my 3 inch heels
I lasted 7 hours at school I'm 3 inch heels
Eugines shoes tho!
it looks very cute on men
"They'll motherf in kill you" Eugene on dagger heels 😂😂😂 these boys never cease to amaze me!
Before you make fun of someone, try walking a mile in their shoes. That way, you're a mile away and you have their shoes.
EUGENE....DAMN
wow why is eugene so delectable haha
Ya know guys.. I'm gay but damn Eugene.
They're gay for agreeing to this
How is Eugene still single
What song is playing around 06:15?
Eugene cannot ever look bad in anything
2:32 TOO HOT
I would wear zacks booties
Why the hell am i watching this over and over again 😬
lol ned and eugene were  asking for a death wish with stilettos lol u need some platform boys
For wacky tacky day at my school a guy wore 4 inch red stiletto heels lol! He could walk perfectly fine, twirl around, and he even did a jump in them 😂😂 it was amazing
"this is Lady Gaga" :))
Honestly Zach looks good in those
lame
These guys really make my day with their videos and their honesty. Thank you. :)
Keith: "dinner is sittin'. Sittin's great☺️" breathing so hard trying not to laugh.
Okay now that now how is girls feel in heels
Dagger high heels? Don't theraten me with a good time!
can we just talk about how Eugene survived til the last two with DANCING AND DANGER HEELS vs Zac who just had comfortable boots and didn't do as much
the try guys shold
Ned is hilarious
"i may have made a terrible mistake... but i look hot" 😂
Hate to break it to you Eugene but you were not sexy walking in those things. waddle waddle -- Props to all four of you tho. You're more hardcore than me. I'd maybe survive a night in Zack's choice but I'd hate myself for it. Besides, I'm 5'8". I'm happy in flats. Hell I'm happy in sneakers.
There is something satisfying about men suffering from heels. because they usually don't have to.
All of you slayed those heels 👠
To be fair tho, not all heels kill your feet. I have a pair of heels that I cant bring myself to throw away even tho the suede is fucked because they are literally so comfortable and my mum has an open toed beige pair that I always steal cause they're comfy (neither have the large heels, like zac was wearing) You just have to find a good pair & get used to the ones that hurt/get super wasted so you don't feel the pain.
I could wear heels when I was 6
Eugene was giving me life dancing like that yesssssss lol
Eugene at 2:32
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
poor Ned 😂😂
The way he says toenails lmfao
how can people wear that!?!? wtf?!?!
"That tush got the push" - Keith
HAHAHAHAH that killed me
every comment.............Eugene.
the best pearl is when you take off your heals and it feels like heaven has blessed you
on Canada day my sister wore heals and she almost got her ankles broken
6:23 wth
I never understood the purpose of heels. For my 18th birthday I was given 7 inch platform boots. I wore them on my birthday but they haven't been worn since then. That was about 8 years ago
Haha Ned "See ya!"  splat Man Down! Man Down!
when eugene started to start dancing in that bar i started died it was so darn funny
I actually like zach's heels
5:31 - "hold my earrings"
I love heels ONLY on fun nights out. It's fun to dance in them. You feel great. Afterwards, it feels like a hangover for your feet, but it's fun.
My daughter is ten and she has already started wearing black heels
I love Zach's ankle boots :-) they're so cute
They're amazing I could never do that XD High Heels are too much of a torture for me. Comfiness for the win
I really like zacks heels
Does anyone know where to get Zach's boots? (UK please)
Honestly Zach's heels went the best with his outfit
ok but keith's nails look hella cute
Eugene is FABULOUSE
6:15 - same song that the buzzfeed girls danced for in the "Women Train Like Professional Dancers For A Month" video in Boldly.
Not gonna lie. I wanna be that girl dancing with Eugene
Don't throw those heels in the bin
"my fiance painted my ta-nails" - keith 2017
I NEED MYSELF A BOYFRIEND LIKE ZACH HONESTLY
zach x eugene ♡
Eugene walks like a velociraptor.
I think Eugene was challenged by my dance teacher😐🤔
Zach lookin' fine.
I LOVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
I wore  heels for 2 nights threw wut they did was a piece of cake
Eugene UGH working it
Who is the middle girl? Eugenes gf?
Gaaaaaayyyyyyy!!
0:38 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Eugene is flippin amazin!!! XD
"What advice do you have for us?"

"Don't."
Ok, last bar is a stripper bar.... I didn't wanna see that!
This is the best video I've ever seen!
try guys vs a point class
So when I get to the dumpster I take off my high heels ohh so good 


                                                                       


                                                                                     DUDE YOU SOUND HIGH
I have got 4 inch high heels and I can run in them
I feel like Zach has the outfit I would actually wear. It looks really good!
Eugene looked hot!!!!!
Eugenes wearing Barbie heels!
I love the ankle boots
0:37 dont worry zach i cant compete with 4 inches either
I would totally have Zachs they're so cute
Well this was fun
Eugene makes those high heels work
I've wore heels for about three hours and they didn't hurt sorta cause I like heels but I guess the last pair of heels I wore were like 4 or 5 inches
Zach is rocking those ankle boots they match his outfit perfectly
Eugene is just unbelievable
I think Ned get handsome more and more
🔫🔫😈😈👌🏿👌🏿
I dropped my phone on myself @ 6:12 lofl
I think Zach looks the best
I wore 5 inch heels at so many events and I was wearing them for a full day. I couldn't walk for two days after each of those events, but it was worth it cause I looked fabulous. I'm 13 for god's sake
Eugene started off on a suicide mission. Zach was the smart one.
Fun Fact: Heels were originally designed for men not women.
Lol, I only last 0.5 bars, forget 2 or 3.
Now that they have tried each part separately. It is time to really try a day as a woman. Power suits, bras with weighted boobs, make up, hair, and heels for a day at the office followed by a night out.
"You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels"  SAMEEEEEE
where did Zach get his heals those were f ucking gorgeous
The way Eugene said "I motherfucking danced" in that voice made me like "bOi"
Where did Zach get those heels? I want them.
Zach was going to get hit by a Rolls Royce...
He could've made some money that night
SOMEONE GO GET TAEHYUNG TO SHOW THEM THE WAY
Those ankle boots looked the most comfortable to walk in a wear your toes aren't exposed and the heel is wide which makes it easier to stand because when you're partially drunk and or tired those little sticks tip you over and the heels on ankle boots help hold you up
Eugene.... hats off to you man. I can NOT wear heels for love nor money.... well... maybe for love BUT NOT THOSE
I am an a 11 year old girl and I can last in high heels for up to 3 or 4 hours.
Though I haven't really worn heels, I'd wear Zach's anytime.
how do you f*****g dance that good?! Damn!!
2017
still wanna have Eugene`s baby.
Zach was smart
Zach dropped it like its hot lmfao stooooooop it
I'm convinced that Eugene is genuinely gay.
Eugine is so extra😂
Zach's boots were so cute they looked really "normal" with his outfit. I just love Zach
am i the only one who doesn't even have a problem with stilettos, even walking, and im 13???
I wore 2cm heels and got 5 blisters. Imagine what would happen if I wore proper heels.
They all look gay LOL
Idea: the try guys try hiplet (ballet crossed with hip hop)
Anyone else think about the song Don't threaten me with a good time by Panic! At The Disco while watching
Eugene is my sprint animal
did anyone else notice that Keith wasn't wearing a blue checkered shirt this video!?!?
Petition for the Try Guys to start wearing heels.
This is the best video 😂
how is it possible for eugene to get even hotter?!?!
They were at the stripper club
1:43 - 1:49
Now i ship them so hard
the only thing I have say about the suletos is the people that chose them are idiots
I can't wait till Keith will start saying my wife
I'm so in love with Eugene 😜
i love how everything eugene does is to impress his family
This vid is less about wearing heels than it is about going to bars. >_>
Ned really looked good in his heels, it made his tush+legs look incredible!
try guys try periods, boob weights and heels at the same time for a day
Lost a bet to guy in a chiffon skirt…
I just, they look so much better on guys
Why does guys wearing high heels look so normal???
Eugene look so classy/casual/stylish in this outfit😍😍😍😍😍😍
perks of being a toe walker: heels don't bother me no matter how long I wear them
high heels where originally made four men they where a sigh of manlyness
I made a terrible mistake............but i look hot
Fuckin Work it Eugene!
Zach looks so cute hahahah
Damn zach looks good with those boot heels
YES EUGENE YES QUEEN😍👏🏼😭😂
Try guys should try cheerleading
I want Eugene's shirt
Eugene hates Christmas yet he's so hot so it doesn't matter. Plus that curtain swish though. 

"I hate Christmas but u love unwrapping stilettos " - Eugene
Eugene looks hot
Keith is frickin' 6'6 in those heels jesus
ASK BRENDON URIE FOR A HOW TO PERFECTLY WORK HIGH HEELS👏👏👏
I Fuckin LOVE heals!
I frrreeekkkkinnf love eugine
"I may have made a terrible mistake... But I look hot"

Imao Eugene 😂😂
EUGENE THO
Honestly I think boots with heels look great on guys, typical pumps no but just normal boots yeah (boots with heels was originally made for men to appear taller in history, so I've heard lol)
I think society should be more accepting with this border between what man and woman should or should not wear, it looked great on Zach and he aced it~
The boots were wayyy better than the rest 😂I can wear boots, I can't wear anything else
Zach looks the best! he looks the most comfortable aswell
5:45 Eugene😂😂😂i CAN'T 😂
"I didn't take it off cause I thought I could last through the night, and my mom and sisters would be proud".......... don't worry Eugene.....we're still proud of you and those six inches sexy as heels(｡◕‿‿◕｡)
try guys are the best!!!😍😍 i love them!!! 💕💕
Woman choose to wear them. Your point is?
protect ned at all costs
That's why I wear shoe's that are comfy and don't hurt me.
Why is this so satisfying to watch 😩😂
"sitting is great." yep the best idea for a man in heels :)
I was inspired by Eugene.   " I motherfucking danced".       Now I'm in L.A.   Don't know how I got here
look at Eugene's t-shirt!! awwwwww
advice???? don't 😂
Is it sad that they can walk better than heals than I'll ever be able to 😂
Once I accidentally stepped on my dagger heels and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches, Oh my gosh the irony😂
I LOVE EUGENE
EUGENE IM LAUGHING SM
Eugene is my goddamn inspiration.
They made those high heels work
I honestly never have clicked on a video so fast
eugene lasted the longest yet his shoes were probably the worst and zach's were the easiest
this is why i never wear heels.
Cool fact- Heels were made for men to make them seem important.Women started to use heels after it was invented for men.
most men hate heels because it makes women too tall and they dont find them attractive. They aren't comfortable and if no one likes them why wear them?
Wow I love zachs heels.... I personally think they work well with his outfit
When are Keith and Becky gonna be a thing
I need the shirt that Eugene's wearing
Put them in chiffon skirts cuz' they make those high heels work
I Love this so much😻 and Eugenes dancing tho ... Marvellous.
i found it so cute that eugene had painted toenails tbh
Somehow Eugene got a girl...whilst wearing 6inch stilettos... how?
ngl zach's heels were really cute
Legendary
i wonder what people said about this
-He said Welcome to the real world

OOOooooøoooohhhhhhh
Ned and his butts...
EUGENE STOP BEING GOD DAMN HOT MAN.
Like a wear Eugene's heels and I can even run using them.
Btw they all looked hot.
but I look hot lololol 😂😂
"when you drink,  distract you from the pain " that explains many of my nights 😅
I would wear zach's outfit
WTFFFF how come they didn't tripped all over their feet
Eugenes looked really good XD
"Sitting is great"- Keith
Eugene is so tall
Zach's outfit actually looked good and comfortable damn need to tell me where u bought them clothes
omg, u guys should totally try going trick or treating with heels!!!! That's what I do every year,and im pretty young(12) so I do need to run and I also try to get to the most houses possible and lets just say its not horrid but not amazing either.like and reply if u agree!!!
Wait am I the only person that likes wearing heels? 😂
I need Eugene's shirt
These are so dope
I don't know why the girls act like walking in high heels is so difficult.
all I could think was LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK



okay but zach actually looked amazing if he wants to feel taller and still be comfortable he should get elevated insoles for his shoes protip right there
I really love this episode. I wear heels 6 days a week, normally 8 hours at work and then dinner and drinks after most nights. Its great to see other people understand what kind of pains they are, and what people do to look good in today's world. Sure they hurt, but nothing feels more powerful than when I step into my 6" red stilettos and hear my heels click against the floor at work.
The boots are too comfortable for this challenge. It's so unfair to other guys
I had to pretend to be a frozen Queen of Hearts for four hours in heels I can't.....
How are you able to wear those?! I don't think I would last one hour-ish .
Dude Zach had the easiest shoes what the heck those aren't real heels
Every girl in my whole family has had some sort of 
Incident with heels. My cousin shara on the other hand broke her knee cap in half well walking into a formal dance wearing flats.  Now thats talent.
Eugene is officially the Buzzfeed's Daredevil
Eugene popping dat booty like a pro.
Eugene: you are my spirit animal if you see this and you are man enough I want a dagger dance off
Dem heels 💃🏻👠👡👢
I think the heels Zach is wearing should be made available for all men...
Is eugene gay?
Who else wants to party with Eugene? XD
If I'd have to wear those dagger pumps for a night I would come home with a broken ankle.
I was laughing so hard from 6:12-6:30 I choked lmao
it's absurd how hot Eugene looked in those heels in that outfit
i love eugene's heels
Is anyone else on a Eugene playlist
Ned actually has very nice legs lol
Zach's shoes are my favorite. I would wear them. They seem the most practical.
Eugene's dancing has got me shook beyond reason
Who's dat man walkin' down da street, w/ dem delicate feet, it's Zac!
well, they make these high heels work 😉
How come the try guys can walk in heels better than me???
I cant even walk in flats without falling over let alone fuckin heels lmfao
Eugene is zaddy lowkey! Lol
Am I the only one who cringe over this? or is it me?
"What advice do you have for us"
...
"Don't"
Did Eugene lose a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt? CAUSE HE MAKES THOSE HIGH HEELS WORK!
eugene is hot
mkay.
zach you wear those heels EVERYDAY from now on cuz u nailed them
this is them with heels but this is me with sneakers so um yeah
heels
When Eugene where's heels better than you...
They literally felt everything that I feel on a regular basis; I wear stilettos and pumps everyday and this is precisely how it feels, now people can finally empathize with me.
Zach has the only pair of shoes I would consider wearing.
am I the only one that would prefer heels over flats and finds them comfortable?
oiii the ankle boots are cheating. Those are pretty comfy, not like stilletos.
Ned's wife is so annoying/bothersome/in everyway it can be said xP
P.s.Sorry for my english,i'm an italian girl ^^'
When your mum asks you to help her with the shopping but you can't find any shoes around.
I literally died when I think Ned spoke about pool. 'It's about bending over and sticking out that toosh' I'm deceased
I needed to wear heels for four years in my university, yup...
I love Zach's boots
I'm so glad I realised I was trans before I got old enough to go to bars, or I would have probably been peer pressured to wear Eugene's kinda shoes
Dude I love the look of heels but I CANNOT stand wearing them. I'm in agony within 10 minutes. Do I still buy them? Yes.
I wear some type of heel everyday, but even I don't think I could last very long in a 6 inch heel. My rule of thumb is the longer you're in them, the shorter the heel. For all day I stay between a 2.5 and 4. Also, the further the distance between the heel and the sole of the shoe the more comfortable they will be. Usually the taller the heel the closer that gap is and that's why they hurt.
This was great. To be honest, sometimes I wear high heels BECAUSE I don't want to stay out too late. Then I'm like, bye. LOL
Zack or Zach probably would be comfortable.
SLAY MY LIFE EUGENE
"almost got hit by a car".... was that a rolls roice... HA I woulda let myself get him lmao
I am loving this so much!!!!
Every situation explored 😂😂😂😂
How short is Zach?
The fact that Eugene's heels were the tallest (6 inches) and he done better than most of them, proves something.......
Haha being a girl with heels is hard. So dont challenge them to race u unless u r using heels too
Buzzfeed couldn't pay me ENOUGH these guy's must be desperate for something, Money, Fame IDK, you have men saying there actually pretty cute. Buzzfeed own's you but this was really funny so you have my respect
These guys are heroes.  Like the soldiers who invaded Normandy.
These guys didn't do heel training! I walk around for hours in heels before wearing them out anywhere to make sure I can walk in them
The weirdest part? Removing them after like 8 hours and feeling like your heels are sinking into the floor.
Why is Eugene a better woman then me
Lmao! This was so entertaining! Poor guys....This is the reason I don't wear heels, maybe a slight wedge but that's it!
Get a pair of Jeffrey Campbell or Dr. Marten heels!! I can wear those all day and feel great ;)
Cucks
Eugene was DRUNK
As someone who can run and jump in 4 inch heels this is hilarious
YAYAAAA   NEWW VIDDD I LOVE YOU GUYSS
If you find a comfy pair of 6 inch heels you're set 😄
Those boots actually look good
I dont think eugene like girls...unfortunately  he is a hot asian
DAT guy with the white pants looks hilarious
Make a: :Tomboys wear heels for a day"
I mean ... I can go to Disneyland for a day with those boots on ! I doesn't count !! 
But I would never wear a six inch dagger heels in my life , it's just ridiculous...
can i be honest right here? ZACH'S SHOES ARE SO CUTE. i love zach's shoes so much 😂 i cant wear high heels because im still to young but i live how they look. i get it they are hard to wear but damn they look so cute. i remember when i was 8 i wore these high heels that where ping and where strapped on. i tripped but still walked on 😂 being the 8 year old me. i lived them 😂😂
Honestly one of my favorite parts of being a tall girl (5'9") is not having to wear heels.
I always laugh when ned talk about his butt look good 😂
The worst thing you done was take them off and put them back on. It's like drowning, coming up for two seconds, trying to gasp for air but then you gulp water and drown again
My daughter is only 12 and she wears her older sisters 12 inch stiletto high heels!
I dont understand how she does that!?
Zach's shoes are nothing
Eugenes are the worst
I'm gonna day this rn


DAMN EUGENE U A STUD THAT GURL WENT FULL HARD DANCE MODE WITH U
Gurls who would u be in this vid:
Zach
Eugene 
Keith 
or 
Ned
I'm a Zach how about u guys
ok, feminise men...let the agenda continue.
I like their confidence and personality but I don't think they pull off the heels well.
TBH, if someone showed me a pic of Ned waist down in those pants and heels I would not think it's a dude
I didn't know Keith was engaged! :O
Eugene's a sassy mofo. I cant dance but he CAN!
Please try mani/pedis with fake nails lol 😂
I think the ladies are done!
I love Ned lol
lets face it only two men had real heels the other guy just had princes old boots
They should try pointe shoes and start doing ballet. It's frickin hell
I love that they were lowkey at a bar with half naked men
Try red bottoms ...
Um I don't understand why heels hurt other people no matter how high all my heels feel fine 6 in fine boots fine thin fine
Zach looked adorable and precious in his ankle boots oh my god
it would have been cool to see them reference buzzfeed's own high heel hack article.
wtf what idoits
everything who make women more useles are hot? shoes, nails, dress, rings.
Zack's heels look so good on him!
Eugene slayed it. He picked the most brutal heels ever.
worst job someone could have is to do videos for huzzfeed, even aftican kids who work 12 hours a day for no money have more dignity than this company
Oh my god LOL. 
Eugene got friggin lit.
The joys of being tall and not needing heels to still be taller than every other girl at a party :)
The Try Guys are still alive!! Yes! (Boo Squad Wars)

"I'm so much taller than normal!" Quote of the year!
next time girls try rubber shoes lmao
there was this one time I went out in 6 inch heels and everyone else took off their heels towards the end of the night but I decided I wasn't going to be that girl and didn't.... I legit could not walk the next day worst pain of my life¡
I cannot even stand in those 6 inches heels , Eugene fuckin slayed it
i hate eugene
Eugene was next level
Eugene slays
Came here to read comments on Eugene's butt!
So why are they wearing high heels?
I'm absolutely screaming eugenes dancing is outrageous
I hate when I wear heels for too long and my feet hurt more when I take them off😢😢 I have really deep arches so going back to flat hurts sooooooo much
humping and grinding isn't dancing.
Why does Ned's Put Lady Stuff He Always Says Does Is Make My Butt Look Good (I freaking like)
so anyone notice the rolls royce?
let's be real, zach looked bomb
That Eugene butt tho!
Zack almost got hit by a ROLLS ROYCE
Women choose to do this to themselves, the free market only gives them what they buy, this is not patriachy or oppressive to all you idiotic feminists, but just reality, also, there feet are different
Oh god Eugene.
High heels for men should become a thing
Zach made the most comfortable choice.
A child in Africa could've eaten those heels... I'll see myself out
I  mean Zack has the easiest
Eugene is like a striper in that one clip 😔😂
heels are hell
Zach was smart and wore a chunky heel.
Does Ariel work for Buzzfeed now? I love her.
Reasons why men should wear heels if they want
1. They make you taller and if you're insecure about your height, why not do something about it?
2. Unintentional leg workout
3. CALFS.
4. Ugh idk u do u
DAMN EUGENE
thoseee..🍑.....😛😍
Eugene got me feeling some type of way
As always Zach pussying out being the only one not wearing stilettos
why am i so attracted to eugene in heels
EUGENE IS SERVING LOOKS
I love Eugene so much this man is pure joy
now everyone knows not to judge drunk women at the end of the night carrying their heels and walking bare feet! they arent trashy you just dont understand XD
there are more than 2 genders
They should try ballet for 16yrs.
YAAASSS Engine Saly boy slay
I GOT A BTS AD AHHHHH
Eugene is the best tryguy like honestly
What's sad is that they rock those heels better than I could ever
I'm actually living for Zachs outfit
When my friends and I go dancing, we make a bet. Who ever takes their shoes off last, gets a foot rub from everyone else
flat out feels SOOOOO good omg
they lost bets to a guy in a chiffon skirt...BUT THEY MAKE THOSE HIGH HEELS WORK
I'm sorry but Zach's heels are not even baby heels 😂
Gosh that woman who got to dance with Eugene!
"Normally, I'm carrying my friends home who take off their heels. Tonight, Zach carried me home." TRULY FRIENDSHIP GOALS 🙏🏼
:/ i am a girl and cant do dat
Wurk it Girl Oo lala
eugene can pull off anything
guys if this comment gets 1000 likes i will personally go to buzzfeed headquarters and start a massacre for gender equality
Eugenes' dancing is MOTHERTRUCKING GOALS...
You should see Kim Taehyung! He can wear heels and even dance in them without falling😂🙌🏻
Nice video BTW
WHY do they look good in everything especially eugene
I love zack
I think Eugene actually lasted the longest because of how uncomfortable Dagger Pumps are.Zach lasted just as long as Eugene but ankle boots are actually very comfortable and the most comfortable out of the group
what the hell is wrong with buzzfeed
get legs.
I bet they lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt but they make these high heels work
I just LOVE!!!
1-eugene's sass 
2-keith's humor 
3-ned's " does this made my butt look good"
4-zach 's reactions and pureness
tmw Eugene looks better than you in a pair of six inch heels😐
The inspiration to this video was that they lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but they made their high heels 
W O R K
Freakin' Eugene though... 6:12 to 6:30... How does he manage to be so awesome in every video?
I'm a woman and I won't wear heels for thirty seconds, much less a whole night. And Eugene, Sweetie, you don't need Satan's footwear to look hot.
I think they are running out of ideas
if I see any comments saying "SEE THIS IS WHAT WONEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH ..." I swear imma rip those
 flats off ur damn foot and slap u with it
Eugene's inner drag queen came with when he put on those dagger pumps.
it's never a try guys video until the comments talk about how hot Eugene is and until Ned talks about his butt or his wife
Watching this made my feet hurt
The funniest video I've ever watched hands down!
The Try Guys are squad goals!
Wow, Eugene can move in six inch heels better than any woman
Eugene got a new gf LOL
Pause at 7:47, you're welcome.
Imagine these guys wasted and on heals
Oh that's guys masculinity is so fragile if he is intimidated by a woman taller than him. I think he is called Zach...the rest of them are fine!
Sooo... Some grown men went around town in heals with polished toes...

I LOVE THE INTERNET!!!
10/10 would wear Zachs and Eugene's choices on a night out... bc I have, and still do 😂 #sufferforfashion
This was entertaining! 
The boots are the only one I would last in a whole night. The dagger heels - half an hour probably. Walking  = hurts like hell, but when you dance and move your feet you don't really feel it as much. Alcohol makes it better...
Of course Eugene where's dagger pumps 😂😂
Well at least Eugene went for it yaknow
I like the bootish shoes
I mean, we have to go through a lot of pain and/or discomfort, but we have way more moments of sheer bliss than men do like taking off our bras or heels. Men only really have that moment of bliss when you can finally pee after almost busting.
oh my gosh, eugene's dance slayed my soul. STAHP
Zach's boots are so cute! I would wear those
WHOSE THAT MAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH THE DELICATE FEET
...were they at a strip club at the end ????
okay, but zach's heals absolutely match his outfit and I love it
"because the stiletto is so tall, they'll motherfucking kill you"
since when ned is so hot?
wusses
not my proudest fap
sooo gayyy
Their total ineptitude at walking in heels is what really got me.
Zach's outfit was lit tho lmao
Watching a bunch of dudes who we all know are up for anything just go on and on about how horrid heels are..(wel, besides the height addition and butt improvement lol)....makes me glad that I do not own one pair lol.
8:01 He nearly got hit by a Rolls Royce. I would've taken the hit 😭🙌
:))) you guys look so funny!!
they lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt
THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS
A BUZZFEED COMMENT SECTION!?
2:32-2:35 OMG SLAY
6:11 dies
Omg @2:30
If Zach likes being a lil taller why doesn't he wear man heels?
Zach looks so good in those forreal....petition for him to wear ankle boots heels regularly...
I can friggin' sprint and do my soccer practice and karate practice in them :I So, basically, I think this is disappointing...
Eugene and Keith were my favorites in this video. Eugene was slaying in those heels. And when he hit the dance floor it was over. Boy was serving looks and moves 😂😂
Eugene is my queen I love him XD He just slays me so much!
damn. Eugene's dancing.
The ankle boots guy made if work😂
6:15-> My boyfriend does this on a daily bases.
"I may have made a terrible mistake...but I look hot."
Same, Eugene, same.
If you got heels that tush has got the push
Zach is the only one with half a brain, but took his heels off the same time as Eugene wearing the dagger heels which means he's weak because those boots look hella comfy. Eugene was crazy for going with the dagger heels, but his stubborness made it work, Ned and Keith went ooh pretty when they really should have gone for practicality. There are two types of women who wear heels- women who can wear stilettos and women who wear ankle boots. Also, its not just a question of walking in them, because you can just horse step on the ball of your foot and have no problem, you also have to make it LOOK GOOD.
damn eugene
that song zach sang was the highlight of my life
Am I the only one who thinks heels aren't that bad? Like they barely hurt my feet...sure they aren't practical for walking for extended hours at a time and it's a relief to take them off at the end of the day...but walking in heels isn't that hard to do haha...but then again I took pointe for two years when I was a preteen so heels is nothing compared to that trauma lol
Flc num x um 😇 dhzudbxjxjxxjxbh,hgbxbcbcbcccksjqlzozm,.. . BB zuzxhfvvzjzbxcnffbkdjxixjzidjxizjxissiuffj
Is it weird that I'm the exact same as Ned???😂😂♥️
at the beginning  I was praying for these  poor souls
Tbh Im Eugene when i wear heels
Of course Eugene wore the highest heels
in all honesty i kinda wish men actually wore heels. they just look good on everyone.
Zach and eugen looked so good omg
Ok so they screwed up by going out in new heels. Gotta break those in man. It helps.
I want Zac's shoes!
one of the many reasons, I wear trainers/sneakers to parties rather than heels.
If Zach didn't wear those ankle boots, Eugene would have won by far, he also was so right, he looks so hot in heels
Can the Try Guys try teaching?  That would just give me life.
This is more beta then then the greek letter that comes before gamma.
The Try Guys are amazing for this one!!!
"I motherfuckin danced"lmfao
can i have Zack's shoes please?
Eugene. dear god, you are the only reason I watch buzzfeed anymore.
Almost all women's dress shoes are uncomfortable heels or no heels.
of course Eugene had to be sooooo extra XDXD
Buzzfeed should make a channel called Buzzfees try that would have Ladylike and Tryguys
yeh ok i see your point but zack looks gorgeous in those heels
I wear heels everyday and I love it. I run and jump in my heels. WIMPS!😂😂
zachs are boots...that seems like cheating
I literally have the pair Eugene has. No joke.
"Being a girl is easy" 

how bout that
Eugene is so incredible
I'm laughing because you guys are struggling yet I wear my Heels/Wedges every single day and my feet never hurt. Come on men you got to step it up most these Heels are a walk in the park for me and they don't hurt that bad. Best shoes ever made thanks Men!👠😂😂😂
EUGENE JUSST KILLED ME JFC
eugene had it worse. his heels were very high and harder to walk on. even girls cant do them
I.......I love these men
ankle boots are easy mode
I've taken an uber 5 blocks before because #heels no shame
They just threw out those pretty pretty heels 😭
Eugene , why so hot ?lol He looks better in stilletos than me lol
Those shoes that Zach has on really goes with his outfit.
Zach could totally rock those boots all the time. Nobody would really bat an eye.
when eugene could asian squat while drinking and wearing stilettos..
is Eugene gay?
Eugene is my inner fashionista 🙏🏽🙏🏽
dayuuuuuuummmm Oujean you are rlly geting down!
If I ever wore heels I probably just trip and land on my face
I AM LAUGHING SO HARD AT EUGENES DANCE BATTLE THAT I AM DROOLING
I have the same heels as keith
i died when kieth said "to-nails" 1:10 😂😂😂😂😂
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CIFFON SKIRT BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK (if you get this I love you)
I want Zach's shoes!
zack looked the best
This is why I don't wear heels.
"Keith? Would you be a deeaar?" I swear Ned is just married to everyone. Ariel has to share him with all of the Try Guys
eugene is the asian one?
i have the same shoes as zack :)))
H
GOD DAMN!😍😍
😑
They can walk in heels,I can't even walk in tennishoes
I love how the guys are claiming they look F*** hot, but they walk like a drunk duck...
OMG i laughed SO hard at this!
I was about to click on another video when I heard a voice at the very end and thought wait, who is that? Then I realized that's the sexy sound of a hung over Eugene😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
High heels were originally made for guys, actually.
where can i get eugenes shirt?
I am 4'9", or 146cm to be exact, and I have damaged all my toes through childhood. I absolutely cannot wear heels, and if I try, then I wear wedges for a very short period of time (or sit the entire time). When Zach mentioned his frustration, I feel you, man...
My mum always wares heels and he's no flats
lol, they look so fabulous!
"IM NOT AS THINK AS YOU DRUNK I AM"🎶
the ankle boots actually looked good, like I wish it was more normal for men to wear them lol, they actually were an improvement
7:35 that pose thooo...HAHAH I SHIP ITTT
i feel like they were exaggerating so much... or weren't distributing their weight properly... or have a really low pain tolerance... idek but there's no way the heels hurt that much, esp the short ones
I Love Zack's shoes they are very easy to walk in and they look very good I have those😂
EUGENE DANCING IS MY AESTHETIC
wtf they're all (EuGENE I MEAN EUGEn E) really fuckin hot
Eugene is so fab
They walk like ducks!!
I feel like this has to do with their knees. Like maybe you haven't noticed but usually, when guys are just standing without moving, they tend to slightly bend their knees rather than "lock" them back like girls do (I said USUALLY okay. You can just watch people at a bus stop if you want to check by yourself.) So when they have to walk in high heels it's not a natural position for them, I suppose...
Props to eugene to stay at that heels!🙌🏼 but funny how zack's heels are pretty much my everyday shoes 😂
I love how they went to a stripper/dancer bar - and then they talk about their mothers,sisters and wives
Why do I feel like I watched this exact video two years ago
I love Eugene 😂
I kinda wish the ladies wore heels too. they could have showed off some girl power. no. doubt the ladies would have been a lot better at walking in heels
que Brendon Urie in heels and the song dont thearten me with a good time
really, try guys? you do suffer a lot 😂
I use heels like Eugene has for night out but I wear as high heels with wedge on normal days. I dance ballet. My feet are used to it. I have the muscle in my feet for it. To go straight out to those... I'm amazed he survived. I lift my hat and bow to thee.
masculinity is toxic!
but ladies, 2:32
Is Eugene into girls ?
Heels are the reason I have confidence. When it comes to a point where you can run in 6 inch heels, you know you're going places.
buzzfeed sucks now. like wtf is this though?
Eugene is the best thing about Buzzfeed.
LOVE MY HEELS ! NEVER TAKE THEM OFF !! BUY BEST !!!! THEN SUFFER FOR LOOK!
I have heels higher then the boys even though I am only 10 years old
EUGENE LOOKS SO GOOD
Y'all should do try guys try figure skating
I sware Eugene was secretly having fun in those heels
Everyone is talking about Eugene, but why is no one talking about how cute Zack looked in his little boots??
ZACH LOOKED SO GOOD
WHY CAN EUGENE ON HIGH HEELS STAND BETTER THAN ME ON REGULAR SHOES
The try guy should make each other bentos.
I'll give props to you guys because if it was me I'm probably not even gonna last an hour 😂
And Eugene looks hot.
"I may have made a terrible mistake, but I look hot."
😂😂😂😂
"So when i was challenged to dance, I mutherfuckin' danced " - Eugene 2017-2017
zach is my favorite one
wtf Eugene lol
Low key a girl could wear the exact same outfit, Zach's outfit
Where they find such nice heels to fit the guys? Don't men have a larger foot over all and wider toe spread?
you could look crazy sexy without wearing heals
Eugene is a better woman then I am
Damn Eugene impressed me and I love zach but his shoes were by far the easiest to walk in they weren't even heels more like booties
The girl was probably enjoying that dance with Eugene :,)
My attraction to Eugene continues...
I would only last in Zacks heels... and they are the CUTEST
if i saw these four guys out at the club with heels on and cameras out, i would be so annoyed..
their heels match their personalities on a whole new level
"alright only the hot ones are left, let's do this"
"i almost got hit by a car, that was super chill"
usually i'm eugene but rn zach is meeeee
they definitely lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt guys
eugene would
I love 6" heels. But It's hard to find here. I mean a good stable perfect pair of 6" heels. 
higher than that I never heard before. but in the comment box I read some people discussing 8 and 9 inches. and now I wonder how it's. coz I have always worn 3-6 only. 3 is nothing. but 6 makes you to be a little careful. how does it feel to wear 8 or 9?
1. Eugene looks so attractive in heels I gtg
2. Going straight from high heels to really flat shoes will hurt so make sure the flats are not too flat:)
Is it just me or does Zach look good in heals😂
I can get down with a night out in ankle boots. One their probably comfortable af ( I haven't had a pair yet, so I wouldn't know), and 2, ankle boots are MY personal favorite heels, Except for red bottom stillettos. Give me those daggers.
Eugene is an amazing dancer. That's definitely not something I can do in three inch heels, the highest I own. Hell, I couldn't do that in my flats or Converse.
eugene slays my life 😻😭
ministerio aviva
Even about heals the only thing that matters for Ned it's if it makes his butt looks good
I'd wear what Zach is wearing.
Y'all I'm really hoping Eugene got that girls number
Eugene looks great in every MF video 😘😘😘😘😘
BUT I MAKE THESES HIGH HEELS WORK!
Brendon Burst through the door
Keith and Eugene are my favorites (sorry if I spelled any of their name wrong)
zach was the smartest with those platform boots
Yas Eugene, you're my spirit animal
i use really high heels, but only with a high enough platform. You still look cool and good but your feet aren't that close to the ground so they wont get hit or stepped on and the curve of your feet isn't that bad.
Let's be honest, Eugene looked the hottest
Eugene you sexy beast 😂😂😂😂😂you dance better than most strippers 😂😂😂😂😂😂👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Omg that ending to the last sekond, but eugene did take the worst High heels
I think uegene will rock these and walk perfectly!
Can we not encourage the idea that dancing in stilettos is a normal "female" thing?  Not only is it simply counter intuitive if you want to have an enjoyable night, but you literally become a danger to other sandal-clad women with your dagger feet.  I swear, some of this calling out what "women have to go through" trend is just a subtle way of  encouraging women to make their own lives harder than necessary.  Don't do winged eyeliner or contouring if it stresses you that much.  Wean yourself off fuckboys if they're such a problem.  Wear stilettos for literally anything other than aerobic activity.  Or at least don't expect men to sympathize with your completely voluntary foot pain lol
I could not stop laughing! That phrase is so true. I have seen so many people in so much pain that it is just sad to watch. That is why I choose to not wear heels unless I ABSOLUTELY have to! I am glad that some guys now understand how women feel but I also feel bad for y'all to have had to go through so much pain. Love y'all! Keep up these amazing videos.
I'm actually just here to see all the Don't Threaten Me With A Good Time comments tbh
god, I saw the title of the video and immediately thought of dtmwagt, what has my life come to
wimps ;) Heels aren't that bad, get propper fitting ones and they're okay, even for longer periodes of times. Yes I can walk in heels.
Eugene marry me
ZACH LOOKED SO COOL IN THOSE HEELS LIKE HE DOESN'T EVEN LOOK STRANGE AT ALL
Zach's heels were the cutest thing ever and I think it should be more socially acceptable for men to wear them. Mean should be able I wear everything women can and vice versa, I don't get why all this separation exists.
Every boy needs to do these videos just to see how hard day to day life is being a girl 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Eugine slays harder than anyone I swear. Anyone else thinking ru paul drag race? He would be a legit competition!
The give it a whirl fuckers everybody
Zach : "Uhh I'm like being tall" 😂😂😂
I would walk just like them if I have heels on.
Is Eugene gay?? Is it rude to ask? I'm just curious :) he seems very gayish or maybe bi :)
lol 😆
KEITH BAS A FIANCEE???!?!??! OH MY GOD I AM SO LATE TO THE BANDWAGON WHAT
CONGRATULATIONS!!! May the both of you be as happy as possible for many years to come!!
I like heels, but don't like being taller than everyone else, since I already am tall :( but that would be okay, what I really don't like is that my boyfriend looks even shorter than he is x.x
looks exactly like how I walk in heels 😂😂😂
the only thing they skipped is pregaming and then having to go to dinner and not eat because you can barely fit in your outfit already 😣😂😂
Of course they would party in weho. If they did this in another part of la they be harassed. Well how entertaining anyways. :).
for a wee - wait, whaaaat? a niiiiight? Ha! It is just a sign for how painful high heels are. 
Wear "lalala" for a week. Yeah, right.
guys wearing heels is the equivalent to a dog wearing socks.
2:19 LMAO
It's worst when you have tiny feet and have to add inserts in your heels. Totally changes the dimension inside the heels designed to accommodate feet and gets your toes and part of your feet scrapping against the heels in random places that the shape of the heels would normally not do so.
I wore 6 inch heals to a wedding and kept them off for 9 hours. I was dancing and jumping around for 5 of those hours. my feet were bleeding but who cares
they went to a...strip club??
Heels are not a fashion statement, it's a deathwish
Keith is engaged!!!!
"WHO'S THAT MAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET, WITH THOSE DELICATE FEET? IT'S ZACK!" XD
OH MY GOD THEM MOVES THOUGH
I was at the zoo with my two Korean "sisters" and they walked around in the zoo for about 4 hours in like, 3 inch heels. HOW??????
Zach is a high heel legend
Lol
When Zach dropped it like it's hot 😂😂
Wow.. I'm a girl and these guys walk 2000000 times better than me, I had to have my friend teach me how to walk in  1 1/2 inch heels XD
EUGENE? MORE LIKE YOU QUEEN OML IVE NEVER SEEN SUCH DANCING IN HEELS THAT HIGH
the booties and the dagger heels 😍
Eugine is full of surprises
i ware 6 or 7in heels and i walk perfictly fine.
Eugene is a blessing
Well, heel were invented in days of olde, when moats were sewage and people dumped their waste into the streets. Woman started wearing them to get their feet out of the disgusting sewage. RANDOM FUN FACT!!!!!!😊
The boots!! I love them! But i cant get them because I would probably give them away and go back to my sneakers and flip flops   i dont care about not looking hot anymore i just want to be comfy
Eugene's shirt is everything, I WANT ONE!
'You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels' LOL that was so funny
why tf does eugene look better then me in high heels????? plus that dancing tho damnnn
if your going to heels those boots with the fat heels are the most comfy BY FAR
I WAS SCREAMIGN WHEN EUGENE WAS DANCING OH MY GODDDDDD
they wore heels way too big, when you wear heels, specialky with open toed heels, you need to buy one size or two sizes smaller. Glue two toes together, and wear little "shoe cushions"
Okay but where did Ned get his heels? I need them
zach probably made the smartest choice out of all of them when picking heels
Zach's shoes are the only ones I would likely last a full night in
I have walked 9 hours in heals HA I WIN
At 6:27 Eugene got down!!!!! I want to wear those heels now!!
Eugene should wear heels everyday 😍😍😍
It's official, Eugene is sexy in absolutely everything 😂
Zack needs to get punched in the face. Those short squatty ankle boots should not have been a problem and should have lasted all night.
I like the boots,no but I also hate heels I mean  seriously have you people seen what the crap does to your  feet
When the pills just popped in and they workin better then ever 6:08
"Because the stiletto is so tall, it'll camera zoom motherfuckin' kill you."
YAY!! Keith, congrats!!!
Don't worry if your sisters and mom aren't proud of you cause I am lol
Who else just screamed.....





BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
WHAT IS EUGENE'S SEXUALITY?!?
I once wore 3 in heels for 5 hours without taking them off. I was 12...
6:24 Who I think I am
6:29 Who I really am
Ned is so freaking adorable omfg 😂💕
Damn Zach looks good in those boots
I wear heels and honestly I feel the heel to toe is so not the right way to walk , anyone else feel this way too?
So fabulous
For a next video with the Try Guys, please have them go into a Primark in Britian (maybe in a different place for each of them), and with only £150, they must buy clothes for themselfs that they like, andaybe as a competition to see how has least amount after; and also they react to if they like Primark in Britian, because many women of all ages really like it, but you never see what men think of Primark, so it woulx be intresting to see each of them do a haul and their opinions and if they would go again. Hope this helps ans is a intresting idea. 😆😆👍👕👖👔👞
The Try Guys have to dance in heels, inspired by the Britains Got Talent video of the three french guys dancing in womens heels. Each of them havd to learn the routine from the video of their audition, or from a professional. 😆😁😁
Zach was lucky
Oh dear those booty makes a girl jealous😂 these guys pull off heels soo well
You guys looked awesome hot 😱😱
Eugene dancing.. wow 😱  what a night 😂
I want to see them in point shoes. (bellet shoes... but like on the tip toes..)
Of course Eugene who hates hugs and Christmas wears the fricken dagger heels 🙄😂
zack looked so good! and if they made him more confident, i support him wearing heels more often
At least Zach almost got hit by a Rolls Royce, so the guy will have the money to pay for his hospital bills.
zach's shoes are so good + go with his outfit + could be worn on the reg and i'm a fan
Eugene is ❤❤❤❤❤😍
When u are a Panic! song irl
When I wear heels...I actually have my flats in the bag
eugene, you are brave my friend
Oh, yes. Eugene's heels are amazing! I would honestly wear those.
T'nail
Ned and zack are my favorite guys on the series they look so alike and their personalities are the same as me
in which,  zach was the sensible one
8:06  a stripper bar..... nice job guys
here in scotland THE 12 YEAR OLD AND UNDERS CAN WALK IN HEELS BETTER THAN THEIR PARENTS TAKE THAT FROM ME -12 AND MY SISTER -7
My friends are drag queens and without heels a couple of them are like 6ft4 - with heels they are nearly 7ft tall and they can walk/dance/death drop in heels perfectly meanwhile I can't wear heels for any length of time - hate those buggers haha
Okay but Zach's entire look is super cute with those lil booties. I would wear the hell out of that outfit.
I feel so uncomfortable seeing Eugene and his heels
I think men in heels is my new favourite aesthetic! Wear dem heels boys!
Uber nerds
And that is why I have never once wore heels a single day in my life.
The try guys, worth is and unsolved are the only reason I still watch buzzfeed. They all need to go solo and make their own chanels.
Zack with the ankle boots looked the best
1:11 my fiance painted my t'nails
"I got catcalled" .... he said "welcome to the real world" not "lemme see them tiddies"
Always tape/bandaid your toes before going out in stilettos.
1:11 "My fiance painted my tuh-NAILS."
you guys are weak. im 13 and went to a family event with 4 inch stiletto heels and walked the entire time. the event was from 12-6. my feet didnt even hurt, im naturallt good with heels (including 6 inch, my limit for those is after 2 hours of wearing them.)
"You pop on four extra inches, guess what, I can't compete with that."

Phrasing! Boom!
06:28 I'm legit dying
I'm thirteen and wear 4 inches pretty much everyday 🤣😂
That's something my husband would do every weekend at home lol just to make me laugh
"Welcome to the real world" Ned: Oooooo
Eugene is crazy wth I would never wear these😂
the only things that hold me to watch buzz feed because of eugene, ned, zach and keith... if not because of them i already quit watching this channel
I love how the others just went with 2-3 inch heels and eugene went the high route with 6 inches
I. can.  walk in. heels.  and. I'm.  7. years. old
"ONLY the hot ones are left" Sorry Ned, but Zac got out, PLUS you're still there. JK, love all them handsome men ❤
EUGENE IS BEAUTIFUL
EUGENE KILLED IT THOUGH AND HE HAD THE WORST AND MOST PAINFUL HEELS
2:32 IM CRYING
Eugene can even get laid with women's heels on. Wow.
Eugene can even get laid with women's heels on. Wow.
I love Eugene soooo much
Ned has the easiest
this was so funny
how has zach not found a partner HE IS PRECIOUS
I'm already annoyed at how fabulous Eugene is compared to me (as usual) 😑
"I may have made a terrible mistake....but i look hot" 
Me Be Like: ...HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
I knew that's Eugene's leg in the thumbnail not because there's eugene's face but beacuse of those Hairs on his legs 😂😂😂
Of course Eugene gets the 6 inch heels lol I would NEVER!
lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but i make these high heels work XD
the try guys should try mermaid swimming with the tails and all the props!
yOooOooO eugune!!! 2:32
dont kill me ok thnkz
Eh I wouldn't count the ankle boots as high heels.. but I guess they're good for beginners
Guys can look great in heels... once they get over that walking part where they look like they pissed themselves that is.
Dayum Eugene geeettt itt
Their at at strip club
OMG i have the exact same ones as Zach :)
I have had and experience with six inch heels and it was straight up hell
i can handle 3 inch though. But i stay away anything that goes up to 3.
Did Eugene come out of closet?
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK!
Eugene is soo extra omg I love it hahaha
Zach's heels were the most comfortable looking and also the best looking one. Smart boy. 

I usually only wear wedges but even then, I just need to take it off and walk barefoot after a couple of hours. I completely understand the bliss on Keith's face.
Eugene's dancing omg!!!
Eugene is my spirit animal
Jesus I don't know if there drunk or there like that 








Thats awesome XD
MAN NED IS ROCKING THOSE HEELS
Eugene wearing a shirt with their names on it 😂❤️
Vaginas around the world just synced up watching this vid
Um??? Zach's outfit with the booties was so cute ??? I want that outfit
7:48 that is art.
EUGENE AND NED LOOK SOOO GOOD WTF
6:23 oh my glob 😂😂
is Eugene gay?
Me walking down the street seeing them I would literally run to them like ahhhhhhh!
there was a male stripper in the back
i wear the shoes Zach wore, except I do it for about 7 hours every day. :p
I find them comfy
2:31 YAAAAASSSS QWEEEEEENNNNN SLAAAAAYYYYYY
wow they last longer than me in heels lol i cant even wear a six inch heel without tripping over
Keith's fiance is soooo cute
2:29 OMG EUGEEEEEEENEEEEEEE
Eugene got laid that night
Of course Keith's toenails were painted blue...
Okay, but Zach, the style thats hes rocking. I love it.
Eugene's sexuality? nun of y'all business
My feet hurt just looking at Eugenes heels.
Okay.

Zach went smart.
Keith went cute.
Ned went with the booty poppers.
And Eugene went crazy.
New video idea:
*ahem*

"The Try Guys Try To Find SOMETHING that Eugene Doesn't Look Good In Or Pull Off Or Do Flawlessly Cuz OH MY GOD THAT MAN LOOKS AMAZING IN ANYTHING AND CAN DO EVERYTHING LIKE WTFH"
I love how extra is Eugene
OMG I knew Eugene would be extra af!
Keith looks like a dude you just want to pat on the the head when he just finished a test about the most random stuff Ned would think about.
i can wear heels and i'm fine for like 3 hours after that it hurts i war 4-5-6  inch heels
Im getting leafy on this
I feel extra bad for Eugene bc his heels look like they're too big and lord knows it's twice as difficult to walk in heels that don't fit, especially when they're that crazy!!!
I think try guys should try driving manual shifts for a week.
"You pop on 4 inches, how am I supposed to complete with that"
Me (when the guys say they can't walk and when Eugene complains about the daggers that are six inches): BOYS, MOVE OVER!!! When I was a child people asked if I wanted to look good or be fast. I went be catwomam. Now I CAN SPRINT IN NINE INCH HEELS AND FEEL NO PAIN!!!!!
All I could think about while watching this was Bongyoung.. dancing.. in.. heels.. how did he do it.
Eugene reminded me of tye guy who danced to Wiggle in high heels
of course Eugene out does everyone. He outheeled and outdanced them! XD
4 inch heels all day isn't bad. (I was wearing Doc Martains)
Why tf does Eugene look fabulous in everything?
Eugene is my Queen
All I kept thinking about was Prince. That man makes heels look DELICIOUS. Good job trying, guys lol.
9:18-9:19 was that shangela and laganja?
So is Ned gonna start wearing heels more, because he looked good in them (and he actually made sensible heel decisions)
Zach, the only one with any sense. If you're wearing heels, low boots are the best way to go.
If you're ever driving and you see four men walking across the road it's either drag queens...or the try guys
high heel were made for men actually haha
I hate heels but I love flat heels, you know the sandals with high flat heel? Idk 😅
I think it's cool how the shoes represent  them like Eugene always looks the most fierce
Oh, Zach... you are so adorable I CAN'T HANDLE IT ❤❤❤
My rule is you're married to your heels once you leave the house. Divorce only happens when you return home 😅
but of course eugene still rocks it 😂😂😂 and zack got lucky with the booties, prolly the easiest to wear.
zach is the only smart one
I didn't know I needed this 😂
so I can never understand why people say it hurts
is it weird that whenever I were 👠 they never hurt even if I were it for 2 hours
I want to marry Eugene so hard. He can wear the heels, too.
Zach chose the easiest heels, but he also looked the best in then so... shrug
Why are these people acting like heels are horribly painful? They're not that bad.
the blond wife looks like the main character from the shannara chronicles!😱
" You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels " 
Actually laughing so hard lmaoooo
Is Eugene gay?
0:50 those don't look bad at all on him
Oh my lord they all look so good in heels 😂👌🏼 and I'm a wanna be drag qween 😬 looks so rewarding 😂
I heard heels originally made for men..i can see that working especially with zachs booties. not bad ....
PLZ TELL ME ZACH WILL BE WEARING MORE CUTE HEELS IN FUTURE VIDEOS
Zach had it soooooooooo easy
I thought the gauntlet was cancelled because Steve killed all his campers?
I hate heels so much because they give you so many health problems, not just to your feet but to your whole body.
To all the panic at the disco fans out there: I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but I make these high heels work!
When Eugene was dancing I was like "MAKE HIM STOP,END MY SUFFERING"  XD
I want a man like this
6:11 lol 😂
6 inches is more than people think XD
six inch heeeeeeeels
he walked in the club like nobody's busineeeess
I have to survive 8 hours of work on high heels.
Who was the girl Eugune was dancing with
Eugene:"They will motherf***ing kill you"
Me:"true, very true."
Remember heels were originally designed for men.
the longest I have ever been in heels was from 7p.m till 8a.m 
once I took them off it felt as if I had 1000 needles in my feet, every step hurt like a mofo
from where are these shoes?
my feet can feel the blisters from those strappy shoes and my ankles are dying just looking at Eugene walk
weak.
Zach and I have the same taste in shoes.
i rewatched this video just to see eugene dance
So relatable guys! Love you. And Eugene, does are some crazy-ly hot dance moves! Bravo! And you were so hot on heels ;P
"you got two entrées?"
"I was hungry"
"You cant tell me what to eat when im wearing heels"
I want this on my tombstone
YAS EUGENE QUEENNNNNN
Eugene would be such a good drag queen 😂❤️
zack wore the most comfortable heel EVER!! 
i would like to see keith in eugene's 6 inch heel hahaha
Eugene is sexy as f*ck!!! I would hit it for sure! Haha especially with him looking like a total bro in that hat
girls have it sooooo much harder then boys.. and if your a boy and you tell me I'm wrong... I will stab you with my heels 😂😏
when he threw those shoes in the dumpster I almost had a panic attack!
"Nope not wasted, just wearing heels" is actually my life motto as a short, clumsy human.
omg I frickin love walking in dagger stilettos
"THE DAGGER STRIKES" is my superhero line now.
I ONLY live in heels lol
This is wonderful
EUGENE THE STRIPPER
Of course Eugene wore dagger heals lol
can we appreciate how comfortable the try guys are with their masculinity
i loved eugenes and zachs shoes. they really matched their outfits
Only here because of a Yuri on Ice edit of this video
Wow. Eugene has talent,
i wanna be eugene when i grow up
2:46 PUPPY
They make it look so easy...
eugene is me while dancing😂😂😂😂
did they lose a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt? because they make those high heels work
So acting gay has really taken off in the US.
lol I take mine off for a minute and wear flats XD
Eugene motherfuckin danced!
Eugene could give me herpes and I would thank him
It's all about the heel you get. They can look good and still be comfy.
Just a continuation of Eugene having to one up everyone😂😂
its risegum
when ur seriously out of an idea for a video...
The only thing i can think of is:
"I lost a bet to a guy in chiffon skirt, but i make these high heels work!"
Zach actually looks good
sees ankle boots heels

Me: whispers Prince.
men in high heels are hot
I'm Eugene..... and Ned
the try guys should go on the fastest rollercoasters🎢
I was once wearing high heels at the mall, but I got a blister on my heel so I had to walk with my friends barefooted lmao
this is me every time i go out even though i never wear heels because i have scoliosis so the pain is there when the heels arent
May your feet rest in peace
This is why i wear flats, slippers or sneakers to the club.
I can't even wear 4 inches stilettos I feel like a failure compared to Eugene
7:57 I wish that rolls royce would hit me...
I got this app called hellopet and it was standing on Eugene Keith Ned and Zach
my fiance painted me t-nails
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work  - Brendon  urie
What a discovery, wow.
Zac was smart and wore boots
Can someone please tell zach about shoe inserts that make men look taller, I feel like he would really like those
That face that Keith made. "Sittin's great" :3
Eugene slays all day 😂
Eugene dancing with that girl was highkey sexy as hell
I was way too excited about Ariel.
2 best feelings in the world are, taking off your bra, and taking off your heels after a night out
"Whose that man walking down the street with those delicate feet, it's Zack!" XD
8:05 a stripper?????
Zach is so Hot wearing his Ankle Heals
Best thumbnail
I swear Eugene can pull off anything
thats so gay
Salam alaikoum. I hope you support me in my channel. I am a Moroccan girl writing poetry
hahahaha i love that Eugene goes all out
this channel is pathetic
"my heels for tonight are actually called dagger pumps, because the heel is so tall, they'll motherfuckin' kill you.
I would like to report that on your snapchat thingy that todays post about Disney was weid because that you wrote a dog walking a dog but i would like to inform you that Goofy is not a dog but Pluto to is so you information is incorrect !
CAn we get a full video of Eugene dancing in bars
So when I was challenged to dance... I motherfuckin danced. 👢


Can I get that on a poster for my room please? Please?
Poor Eugene. 😂
'Who's your spirit animal?'
'Ned from Buzzfeed'
literally everyone i know wears trainers when they go out haha but props to them for giving it a go!!
honestly zach should wear boot heels all the time he looked really good 🔥🔥
eugene is great on heels
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt.
But I make these high heels work!
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
eugene's heels remind me of violet chachki.
"The Stilletos are so tall, they'll *** Kill you" lol His face XD
next one -  The Try Guys try bugchasing.
I hate high heels so very much.
Eugene, the queen of fashion
Zach and Eugene looks SO HOT
I give Eugene mad props. Yass queen lol
i ship zach and eugene so hard you don't even know
Zack's choice was the best
dude tho eugene was doing it with THOSE SHOES /and/ too big for him, i'm impressed
They *look* good..... but they are only practical for about 10 minutes. I never wear anything over 5cms high. They hurt otherwise!
according to the English dictionary, High Heels = the opposite of Ultra Boost.
I'm sorry maybe not, Because Ultra Boost are both comfortable and good looking, my bad.
You see, if you wear heels to the club. You have to get drunk! that way you don't feel your feet when you're dancing.
I don't admit it usually but i really like men in heels.
lol eugene rocks every challenge
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD
Face plant 😂
ZACK WHY DID YOU FLAT OUT YOU HAD COMFOTABLE SHOES
they dont know how to walk in heels 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol Zack has the best shoes for a night out because they aren't stilettos.
DAMNNNN EUGENE U GO BOI!! But srsly Eugene was poppin😆👌💧
"That tush has gOT THE PUSH" Keith you're killing me!!
I bet Eugene wanted to take that girl home but because he is competitive he said goodbye
All thing aside, props to Eugene for using double the heel height of everyone else
Coz 5" without platform is usually the top of the line, and even then not a lot of girls use that
Zack--ankle boots?? Come on! You're supposed to get the full high heel experience! You totally wussed out. Ankle boots don't count. Eugene was the clear winner.
Zach and Eugene looked so good jfc
They wear high heels better than I do.
OKAY, zack looked great
2:31-2:33 Omg.
Eugene is fabulous.
When guys wears heels better than you..
Haha..
I love Eugene
ARIEL IS SO CUTE !!
I'm turning 12 and I ware 4 inch high heels to school and ware them all day even when I play tag at lunch (never do) anyway these girls should be able to last at least 7,8 hours in heels 👠
of course Eugene gotta be extra and get bigger ones than everyone else.
see Zach was the smartest I always wear closed toe chunky heels because they are so much more comfortable
"Who's that man walking down the street with those delicate feet, it Zach " I giggled
"there's a lot of uneven terrain" the motherfuckin struggle, i feel you on another level
The heels look best on Eugene(holyschmokes) and Zach.
these guys are whimps I'm a part time drag queen like I've worn dagger heels from 5am to 8pm  and I'm fat as hell but I rock it
If you follow me on Instagram k_c__lynch I will sub to your channel
the hot asian guy looks great in heels
Next Up;The Try Guys try waterboarding!
Prince was one of the few men who rocked them heels and still got any girl
lmao i wear 4 inch heels to school every single day and everyone always asks "oh my god dont ur feet hurt???" and i say no because my feet have become numb to the pain
ned = charlie price
Zach looked SO good with those ankle boots
This is cringeworthy, 200%
is silently able to wear heels 8+ hours normally and still is able to party.
I'm 6 foot tall, if I even attempt to wear heels I look like a man in bad drag.
Eugene took the saying "go big or go home" too literally lol.
Zach and Keith: 3 inches=kind of bad
Ned: 4 inches=ouch end the pain
Eugene:6 inches=HOLY MOTHER OF-
when our got heels that boots got push😂
3.75" heels is the maximum for me. if i'm paying money for heels, i better be able to wear them all day without wanting to kill myself or others.
eugene MAKES HEELS LOOK BETTER HOW?????????
I would just like to say this is way harder when your feet are like 6 inches long to begin with
Eugene manages to make even heals hot. and i struggle to pull off a belt.
I love how Ned just chucked his heels into the dumpster
"I'm a forward thinking man, I'm responsible. So I'm gonna get drunk." -Zack
Heels for me are not painful at all.Maybe cause I can't fit them XD
This is why Prince died.
zachs outfit was really cute i would wear the whole thing and he should wear it more often
noob
ZACH LOOKS SO GOOD THO
Eugene Got Tooooo Comfortable Lmaoo
I like zacks shoes
ok but Zach looks really cute in those boots
could never be me XDDDDDDDDDD
I wore open toed shoes one time on my bus, and my feet accidentally got rolled over by a rolling backpack.
Poor Keith and Ned!
Eugene is fine!! Zack....I love him!!!
Of course Eugene would pick those heels  😂 😂 😂
Don't women know that high heals are a choice?
Those boots are so not even heels lol. They're easy af to walk in.
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
you think that's pain? Im a size 9 and the only thing (for a choir concert) that was wear-able (somehow?) was a size 4...and they were heels!
Eugene dancing gave me life
😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️zac
oooohhh the pain!
Zach got so lucky
I knew Eugene would be in this vid

And he would go big
This is my favourite Try Guys video EVeR
I feel like Eugene could rock heels.
And that's  why I always wear crocs
When your low key wondering how RDJ managed in heels for almost every MARVEL Movie
they should try japanese fashion
zach had the best shoes to wear lol comfortable and stylish
eugene dancing was goals
8:04 ope, um . strip club alert
Zach and Eugene actually pulled the heels off really well and stayed almost until 2 while Eugene was wearing daggers the other two quit and theirs werent even that high. Also Zach SLAAYYYED those boots tho.
Zach: "Only the hot ones are left"
Me: *Agrees
Keith is such a babe honestly
In Argentina platforms are really popular whether they are high or low, and you can totally dance from 23 to 6 am
Can I have Zacks shoes?? ❤️🙏
These girls are mean. They didn't tell the boys to get thick soles to cushion the blow
4:21 
TWO OF HEARTS! TWO HEARTS THAT BEAT AS ONE!
I LOVE THAT SONG!
SOFT AND NEAT
OH MY GOD EUGENE DANCING IS AMAZING IM DYING
Eugene is such a great actor. He doesn't have any problems walking with heels as Kimora Blac in RuPaul's Drag Race. I see you dude.
Mmmh, Eugene
They lost a beg to a guy in a chiffon skirt. But they make those high heels work 😉
They wear heels better than me.
Now the try guys know how the women's and girl feel with heel.👠👡👢👣😏and I'm just only 9
god Eugene. I love you.
Why do women do this to themselves on a daily basis?  #Fuckthepatriarchy
6:23 I SHIP IT ! 😂😂😂😂
I have the same boots Zack wore lol
How do you make your mom proud
Me "Get into a good college and keep a great career"
Eugene "Where dagger heels"
ARE SOME OF THE GUYS WEARING TYPE 1 DIABETIC PUMPS??????!!!!!! I'M TYPE 1 ALSO!!!!!!!
That moment when Eugene looks better in high heels than you.
I LOVE Eugene so much , he slayed in those heels!
my feet hurt
Eugene is wildin
i'm here trying to ignore the fact that Eugene walks in heels better than i do lol
Ned's wife CAN GET IT.
And drunk Eugene dancing was LIFE, it was incredible! 😍😍
i would marry Zack
I was beat by a guy in a chaffron skirt but I make these high heels work
They are hotter than I am with heels and I am a girl...WOOOW
Zach's shoes actually went with his outfit! LOVED IT. I would wear EVERYTHING he had on.
heels are hell  lol
I have an ankle problem that makes it so I can't wear heels. Part of me is sad, because my fiance is 6'3 and I'm 5'1, and part of me is 100% okay with not being able to wear heels
06:43 are they at a male strip club? lol
Zach's zippers being on the outside bugged me
if zach wouldve gotten hit, atleast it wouldve been by a rolls royce
Eugene is the only one who actually wore great heals
Try Guys vs LadyLike 🤷🏼‍♀️
Lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt,
But I make these high heels work
"Partying with the Try Guys" is definitely on my bucket list!
So why would girls like to wear high heels? A lot of girls complain about their lives on heels, if you hate it just don't wear it.
Up next: Try guys do Pointe Shoes 💁🏼
the fact that eugene walks in heels better than i do
soft and neat
Uhh when uegen danced sry if spelt wrong that was a stranger and look at his dance moves ;-;
(•—•)
Uegene wtf did u did (•—•
Eugene said motherfuck so many times in this video.
When I was 8, my mom bought me 1 inch heels. I loved  them but when we had parties I couldn't run around with my cousins. I still have them.
little tip boys and girls: Shoulders Back and Hips Out. Also the higher the heel the more hip swaying needed to stay balanced
i want zachs.. those are so much better
heey, yes, you, who is reading this. i have a question, i am dutch so that makes me??
 ⬇let me know
미쳤넼ㅋㅋ 유진이 신은 신발 조녜...
You have to say though they have nice asses lol 😂👍🏻
Zach-2017'add on 4 extra inches and I can't compete with that.'
Zac cheated with those ankle boots
zach's shoes actually look good with his outfit
I seriously wish guys would wear heels more often. They look feckin incredible!!
Eugene had to put up with the most pain
its official, im in love with eugene
most of the boy's i know are shorter than me and if they stand next to me i feel tall (I'm 1.83 cm) sometime i hate my life
EUGENE WAS SLAAAAAAYING
I love Zack's boots! I would totally wear them!
ned slimmed down?
get bofferlow show instead... :-P
i think the are all gay
y'all need some platforms.
I actually love men wearing heels, it makes them look more fearless than they are .
I'm from Glasgow and if you take off your heels you can get stopped by the police because when you carry them they are classed as a weapon, glasgows a friendly place
High heels are just bad for your feet and knees.
All this talk about 6 inches
I'm pretty sure Eugene's shoes were too big, you could see a huge gap between his heel and the back of the shoe
0:16 don't 😂😂
So funny you guys.
Zach looked good in those shoes
Anyone else notice the car he was almost hit by was a rolls Royce?
Eugene is trying to break his ankles. I swear!
When Eugene starts dancing with that girl😂 it's like, he dances better than me when I'm wearing flats🤣
eugene has high heels and still pick up a girl respect
in sweden we have like our own mcdonalds and it is called MAX maybe they should try it
Eugene was the unluickeis
Zach was the luckiest
Someone Is Here to reply me?
😂😂😂
I wouldn't have lasted as long as Eugene tbh
The try guys go emo for a day
I wanna see more of Eugene dancing with those heals XD
other guys would so think that you are gay!
When zach did dropped in the beginning I died 😂😂😂😂
fun fact high heels ere made for men. butchers particularly, were made so they didnt step in blood.
Try guys try figure skating
Everyone here is sad that all the try guys look better in heels than you will ever
Eugene makes everything hot🔥
for some reason i think heels r super easy to walk in. and zacks heels r really easy to walk in
#sosexy
I've been Eugene in this video more times than I care to admit...
LOL I could not stop laughing
"My fiancé painted my 'tnails'"
Did you know that when heels were made they were actually made for men
okay where do i find zach's boots
I love Eugene lmao
Super proud of Eugene for lasting that long in six-inch heels 😂
This video just seeing their hairy legs & their big feet wearing heels 🤣😂🤣😂
I wanna dance with Eugene ❤❤❤
who else was completely dying of laughter 6:23 😂😂😂
Heels were originally made for men lol
Eugene looked beautiful in heels
I have a problem but I look hot Lol
Only Eugene would  wear  those 😂😂
i could wear heals for 12 hours straight
Shoutout to Zach for being the only one who picked sensible heels. Idk what TF the rest of them were thinking.
Zach was definitely the most sensible with shoe choice
tbh they look cute
but i MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK only few know
It's not a vid without Ned asking, "but don't they make my butt look good?"
Can we just appreciate how the biggest problem these guys faced was the pain involved in wearing heels and not, like, the "emasculation" of them wearing heels (in public, no less) ! ♥
"My toes are bleeding...but I look hot"
bet they lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt but they made those high heels work like beebo
Becky's looking very fine with all that smile! Perfect for Keith! Katie looks as if she wants to laugh at them really hard! I don't feel left out anymore! But... Ariel! Look at her stare! If ned gets hit by a car, she'll sense it fast and get in her car and carry him to the hospital when behind her, there's explosions! This should be a movie! It should be named, "Ariel, Part of Her World!"
1:44 BRROOOOOOOMAANCE
Heels have been my bane since becoming a model! People always ask, "How do you walk so well in heels!?". Literal training, and behind the scenes crying.
I like how when they put the heels on they automatically assume "the position"
Eugene 😏
Eugene 😏
It baffles me that people will willingly wear somethin' when they suffer as a result.
I love you Eugine
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
i love zach's shoes
I can run comfortably in 4in heels
I'm 13
is that weird?🤔


nah! I'm just a boss😎
I like the daggers😂😂😂😂😂
I love high heels but I have probablies with my ankles so when I put them on I can't walk so I'm sad cuz of that
"But I look hot" LOLOLOLLOLOLOLO
6:30   I'm dying 😆
Tuhnails
LOLLLLLLLLLL
When Ned and Keith threw those heels in the dumpster I freaked out for like 5 seconds because that sh*t ain't cheap!, but then Keith said: "We should grab those shoes tho, they were expensive" and I felt sooooo relieved😂
Asian guy yes you are hit in heels
So if Eugene was a girl he would were these in every outfit
2:29 DAMN
Eugene can dance so sexy my god YAS Eugene YAS
6 inches deym I only wear 3-5 inches heels
You can't tell me what to eat when I'm eating heels
Zach's look is so good with the boots
Eugene owned those heels. he was looking like a god damn diva when he entered that room! lol I love it.
At 5:48 you can see the lady dancing on the pole THERE AT A STRIP CLUB!
"Don't" 
😂😂
Is Keith getting married???!!!
"The stiletto is so tall, they'll motherfucking kill you" sounds like a play I was in called Homicide in Heels, I was the murderer and got to stab people with my heels
yaaas
This generation is fucked...
why eugene is so hot, i don't get how he can slay always like oh my gad boi
Do a video of 35 uses of lube
The Try Guys must inhale helium
i worn high heels since i was 4 ;D
I would only wear highheels for a photoshooting or maybe for a visit at a restaurant and nowhere else, they just hurt sooo much - Real torture devices, spot on! 👠
why did this remind me of Brendon Urie from PATD!
i wish someone had like, taught them how to walk in heels tho, that was almost painful to watch
i love how their in a strip club 😂😂😂
Oh my gooooood, that buttdrop!!!! Eugene slays it every single Time!!!! 😱😱😱😆😆😆😍😍😍
"I've never had a buckle so tiny" 😂
Kind of dig Eugene's heels
Zach was smart to wear the boots
Eugene just rocks everything! So unfair! 😂❤️
welcome to our world ...our world of pain
Entertaining when High heels were originally created for men in royalty.
Zachs boots... Like, Harry styles would wear those
So, Buzzfeed get males to try on 'stereotypically' girl items of clothing and its funny.
But when they get girls to try 'stereotypically' boy items of clothing, NO THAT IS NOT OK, WHY ARE YOU ASSUMING THAT ONLY MEN CAN WEAR THAT U SEXIST PERSON!!!
Feminists..
Eugene Danced Like Crazy ;o; xD
3" heels are not "kitten" heels...Kitten heels are under 2".Zach was definitely the most sensible one. But damn those dagger heels did nice things for Eugene's backside. Fashion and function. T-T Why can't they get along?
Eugene is the definition of extra
I love how Keith's fiancee is just so accepting of every weird thing he does. Keith decides to wear heals, she paints his toe nails.
Omg I love Eugene ❤
THIS is why I am wearing Toms to my wedding! Comfort over style any day!
Welll...... heels were originally made for men sooooo... who cares
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SHIRT, BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORKK. (This was directed to Eugene, k)
"I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt. But I make these high heels work." No? Just me?
Damn... Eugene making those high heels work
I love how Eugene is wearing a shirt with their names on it 😂
I would date Zach tbh
"Fuckin people!"-Zack
I am 19 years old girl and I have never wear high heels because I am soo scared
I swear Ned should teach all males a lesson "you can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels"
once i wore my moms heels i nearly feel down the stairs it was not FUN
me when i wake up in the morning and im still tired but i have to go to school and eeryone is there awake and chatting and im like- 8:02
I keep laughing during the video, anyway,  I wonder why they don't use bikini then walking on the street with high heels , it is defenitely hillarious
I'm loving Zach's and Ned's shoes but Eugene. As soon as I saw the length of those heels, I could already feel the pain in my legs.
If you can only see around four toes in those heels then where does the number seven come from lol
Fack Bazzfud i fackung Hiet bazzfieud
instead of saying toe nails keith said tanails
Zach looks REALLY good in heels. I think he should wear them more often.
I am here for Eugene finally, FINALLY, not being good at something
'Pop on four extra inches and guess what, I can compete with that'
Same boo.. Same..
But I can also pop on five inch heels and slay😊
(I'm pretty short... Sporting 5'3)
My goal in life is to drunk dance with Eugene at some point
Their shoes totally match their personality. ^^
The feeling that in heels u wanna impress people more  . ... Yeap!! that is right🙄👠👠
Zacks heels were cute
~try guys try horse riding 
~try guys mind puppies for a week 
~try guys try periods
"What advice do you have for us?"
"Don't."
PERFECT
Now, Guys respect women wearing high heels.
I badly want Eugene's "Keith & Ned & Zach & Eugene" t shirt!
Who else heard an Orange Caramel song in there??
only eugene would do that to himself though
Ok ankle boots are nothing compared to what the others got 😂😂
ofc Eugene got dagger heels
Zack slayed in heels. He actually is hot af
If my friends wore these he'd make a hole on the floor
I wanna see them in platform stilettos
The fact Ned's wife took him to a strip club is amazing.
I love that whenever anyone puts on high heels, their inner divas come out 😂 Regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality etc. they all turn into the sassiest divas ever when they strap themselves up in the shoes and it's amazing~
Of course, Eugene had to get the hardest heel to wear; yet still slays it better than most people I know :)
Damn yougen
I kinda wanna see the Try Guys wear booty shorts for a week xD
Eugene: *drops*
Me: Well sweet mother of god I promised not to fall for another guy
Lucky for Eugene he only got bleeding is his right foot while mine was a hurting and bleeding nose on the left I did not pick my nose on that time
im smart I wear wedges so its fashionable and comfortable... but I also have heels and they are comfortable maybe because I walk on my toes all the time???
I have the EXACT nail varnish Keith was wearing on his toes.
Eugene 😍
Dont worry Ned i can relate to the chair thing
Eugene is SO HOT
Of course Keith would pick the Highest heels
i think eugene won at this bcuz look at the freakin highheels even though zach lasted the longest
Zach's shoes don't even count as high heels
Damn Eugene, you don't wear your sit and look pretty heels out on the town. That's rule #1 dawg
6 inch heals are for going to dinner and that's it lol
Comfortable, lower heels are for walking from bad to bar and dancing 

Last week I went out and my friend let me wear a pair of her heels, they were about 3 or 4 inches tall, which isn't very high for me, but they weren't my size. We walked to get a taxi, about a block away and I was already having trouble. Long story short, I got giant blisters on the bottom of my feet and big toes, that still haven't healed up and I got an infection because one popped. Size matters 😭
demonitize buzzfeed
I feel like Zach actually looked good in his.
ZACK LOOKED SO GOOD THO
the damn cane 😂😂😂
I'm with Eugene; im wearing 6 inches heels all night xD
I wonder how many times Eugene got catcalled
LOL! That's right! When i'm wearing heals i don't want to hear lip about what i'm eating^^
Oh come on, Zac's heels were nothing.
they should try the hole look like the make up, the outfit, the heels, and the breasts to try it all and they should do there own makeup
I love u buzz feed
"Somebody bumped into me and stepped on MY TOE" lmaoo
eugene's dancing 😂😂😂
Did anyone else get a chill down their spine at the sight of the six-inch heels?
Zach's heels is much easier to wear than the other try guys and eugene has the hardest to wear
Eugene!!! <3
I love how meanwhile the guys on the choker video were so embarrassed by it, these guys are rocking these heels without a care in the world
Eugene really was the real winner considering he had the highest heels. One had a boot heel and the others had kitten heels those are nothing compared to high stilettos
Who is that other girl in the vid there's Ned's wife and Keith's girlfriend who's the other one??
" I usually don't fall when I stand."
- don't threaten me with a good time
Puts the meaning in it.
I find taking the heels off after an hour or two super satisfying. Also I can run in heels. That's cool. My feet hurt though.
Is it weird that I high-key want man heels to be a thing? It's sexy.
yo, i wanna see one of the other try guys live with ned's wife for a week.
but why does Zach look really trendy
Mozarts Requiem was a nice touch at that part with the dagger ones
ZACH, WHERE DID YOU BUY YOUR BOOTS. I WANT THEM.
buzzfeed, more like cuck feed. every try guys episode is like, how can we emasculate these cucks even more???
I really wish you'd make a video trying out the VOCALOID Software
He is sexy in those  dagger pumps...
Eugene dancing is all I needed
Somebody give Zak the timberland heels i think hed like them
Kieth (snap snap) HAAANDSOMME
I love this 😂
lol. I haven't worn heels in a year. and that was for my bffs wedding. for like a day.
Wait... Eugene doesn't like Christmas???
"You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels"
-Ned, 2017
Eugene lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But he make those high heels work
Zach's outfit with those heels were GREAT
She's beauty, she's grace, she's Eugene
is it just me or do they look like dogs when they have socks on when they walk 😂
I'm a guy and when I wear heals I'm much more of a Eugene, surprisingly graceful. (Btw Eugene, your weak. I only have 6in heals, grow some callouses)
"Nope, not wasted,
Just wearing heels."
I wore heels to homecoming and broke my foot
if you're going to go 6 inch you go platform and chunky heel
love that mic pack @ 2:36
8:00, yup that's a phantom
did you know that heels were originally made for men riding horses?
"Not wasted, just wearing heels." XD
Everybody looks good in high heels
😂😂😂 I need my guy friends to do this so they stop telling me I'm not a normal girl for not wearing these torture devices!!!
Eugene is the hottest ever and slays me in every video .. the dagger heels have me SNATCHED
Zach was super cute here??? He's always cute but those shoes really complemented his look in a way I didn't expect.
The shoes matched their personalities
I would wear Zach's heels beside not the other guys
its good enough that they did not put THE TRY GUYS on youtube red
I love these guys😍😂🙌🏽
I love the boots.
For some reason their legs look really skinny?!
EUGENE DROPPIN IT LIKE ITS HOOOOOOOTTT! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👅💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦 life.
What a day
Can the try guys try volleyball??
KIETH'S FIANCE!!!
Yay! I was afraid Try Guys was over! Glad to see more of you!
What type of jacket is Zach wearing?
I want Zack' s shoes
the only heels that I wear on a normal basis is 2 inch heel for Irish dance every week :P
zac is me at 5;37 with my friends
Am I the only one who saw that Eugene kiss Ned at 6:41
Ned and Eugene look so hot in heels.
What I'm I doing with my time
i fell off the bus stairs once because i was wearing heels and i didn't have the hands to grab onto the rails
How could Eugene choose anything other than something called Dagger Pumps
I can run, jump, dance, practically do anything in 3" or so heels, but any longer and I'll be like a flopping fish on the ground
I couldn't breath this is priceless
Men should wear heel! They're slaying it!
“someone bumped into me and stepped on my TOE” lmao
Leave it to eugene to pick 6 inch dagger pumps
Know the pain! I can run in heels and I don't have a problem. Might have sore feet later but it's fine then.
hahahahahah I love you guys
I hate taking my heals off.
Always thought Eugene was gay
oh god Eugene
Eugenes dancing is so beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍
When Eugene did that squat dance thing everyone was 😲😲😲😲😲😲
5:43-5:44 NED DROPS HIS WEAPON.😂
how do people think this is hard heels are easier to walk in then normal shoes
2:31- 2:32 Eugene DROPS HIS WEAPON 😂
There's Zach in boot heels...and Eugene in dagger pumps...I find that funny😂
Keith's toes look better than mine. Damn.
Zach at 1:00-1:01... DROP YOUR WEAPON.😂
2:00 Actual representation of me wearing heels and I'm a woman.
It isnt letting m with he yputube red thing
Welp that was a rolls royce, shoulda let em hit you 💵💵💵
Ankle boots are most comfortable
Ankle boots are like safer
Anyone else think Eugene is like totally gay
Those feet turned me on, wow
omg the try guys have to try stilleto nail acrylics
From the neck down Zach straight up looks like Harry Styles with those boots.
I would wear everyone of them shoes
I'm all for Zach embracing male heels, do it dude! you looked great
"I may have made a terrible mistake, but I look hot."  Every female to ever wears heels.
Eugene... Honey... I can't even watch you do this to yourself...
Omg mad respect to Eugene
Eugene looks hot in heels. I mean Eugene always looks hot but he looks amaaaazing in heels.
I think that Zachs heels were the most normal
Brendon urie should have been in this video
Eugene is tge sassiest omg
Love the try guys! 😁 this was do much fun, I personally don't use high heels because it makes r feel insecure, I'm almost 6' not trying to be taller!
I love the try guys 😹😹😹💜💜
UGIN YOU DON'T LIKE CHRISTMAS
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK. fandom were ya at
After my high school graduation, I couldn't feel a spot on the soles of my feet for a month and a half. For my University graduation, I wore flats.
okay i need eugenes shirt
ok if Eugene fell backwards and his foot went up he would take out an eye
"But I make these high heels work"
UGH. Zach. date me. 

That is all.
"I motherf*cker dance."
-Eugene 2017 
😂😂😂😂
My friend from school, he wears heels every Wednesday 😂
i hate buzzfeed but try guys are my guilty pleasure
Eugene scares me so much. Because my mom is a model and she can't even make it one night in those heel's.
Well, they should try gender switch next time
Keithe's fiancee is beautiful af o.o
Eugene is hot af
"My feet are on the dirty ground but I dont caaaare!" I've been there many times xD
Eugene : when I get told to dance . . .  I Dance 

😂😂😂
I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but I make these high heels work!
just one word. sasssssyyyy
V f
Omg one time me and my friend were walking around in four inches and she made me run the rest of the way home
oh god eugene chose the worst heels to wear lol
That guy who stepped on Ned was mean and he said "Welcome to the real world" and catcalled
Eugene is so tall but +6In!
Eugene is so weird in heels.
I hate heels but I like Zach how he chose Ankle Boots
IF i get 1k likes i Will do IT and upload to youtube!!!
Buzzfuck
Anyone else loved how serious Eugen was when he said"and I motherfuckin danced
Keith is me. "You're walking so slow!"
2:13

- so that's the kind of shoes Sebastian [black butler] wears? xD
Anyone else think Zack reminded them  of Andrew Lowe with his jeans and the boots
They make these high heels work
Try Guys should try Bollywood  Dancing!!!
Try pointe shoes 😂😂
my feet are sore just watching this
Zack just looks like he's in Harry Styles shoes for a night and tbh he can pull it off
"When I was challenged to dance , I'm motherfuckin danced"
eugene always looks hot no matter what he does.dammmit!
Y'all shoulda just worn stripper heels. You get the height, the pizzaz, and the comfort 😂
Eugene is usually the best
"Cat called"
"Where would I wear these? I wouldnt."
I'm a guy and I would try this
did they really go to a strip club?
Eugene can walk better in those stilettos than I can in regular shoes.
I hate heels and Im a woman
can try guys try nail extensions for a week and do day to day  challenges please :)
We're they at a gay but?
Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Zack!
I saw the girl stripping in the club XD
i wear zach style heels almost every day. i dont even count them as heels. theyre so comfortable
Eugene is a gift.
Keith must have an amazing wife if she paints Keith's toe-nails.
oh my god its so sexy
Zac longbottomed by 3 inches
What video do the Try Guys do drag in? They are brave, I'm a woman and I never wear heels. The closest I get is to wear cowboy boots that are 2 inches lol.
I am so happy that I can't wear highheels XD
Hey Zac, I'm a size 11 Those boots are cute, let me take them off your hands.
Removing your heels is sometimes better than sex
I think it's funny how the guy with the glasses (sorry I don't know his name) felt more confident wearing heels cause he looked taller, when I'm over here trying to get smaller cause I'm 5'9 or 175 cm tall and I'm 12 years old 😂
I would where the boots and the silver ones
*Starts playing don't threaten me with a good time*
i lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt
but i make these high heels work
네드 겁나 인실 당함ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
i felt like zach wore the boots on the wrong feet, aren't the zippers meant to be on the inside?
Zack definitely looked the best.
Bartender pulls away Ned's drinks
Bartender: No sir you can't have more, you're drunk.
Ned: No I'm not drunk, I fell down because of my heels!
Bartender:
Bartender: That's why you can't drink any more sir
Damn Eugene 😳
I need to know if some of my fave drag queens watch this show
I reckon they lost a bet to a man in a chiffon skirt, but they make these high heels WORK
😂 who grinding on my man omg.
I used to wear 6inch heels all day and then I would go home put on a different pair of 6inch heels and go dancing until a little after midnight and then drive home still in my heels. weak game boys weak game. though I do note that Eugen's heels do not fit they're to long there's a large gap between his heel and the show and after seeing his toes they're clearly not wide enough.
Ned looks fantastic.
Eugene is way to good at 'getting down'
Hey Try Guys you should try peyote cactus
I love this show
Idc Who's Wearing Them . As Long As You Know How To Walk In Them Lol
Haha! Guys wearing high heels?! How super duper GAY and UNMANLY!
Of course Eugene has to slay the day with 6 in stilettos
Here's a thought..

Don't wear heels
hahahaha. I'm 5'8". I'll never have to wear high heels. huehuehuehuehue
I would love to see them go out in drag for a night
I hate smaller heels so Eugene's stilettos are closest to the majority of my closet.
Eugene SLAYS MY LIFE. YES QUEEN
heels really ain't no joke like omg partying takes alot out of feet. I'm now just going in high heel sneakers instead it's better
Ned's tacos came with mashed potatoes.....
I hate how they say wearing heels is hard and it hurts after 3 hours try wearing pointe shoes for 3 minutes
is it just me or is Zac's receding hair line less... receded?
But like, where did Zack get his shoes?
My thought through the whole video

I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt but I make these high heels work-
Brendon Urie
How the hell did Keith score a hot babe?
I think the Try Guys need to leave BuzzFeed and make there own channel like Safiya Nygaard. These guys are the only reason that I sometimes watch buzzfeed but only because of them :)
Now I want to wear these heels thank you Eugene!
How Keith got his toenails painted 😂😂😂😂😂
Zacks heels are super cute
Isn't giving the name 'dagger' to a stiletto kind of redundant?
Ned, and his 2 entrees 😂😂
ya'll need to watch 1M dance studio's choreographer Bongyoung dancing wiggle in stilletos 😂
They should do the try guys try lacrosse, I'd like to see if they could even cradle the ball
I don't care what anyone says Eugene totally won Zack got off so easy
Hey, fellow men who were cursed with being short! There is something called 'Elevator shoes', which are basically platform shoes for men that are built to look like normal shoes. They make them for women too if you don't want to wear platforms or heels!
When you can run in heels and didn't know it was supposed to be hard
and what happened to eugene and ryan on the soffa?
None of them could walk in heels well to begin with! You have to swing your hips it makes it soooo much easier!!
Zach looks great
say what now lady*eugene* did you say m*********er
I'm a girl and I DON'T LIKE HEELS, like when it's a party or a fancy event.. I DONT WEAR IT, I wear something else that is elegant and cute.. and I DON'T CARE!!! IT HURTS!! and I won't stand hurt in every step I make just for looking nice... blah!! If you like me you will ask me to dance in my comfy shoes
Omfg Eugene looks so hot im sweating
"Six inches is a lot to ask of someone's feet" I am a dancer and I literally stand on 1 inch of platform and have all of my weight on 2 toes. You guys should try that. Try standing with your feet vertical. Not only stand but walk around and turn while looking perfectly graceful!
Zach's heels were probably ones I would actually wear :)
Not gonna lie Ned looks like he has Rickets or he pooped his pants and is trying to get to the toilet
WHY DOES EUGENE ALWAYS LOOK SO GOOD!? 😂😂😂😂
I'm pretty sure if Eugene wore a dress heels and a wig I wouldn't be able to tell if he's a boy or a girl
I wish I was a tall woman! I wear heels to make me look a bit taller! I'm 4'11, that is very small compared to normal women.  tall women make me jealous!
Eugene is so hot in this video. Would definetly let him grind on me if I met him in a bar. Maybe even pay him to do it. Yup. Would DEFINETLY pay him to do it.
Really really good solution to all of this women. Don't wear them lol.
I just take my shoes off before wearing flats😂
"The stilettos are so tall they'll motherf***ing kill you"

Eugene 2017
Eugene's sexy drop then that nice pull up tho ...gotta copy that asap😁😁😁😁😁 these guys are really cute ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤...odd moment 😶Keith has nice feet..pretty smooth 👣👣👣👣👀👀👀👀🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒
"The stiletto is so tall that they'll motherfucking kill you." 
-Eugene 2017
I feel like Zac got it SO EASY, that's what I wear as like casual booties/heels
But like when Eugene was dancing in those heels, he looked SUPER SEXY
This video would have been more interesting if they went to straight bars and not gay bars in weho where this isn't un common.
why are they called heels when you're on your toes?
Can we acknowledge that when he almost got hit by a car, it was a rolls Royce
they should have tried the men version, shoes with a high insole so from the outside people can't see that they're actually wearing some heels inside the shoes. it's popular in South Korea, because many shorter celebrities there use them (i'm a kpop and kdrama fanatic so i know these things)
😂😂😂😩😩😩😩
😏
The conclusion is that Eugene is a Stripper when wearing heels.





Same
I can't relate..my best friend literally wear heels everyday.
cool try guys are awesome , good job team
What shoes did Zach wear? I love ankle boots😍👌
Where can I get Zack's heels? Hahaha XD
eugene.
it's great when people can't straighten their legs in heels
Well, they certainly made those high heels work. wink, wink I'm watching you Brendon.
Eugene always goes harder than the rest of the guys
I haven't gotten my period yet but I imagine that it's worse than this
2:40 YAAAAASSSS SLAY Y'ALL SLAAAAAAAY
1:36 those are NOT stilletos, stilletos are nine inch tall monsters who often have an extra inch of heel under your toes, THOSE are little 3 inch tall heels I would wear to a grade school dance

2:14 THOSE are stilletos
The math one is so true
HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US
Eugene.
They probably made a bet with a guy in a chiffon skirt
#GIRLSTRUGGLES!!
at 6:42 there are at a strip club
Zach's doesn't count
Zachs outfit was on point
I freakin love Eugene
Funny how the boots look like normal hipster guy shoes
I'm sorry but Eugene's squat, bend and snap is what I live for now

edit: Eugene in general is now what I live for
so extra, so so extra


but I'm not complaining
"Sittin great" -Keith
where can i buy those boots zach was wearing?
Nothing is as great as when chunky heels and boots come in style at the same time. "Look! I can be sexy AND not break my neck!"
I can kinda walk easily in heels? not thin heels that's just..rip Eugene
but thicker ones like what Zach wore..that's where it's at.
Eugene was killing it with that girl
lol i can wear daggers but like i don't like how they look so i never do
Eugene is wearing the exact same heels that I have
I have the same "dagger heels" as Eugene. I've had to run, dance, and jump in them; it's probably one of the hardest things I've done in any theater production! I can't imagine spending more than two hours in them. :O
wait! HEELS HAVE NAMES!!
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT, ILL MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK- BRENDON BOYD URIE (Beebo)
Zach looked amazing
Zack looked so good in those heels :O
You guys are noobs I wear 6 inch heels for long periods of time and don't sit down and my feet ARE FINE and it doesn't even hurt. But still cool video!
i love Eugene he is me when i hit the dance floor
I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt


But I make these high heels work.
I may have made a mistake...
But I look hot.

- Eugene   😂😆😄
they are WORKING these
But weren't they drag queens before?
Ned is me - you have 2 entrees  I WAS HUNGRY
You Try Guys are so crazy wearing high heels, #giveitup Eugene! #Sohotbaby
eugene is just amazing as hell and hot af
zack is so funny :))
Laganja and Shangela YASsssss
I'm a sophomore in high school and wore about 4 inch heels from 7 am-11 pm. I can into school late and they were calling pictures for bowling so I sprinted to my locker and then to pictures in heels. I was limping by the end of the night. I ad to go to a college with my choir so that's why I was out so late 😂
OMG IS ZACH WEARING STEVE MADDEN CAUSE I HAVE THE EXACT SAME PAIR
I'm a 12 year old boy and I can walk in heels better than these people!
i think zach made the best decision on shoes, i think he wont get tired that fast
I always just say, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR HEELS. I am a teenage girl and I don't even own heels because it is unnecessary pain on my body.
"Who's that man walking down the street with those delicate feet? It's Zach!" Love it.
Zach honestly got the most comfortable shoes. CHEATER
Sachs should probably keep these and start wearing them
Zach is daddy
I wear ankle boots like that all winter and some of spring, they're really comfortable, nothing like stilettos
I just don't wear heels and hope men just start to get it when you don't want to be in pain. It looks good but flats feel good.
Zack looks the best in heels
Zach's heels look like they're just apart of his outfit😭
I love those ankle boots!!!
That feeling when you take them off
eugene is hott
Yes, their butts got better xD
Okay but whoever marries Eugene is the luckiest person in the world
Not only Eugene's shoes were lethal weapons, he was also wearing the wrong shoe number, so that sure added to the pain toll.
I legit think that Eugene could be the best stripper ever
Dammit cause Zach has smaller f***ing feet than me, I wear 12
I have three 8 inch high heels! My sister hates me because I can go through 6 hours with them!
ARIEL AND BECKY!!!!!!!❤❤
Eugene looks nice in those dagger pumps,his pants make him look like he has a girl booty in yoga pants. lol👅
I'm freaking 12 and I wear heels a day long
Kamna??? where you at?
I've watched this multiple times, and it doesnt get less funny 
this is hilarious
Knew Eugene would pull it out the bag with the stilettos
Of course Eugene had to chose the killer heels XDDD
NONE of the sidewalks are even!
but the high heels that they chose represent their personalities so well
If I were in Neds PositionRandom person steps on my footMe: OwwwwRandom guy: Welcome to the real worldI charge him in the backMe: Welcome to the real world
There is something wrong with Eugene 😂
Zach can get heels like that for men if he wants to be taller
After Ariana Grande finishes up her tour, you guys should do a video with her in which she teaches you guys her routines that she does in like 5in heels! She literally jumps around in those heels
The shoes are cute tho
Where can I get Zach's heels...
how is it possible for Eugene to be the manliest and girliest at the same time
Ned: "You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels"
Ned is definitely my spirit animal 😂😂😂
I love how they don't even question their masculinity.
That said, heels hurt every time you wear them. But I'm short and won't be taken seriously if I wear flats. The struggle, yo
I love Eugene so much
I needed a laugh today, thanks guys.
i ship them so much....
I just don't find heels to be anymore painful than other shoes. Ballet flats are the most painful thing in the world to wear. Horrible shoes, they hurt just to put on, let alone walk around in. I have tried on 20 pairs of flats and they all freaking hurt like hell.
but zacs heels are so easy to walk in 😂
Eugenes legs are the most sexiest i've ever seen XD
lmao the way they walk omg i cant 😂
the moment when he threw away the shoes, and then was like "lol no, just kidding, they costed money"
I like Zach's shoes the best
:o 02:32 Eugene !!  Not wanting to be mean but the ankle boots are the least, Eugene with those 6 inches was hot!!
But for real Zach picked the best and smartest choice. I would have only gone for those boot heels; maybe even a little shorter. 

Also totally understand the height struggle. When my friends are all taller than me and I look like a child but I don't want to destroy my feet.
8:01 That was not just a car! That was ROLLS ROYCE!
What a fabulous video.
2:33 sigh, why cant i look that good in ankle breaking heels
best advice for heels: walk as if you aren't wearing heels! keep your natural stride
I want those six inches... ;-;
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK!
What a bunch of benders ahahaha
I LOVE heels but you should definitely know which one to wear for a fancy dinner and which one  to wear for a night out 😂
Zachs ankle boots are lit, Id like to know where he got them from!
Me thinking I should wear heels for my birthday today and after this video nevermind
when the try guys wear better in heels than you... 😵😵😵
I loves those Daggers!!
zachs are only half an inch taller than mine but they're the same style
Eugene is crazy he wore 6 INCH HEELS for most of the night how even
when I try heels with different heights it's not that bad to walk I'm 13,and male and I know how to walk heels but Eugene was into it but he chose the very high one he made a mistake
Eugene would be the most extra with the heels
They all looked great in their heels but if you've never worn them for a long time before they are gonna be hell. Props to all of them for lasting as long as they did. Damn, Eugene... well done. And yes you looked hot AF but you couldn't pay me to wear 6 inch heels.
can you believe Eugene is 31????
i wish try guys, try some painful face masks
i just want to say- i wear heels bigger than everyone but eugene every day
i have a question.....why do most the girls wear heels if they hurt so bad?...btw im a girl XDD
Zachary had the go to comfy heel
dont do this to them please dont
Off topic: Have the try guys tried Finnish Sauna before?
High heals are NOT hot, Their just wrong!
All of you guys over here obsessing and thirsting over Eugene where as I'm thinking ned is really hot
Keith might turn into ned later..
Eugene is pushing himself sooo hard, OMG I'm crying...
like hi heel
if you like uegene like me



 subscribe!!
kuddos to u Huge-ne Ugene ;) even i am a girl n really feminine, i dont think i can pull off wear that all night long as u did.....hail up to u! ur ma n sisters should be proud x
The boots were the best option haha
Hands down to Eugene he's wearing extremely high heels which are too big for him.
"I'm just trying to get home without a broken ankle"- me everytime i wear heels
Watch out Ned and Ariel, cause Keith and Becky are hittin da town.
zach has it easy
Some of my friends have this ridiculous rule that they subscribe to which is if you wear the heels, you leave in the heels. I have LONG since given up with that because the only one who ends up suffering is you. I carry foldable flats in my bag and a set in my car and when I'm done, I'm done. I don't feel sexy AF when my feet are bleeding, the pads of my feet are throbbing, my arches hurt, or from the friction from walking 2 miles in them trying to get from the crap parking to a club. I wear them as long as I can and I feel comfortable and cute but then I tap out or I just wear lower heels to begin with if I know it's going to be a long walk situation.
dont you feel like their heels represent their personalities really well
!But I make these high heels work!
5:45 
Engine is officially the best person on earth. 😂😂😂
How did Eugene dance soo good in heels? Damn
"I almost got hit by a car... that was pretty chill" if that ain't me idk what tf is . 👏🏼😂
Ned is so cute❤He is my favourite❤
always trust Eugene to be fuckin' extra man.
I can feel the pain wearing Eugene's heels just by watching this video
Eugine is definitely the dramatic hot girl, she is always wearing the highest and sexiest shoes, lol. 

But seriously, taking your heels off after a long night out are better than an orgasm. Sorry guys.
I'm a size five with low arches.  AKA, anything above two and a half inches, and I'm tapping out (even though I'm under five feet tall).  The REAL secret is, wear wedges and thick-soled heels.  Sure, you aren't as sexy, but your feet also aren't committing suicide after a day of activity.
Zack is wearing Harry styles boots
I used to wear heels all the time but it started taking a toll on my feet, like even walking in slippers were uncomfortable. So I started switching to booties, then because of work and walking around for 12 hours I switched to tennis shoes and now I can't even wear a heel for more that a couple hours max. And only platforms with a big chunky heel. It's hard to get back in the high heel game after being out for so long.
They kind of picked heels according to their personality. Of course Eugene picks the dagger heels.
When I wear heels I try my damn best to stay in them from the moment I get in them until the end of the night when it's time to take them off. I just have a secret competition with all the other girls wearing heels, and I vow to keep them on longer than all of them 😂😩 it hurts really bad but so far I've always outlasted them. idk why I do it but it's fun to challenge myself even when I'm dying, my mom always asks how I do it. the only time I didn't survive was on New Years it was way too many hours and I just couldn't handle it 😂
my favourite part 3:28
I'm sorry, my thirst thought was bts Taehyung
It's 1:00 am and I started dying when Ned fell and I share a room with my sister it was so FREAKING HARD to try to keep it in😂💀
i wear a size 12... in mens..... im 15.... yeah try to find me shoes that i like.... i dare you....
My feet hurt just watching this video ugh man watching Eugene in those heels 😰 i liked Zach's heels and outfit the best! He looked so good!!
When you take heels off and put your foot back into the ground it feels like your whole foot melts into the ground
Goddam of course Eugene would get six inch dagger stilettos!!! And look fantastic. Way better than I would be in them.
MEN DO LOOK HOT UN HEELS!
junps into trash can to grab shoes
the ankle boots are the most comfortable
Okay, so where can I find a Eugene?
Oh ya Eugene si hot
I knew from just looking at the title that Eugene would rock it.
Zqck was the smart one to choose close toed, comfortable shoes
Next time they shouldn't be allowed to have the women there as back up
u guys are crazy
The dagger strikes 

when he flat out he dishonerd his famiry 
(not to be racist)
the way keith said toenails 1:13
in heels, they walk like chickens
Omg as a reminder you guys should stick one of the daggers in the wall as a trophy 🤣
ariel is so pretty
Zack, I think you are just the best!
"My feet are on the dirty ground but I don't care." EXACTLY! No more making fun of barefoot girls.😂
Damn Eugene, I would love to get a dance
I feel like I could survive in Zach's heels, but not the rest. Especially NOT in Eugene's heels.
Keith: "Aw you can only see four of my toes. Why did i paint all ten of my toes if you can only see 7"
Me: 4 plus 4 is 8 keith
😂😂😂
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY ZACH LOOKS SO FINE IN HIGH HEELS LIKE DAMN SON
DID KEITH SAY FIANCÉE
lol!!!!!😂😂😂😂 poor guy! at 5:28 when they step on his toe,sorry not sorry
What's the song in 4:20?
Kpop idols should introduce Buzzfeed men to the magical world of *insoles*, for short men.
i want that Eugene's Try Guys shirt!!
Next 
Try guys wear period pads for a week.
Ned and Eugene's asses were POPPIN ya heard? lol
I thought of me wearing high heels and then thought of riding my skateboard 

Yea nag brah I'm fine
THE ONLY SERIES WHERE THE PEOPLE HAVENT CHANGED!
woah eugene
They should do try guys do SFX makeup on themselves
The stripper tho 5:47 (far left)
It's so fitting that Zach wore the most comfortable and Eugene the tallest and most uncomfortable
Zach looks really good.
Eugenes heels are too big for him haha
once again zach was the smart one
I might be young but I know the pain most of my female family members had to go through while at a baby shower, banquet, wedding or christening, while wearing heels. I mean the whole banquet takes a crap ton of time. 6-8 hours tops.
the worst part is when you take them off for a bit then have to put them back on cause your feet had time to swell it hurts worse than before D:
Man, cosplay shoes are like this too. So much pain for fashion. >.<
Zach and Eugene...YEEEEEEES
they should try doing an escape room!! that would be amazing and highly entertaining 😂
I agree with Ariel
My college has a "walk a mile in her shoes" in which men would wear heels while the females would wear tennis shoes...this reminded me of that.
is it just me or is ned getting hotter like every video
i wore high heal boots to collage every day plus walking to smoking area 3 time the cafe 3 times and coffee bar plus walking to classes and walking home after I'd still have my boots on when I got home I'd take them off before bed best part were they had grip on the bottom of my shoes they worked grate in the snow and ice but when its snow and ice I pulled my mettle toecaps out
Dude I can't even stand up in heels for 5 seconds, and I'm a girl
Zack's heels don't count! They don't hurt, and you can walk easily in them. They're everyday shoes😒
Eugene haha
Panic! at the disco anyone?
Ned's wife looks like chapman from oitnb
Heels are actually very dangerous. They can improve the risk of ingrown toenails by a lot. Ingrown toenails are painful and terrible.
I would love to see try guys /learn to walk in heels/. They start with a kitten heel, go to a wedge, then a chunky heel, pump theeeen stilletos. Id love to see the guys try  walk run and  dance (especially Eugene) after they've learned how to wear them.
Hah I have shoes like Eugene's and women's size 5.5 feet.  Ballet training does have some uses
DANG they drunk a little two much God dang😂😂😂😂
Of course Eugene had to go all out
Keith face at  3:23 tho!😂😂😂
Of course Zach looks more cute then me in those boots
EUGENE I CANT LMAO HIS DANCING
Heels is hell on your feet!
As soon as I saw Eugenes choice of heels, I knew he was done for. 😂
what kind of batty man ting is this
Zach lasted the longest but Eugene was killing it! (Haha, it's a joke 'cuz they're dagger heels)
Zach's actually looked pretty good!
Paused at 5:06 it looks like it is an old colored movie
Jack was being smart personally I think the others where being kinda stupid🙃😐😐😐🙃
the try guys try to be smart for once! jk
Eugene is my spirit animal
You just know Eugene practiced wearing those before this video lol
Eugene... I'm crushed..
they actually look really good in the heels- especially zack
I love these guys!!!
Does Eugene have a girlfriend
They should do a try guys video of guys dancing in heels. Like Yanis Marshall!
My feet hurt just watching this
You did good Eugene ❤
"But I make these high heels work" - Brendon Urie aka "Fivehead" aka "Milk God"
I was watching this and all I could think was "Eugene would make a good frank n futer from Rocky Horror Picture show"
And now dance like the guys in Madonna's Girl Gone Wild....
I now have a new respect for women in heels
EUGENE ACTUALLY SLAYS MY LIFE MORE THAN EVER IN THIS VIDEO OMFG
zacs shoes are the only ones I was would ever wear
eugene is just from another planet I swear
I was fangirling so damn hard when Eugene was grinding and getting down low
Eugene is so extra I love it
Damn, that girl was all over Eugene
"I may have made a terrible mistake.... but I look hot" me every time I go out
Eugene be slayingg
Why do men have trouble wearing heels. We girls usually don't.
You know, high heels were originally for men. So, you could keep wearing them Zach.
Eugene has the most dangerous and Zach has the safes
ariel has a lovely smile and i see why Ned married her. their relationship is so cute. Sorry Ned i know you cant respond
I loved Zach's and Eugene's heels XDD And yeah, they're a pain but make my legs look incredible XD
lmao😂😂😂his dancin
where can I get the shirt with the names on?
'Not that wasted, jist wearing heels' MEE. Everytime I'm out and I trip people assume I'm super drunk, I'm just clumsy and it's hard to walk with heels on.
i would wear the shoes zack was wearinh
0:26 - 0:30 fun? well he's in for a suprise!
I was feeling so bad for eugene as i know the feeling ugh
Hell yeah Eugene. Hell yeah
Eugene , NO
yeah, more men should wear heels!
Someone should teach them how to walk in them. They would've slayed this whole thing and would have got to the bar quicker😂
Like, Eugene can fcking dance. 

Heels just make him hotter.
2:32 im gonna need about 10 continuous hours of this
All the shoes represent them
Heels. Ouch. Dagger heels. Kill the wearer and the attacker if used properly.
I may have made a terrible mistake... But I look hot.
-- Eugene, 2017
Didn't they do this already? 🤔
i feel bad for them especially the one w/ 6in TALL
I really hope they don't leave buzzfeed !!
6:19 I LOST IT
I wish I was that girl Eugene was dancing with
6:22 - 6:30 is it just me or did he sound like deadpool
Should've brought flats LOL
When you arrive to school 5:39
Okay low key the heels looked good on Zach
the music they used for Eugene has me crying bc it's meant for a funeral. Lmao
i actually like Zack's shoes. I NEED THEMM!!
Eugene is always so extra and I'm so here for it
*Sees Eugene in thumbnail*

He can do it. He can do everything
I love try guy's 😚
2:32 YAAAAASSSS
Okay coodles to all four of them especially Eugene for dancing like that in dagger heels. like i cant even walk in those so gg dude.
How does Eugene look sexy AF in EVERYTHING?!
He is probably as close to perfect as humanly possible.
Onision probably disliked this video
i have one of Zach's heels and they are simply the most pretty and comfortable things ever
"MAN DOWN! MAN DOWN!"
You mean lady down?
laughing alllll the way through. Eugene so extra, i love him
Zach's heels weren't bad. they were just booties
Eugene, 2 words- Marry me. 
(That dancing was amazing!!!!)
try guys become mermaids
Dude I feel like this all the time bc if my plantar fasciitis. Google it I'm to lazy
Eugiene, I'm so proud of you for lasting so long in those demons! :O It takes training to wear heels for a prolonged period of time, believe you me! XD And one of the best feelings in the world is if it's been raining, to take your shoes of, and step barefeet on that cold, wet asphalt, it's soooooo soothing... :O Just never take them off if you want to wear them again shortly after, 'cause your feet will swell.. xD
Shout out to whoevers home that is, it's gorgeous 😍
And boys, you did well!
eugene is such a G
i love how in any try guys video where eugene is being sexy almost every comment will be about that
Zach looks cute in those boots!
I'm half way thorough the video and suddenly I realise... I'm watching buzz feed. I'm watching buzz feed? WELL ITS ALL OVER FOR ME
HOW ARE ZACH AND EUGENE SINGLE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
it's upsetting that eugene is always killing it
Eugene and Keith are wearing our companies heels!! Yay!
Eugene's my favorite in those heels (and out) He's so gorgeous!
Keithhhhhh would you be a dear and lend me a shoulder
Give me wide based wedges and I could walk a mile
Not fair 😂😂😂 they should've all worn the same kind of heels!
I don't where heals but when kieth took of his I think it felt like when I take of my bra
They all look great in heels
I wore heals for a cosplay at a convention. They were low and quite chunky heals. I was dying. How do other girls do it!?!?
This video is just a bunch of grown drunk men In heels 😂😂why tf did I watch this
Is it me or Ned looks like Frodo?
.....a married Frodo, obviously :)
'You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels'😂
Gross
"Dinner is sitting. Sitting's great"
okay my gaydar is going off for eugene, how did i just notice it
Eugene is so extra, i love it
I went to a party at new years and everyone thought I was drunk because of my shoes
Wait...why was Eugene slightly than usual sexier in those stilettos? I'm so confused..
Big girl why you all in bare feet? Walking down that dirty city street
Keep your shoes on honey 'til you make that money, 'cause your toenails draggin' and it sure ain't funny.
"painted my t'nails" ..wat
Did they have consent to film in those strip clubs?
ok.....now it's time for a night out with wedges and platforms so u can compare them :)
Now these guys understand why girls would rather walk on the dirty streets with their heels in their hands then keep their shoes on.
zach actually looked good in his tho
I like Zach 😎
The try guys have never been so fckn fabulous.
Saw Eugene In Thumbnail
Click Immediately
I'd only ever wear the boots that zach has, stilettos are a no go 😹
Eugene I have heels like that and I'm literally 13 and can still wear them for 4 hours max
My feet on the dirty ground
but I don't care
my feet on the dirty ground
but I don't care

Sample that, pitch it down and you got the start of a Trap music track.
"Fun." You are SO funny Eugene.
Eugene had me laughing so hard.
So after that "guys walk a mile in high heels" video or whatever it was called, Buzzfeed recycles itself.
I liked Zach's booties :) those are some shoes I'd wear. All the others are a no go for me. To all people who are going to wear heels: you should practice before or you will bend your knees and look like a squatted t-rex in pain.
Next up on buzzfeed fake tan is black face
I would so wear Zachs heels because the other ones are just painful
I'm living for Keith's toenails. Also I love how he says toenails.
Yes you go Eugene!!!👠👠👠👠👠💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
this is a longer form of deja vu
BUT DOES IT MAKE MY BUTT LOOK GOOD?!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
am i the only one that thinks eugene got a size too large? o-o they looked a bit lose o:
EUGENE SLAYING AS ALWAYS
Eugene rocks those damn. He should wear them more often. More practical androgynous ones.
i love how comfortable Eugene is with his sexuality, but he confuses me sometimes
I wonder how many people saw Zach and thought he was just trying to make himself taller
i have 6.5 inch heels and they are murder. Eugene you did well
Well i guess this video clears up the debate whether Eugene is into girls..
It's fun to Dance in the floor-Ned
My favorite part about this is watching them all walk in them, it looks so unnatural and clunky haha I don't know what makes it possible to walk in heels effortlessly, but I just can?
Eugene is my bias. Can I say that?
do a other prank vid
.
I want Eugene 's shirt!!
I love try guys!!!!!:P
eugene has never been more bi than in this video
For god sakes, bring back Cayenne Pepper.  Like, bring back the drag personas just one more time.
Congratulations on destroying your feet!
Drunk me once tried really hard to leave my high heels on a shelf at a 24 hour grocery store because I was so mad at how sore my feet were. I just walked around bare foot until one of my less drunk friends realized what I had done, went and found my shoes, and made me wear them while in the store. Then I just walked home carrying them (the store was very close to my house). But I've also been on public transit barefoot before (bus, not cab) when my shoes broke on a night out. I am usually Zach on a night out now: never anything too high, ankle boots or wedges.
Omg any Army's here remember when V wore those heels and DANCED in them like he'd been living with them? Remember that miracle!? This video gave me flashbacks! Ahhhh memories... 🤤🤤☺️😊
3 inch boots? I wear them ALL DAY! What you do when you're 4'9"!
"Do you have any advice for us"
Ariel: "Don't"
Wait wait Kieth is getting married?
zach's outfit was super cute 😍
Eugene is me when i'm wearing heels lol
Eugene in stilettos omd.
WORK IT EUGENE

tbh i think guys in high heels are hot
Yaassss Eugene slaying all the haters, literally 😂
6:12.. Damn, Eugene.
My feet hurt just by watching this 😂👣
Didn't Eugene wore high heels before?
EUGENE IS SO HOT
Those boots aren't what I would call "high heels" There not hard to walk in AT ALL compared to the rest of the guys heels.
I'm pretty sure I have worn zacs entire outfit before now, the ankle boots, ripped jeans, khaki bomer
Goddamn Eugene!!!...you are fire!
SUBSCRIBE to become a millionaire at some point in your life
Are you sure you guys aren't just a little bit gay?
Oh editors of the video, you don't have to put Ariels title as "Ned's wife", we already know
Who else ships Kelsey Darragh and Eugene Lee Yang?
😂😂😂😂😂you made my day 
I love you guys 😍😍
There's no YouTube red in the uk.
they wear high heels better then me.. i remember one time i wear heels i fell .. doesn't make sense because i was just standing.. i have no idea how the hell did i fell ..
Zach you can buy boots like that for guys, the heel isn't as big so you won't be in pain but you still get to feel taller if you want and get that booty pop! Also guys, pro tip; gel inserts can save your life. Especially if you bring an extra pair and double up half way through the night
Ned looks so so so much better with longer hair. & I love how Keith is dressed.
As a person who wears four and a half inch heels every day of my life for any activity I really think they should have done this for a week. Start with kitten heels and low wedges, and work up to platforms and stilettos, then on their last day wearing them the guys wear the highest pair the got up to during the week and wear those for the entire night out. Also then the shoes would be broken in because that was a little dickish.
The try guys especially zack should TRY fish massage 😂
Zach and Eugene were so adorable together at the end, love how Zach was worrying, and he clearly made the smartest shoe choice - good man
Why were they allowed to film in a strip club
They should wear the thong, wear the bra, wear the clothes and then add the heels and go out for 4 to 5 hours dancing.
definitely won't happen to me, when I know I'm out partying, dancing and drinking, my converse serve the job just as well instead of killing me throughout the night! XD
Omg those dagger heels... Why are you doing that to yourself? WHY?
best buzzfeed video so far...
Eugenes are too big
Love how Ned just tosses his heels into the trash!!!!
Don't be a drag, just be a queen 👠
They all walked like a pregnant person in sims 3

They were all might fine in those shoes though
Omg
Let's face it I haven't watch the video yet but I know Eugene is gonna look the most fabulous on it and we love it
When your to tall to wear high heels cause guys are intimidated by you
BEST PART OF THE VIDEO 9:51
Of course Eugene has to win and be better than the rest... Like always!
The try guys for LIFE baby❤️
Why is Eugene so perfect like... why do Asian guys look the best in a group of guys... like no offence but goddammmmnnn
"Bar" goes to strip club haha yes!
okay but Zach actually looked good in those ? as in, some girls wish they could ? He should keep them to wear them again maybe once or twice just sayin
Eugene gotta booty
Good luck, men of the 21st century .
But one of the worst things to do is take heels and then put them back on. Always have flats
I wear heels on occasion. Longest was 9 hours with 7in heels. They had a platform but I did not have feeling in 3 toes for about a month. Like legit. So serious nerve damage is possible lol
neds hair looks real good here
These heels are tiny, try wearing the 8inch at least heels women normally wear, like Eugene.
i only watched 18 sec and i think they look already sexy in these heels DAMNN
I can't stop looking at that Tagine (Moroccan Pot) at the back in the beginning of this video 😀
Where can I get those heels Eugene had omg
I can't imagine six-inch heels. I wore 4 inch heels in San Francisco once and my toes on one foot actually started going numb the next morning. Never again.
Is it weird that the thumbnail turned me on??
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
gay AF
Why is Eugene all ways so hot it's so unfair
oh god the memories.... i would drink purely to numb my feet, because after 4hrs of dancing its like your foot bones are broken.
the types of friends (as family) is so clear in this vid
what heels is Zach wearing?
oh my godd ... Eugene.. thats ..wow.. like WOW...! is there anything this man can't do!!???😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Oh sorry KATIE is the best. MOFO'S NEVER lose katie. sorry. she's kinda a tryfi yoda. just saying
best try guys Freakin EVER!!!!
Next video idea. Eugene teaches the Try Guys to Club Dance.
I see eugine, I click.
Not wasted, just wearing heels- me 😂😂✌🏻
why does Eugene look amazing in everything. has me bent.
My feet are about 6 inches long. I do NOT wonna be in those heels.
I can party all night in my high heels but I don't think I'd have made it nearly as long as Eugene in those monstrosities, seriously well done on that one lol
Next up: the try guys try licking just the tip of another mans penis
Wore heels out this weekend. Literally pinched a nerve and lost sensation in three of my toes for three days. Still rocked it tho
Eugene looks better in heels than I ever will
Can I have a birthday shoutout 😀
Omg zack is so cute
I want that shirt Eugene is wearing
Eugene looks like your hot Asian mother on a girls night out...
well, high heels were originally invented for men so they could be trailer and more intimidating. zach should Rick those cute boots whenever he wants!
Every girls dream to dance with ugene
Lol the car that gets close to Zach is a Rolls Royce. I love America
Try Guys try.... 
INSTAGRAM MAKEUP!!!
Zack looks good for a boy in heels
HOW DID I MISS THIS VIDEO
Eugene is...just Eugene
"so when i was challenged to dance.....i motherfucking danced!"
"So when I was challenged to dance. . . I muthafuckin /danced/"

And yeah, yup. Yes, he did. Eugene muthafuckin D A N C E D
These men are seriously the best. Love watching them
geez! I freaking love Eugene!!!
Eugene
Stop
You're way too hot
Eugene would have felt a whole lot more comfortable in those heels if they had fit him right
" WHAT IS HAPPENING!!?? "
He haves Dagger on his feet!! And idk!!
So men look good in high heels nice!
People mock college age girls for wearing ugg boots a lot but theyre basically anti heals, the heal cure.
There's a lot of uneven terrain😂
This was posted on my birthday and I wore heels that day.
6:24-6:28 That girl is the luckiest  person in the world
"They pop on four extra inches! I can't compete with that!!" Yeah Zach, WE KNOW.
Their feet looks so beautiful! mine has black stuff permanently stuck on the center of each toe fingers.
Eugene I pray for your feet!!! 😂😂😂
I once had to wear six inch, pencil-thin heeled thigh high boots to advertise for a superhero costume for a shop at a convention and I gotta tell you, after standing for 8+ hours on concrete with only one break where I could actually sit--I was ready to hurt people! Like, me and this other girl were leaning on trashcans and posing on the floor because our ankles were swelling!
My fiancé painted my "tunails" 😂
Zach actually works the heel boots! He should invest!
Ned's jeans tho
Can the Try Guys just get their own channel? I don't want to get subscribed to buzzfeed video, but I do not get notified when Try Guys upload...
Sorry had to bring it up
KNEESLAPPER!
I have such sensitive feet I wouldn't even be able to walk from apartment to my car in those dagger heels. EVERY pair of heels I have every worn including booties and tiny kitten heels make my toes rub and bleed D:
Part of it is also anatomy, though. Because I have a really high arch,  I actually do very well for long periods in stack heel or block heel boots - they're my go-to for work/daily wear. The position of the heels doesn't bother me and the support of the heels balances things out so I don't stress my knees out too much. Stilettos or spikes in general are a nightmare, no matter what the hight, because my knees are just too unstable to compensate for them. So my anatomy means I can wear five inch stack heels on boots all day and be fine, but can't wear 1 inch kitten heels to walk across a room without chancing blowing out a knee. This explains the large number of stack and block heels in my closet.
I loved this a little too much!! They finally feel our pain!! I always "flat out" 🤣🤣
I don't know why I expected any less from Eugene
How was Zach even complaining like those are everyday type shoes lol
I swear Eugene could wear a fat suit with a fake beard and look sexy. 
JustAsianThings
And they expect girls to where heels
I really just despise high heels. I don't find them attractive on women, I find them inefficient and hilariously impractical. It is like putting on a clown costume to appear attractive... why?
Everything Eugene wears he looks good in.
Let's be honest.
Buzzfeed is cancer
In all honesty though, Zach looked really good in those heels. Sometimes seeing a guy in heels will make you look twice cause it's not something you see every day but, somehow those ankle boots didn't look out of place. They were also the most sensible heel.
wtf heels arent even hard to walk in. theyre painful yeah but its easier for me to walk in heels than sandls
Neither literally verbalized wheat all women Say internally when we take out heels off
I love how they all have the perma-bent knees walking in those
Flats all the way...
even the gogo dancers are wearing flats they know whats up
Of course Eugene picked the most sexy, most painful heels
So happy they got those shoes out!
WHY IS EUGENE GOOD AT EVERYTHING !!!!💕🎉😇
ankle boots are my favorite omg
Zach got the easy ines
Heels were made for men. Seriously, they were made for men when it was invented. I think I learned it from Buzzfeed.
Ok Ned's butt, tho
Eugene looks hot without heels or with..
Holy mother Mary of useless information...😂..Watching him walk around in those "toothpick" stilettos is hilarious!!!! I could tell by how far he was leaning back that he was trying to take the pressure off of the front of his feet. We women all know that lean...😂
They looked good in heels. Now I want a man that wears heels.
Zack chose cute heels. Why do the rest have such bad taste? Honestly zacks shoes were cute enough that a guy could pull them off. Maybe that's just me.
you know what screw hat guy who said "welcome to the real world" like cmon man don't be a Dickson
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT, BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK.          👠👢👡
Every girl ever has booties that look like Zach's.
Anyone who's ever worn heels. Felt the relief with Keith when he took those heels off!
OMG Keith's face when saying "sitting's great" totally reminds me of #LelePons 😂😆
This is just weird
OKAY NOW I'M SCARED. I have to wear heels all day for my cousin's wedding and there will not be that much seats. God help me.
"Where would I wear this, I wouldn't." Katie
eugene is so extra i love it
when I do wear heels, any bigger than 3 inches, i always aim for pumps. pumps make you taller but they're SO MUCH BETTER
lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt , but I make these high heels work
Why is Zach wearing the same outfit as me
Heels are no joke! lol I got married on Friday and literally took my heals off in the middle of the ceremony before my vows because they hurt so bad. I couldn't concentrate on what my husband was saying. I didn't put them back on again 😂😂😂
Of course Eugene doesn't like Christmas.
Eugene went all out on the dance floor
5:48 strippers?
You guys should do "The Try Guys have the best bachelor party for Keith's bachelor party"
I just sprained my ankle and I'm laughing so hard because right now I can't even get in tennis shoes XD
Next time do it in the boob weights
Try running in heels
Heels actually harm your feet
Congrats your destroying your feet.
You weren't cat-called, Ned. Don't make light of a very intimidating and frightening situation that women are often faced with.
this is the quality kind of content I watch the try guys for
3 inches are considered kitten heels now?  Geez, I'm old!
heels are really bad for your back so maybe dont
Nice DTMWAGT tribute. Sorry my bad English. (Edit? Never.)
zach's shoes were too easy in my opinion lmao i have practically those same shoes and i wear them to skill which is around 9 hours
Ned's me at dinner
the asian guy had the tallest heels and he didn't COMPLAIN as much as the others!!😒😒😒
zach voice oh my god Keith's getting got a fiancé
Eugene has his incredible leg muscles to thank for lasting that long is shoes like that. Anyone else wouldn't have made it for more than an hour.
but i make these high heels work
Eugene, the overachiever..... those things look dangerous as hell.
can i buy Zach's heels??😄
Wowww they wear heels better than me!!!
Omg Eugene I cantttt
Poor Eugene... his heels weren't the right size.  he was doomed to fail from the beginning. :(
Zach has some damn good fashion sense, I'd wear those heels. His are the only cute ones!
i want Zach's booties badly (":
I think Zach actually looked pretty nice with the heels..........
You should try high heels on calçada portuguesa (portuguese pavement)
Was I the only one who thought Zack was the most strategic? Because everyone else's choices made my feet hurt just looking at them.
Eugene Asian squatting the entire time 😂
i just realized that eugene's shirt said the try guys' names #SQUADGOALS
When you take your heels off after a night out: BEST. FEELING. EVER!!
It was upsetting that
1) I would wear zach's entire outfit
2) that EUGENE still looked hot af
3) They were all so cool about this entire thing I wanna give them a hug. All of them.
Zach should wear those boots more often. He looks pretty good
I really wanna have a husband like Ned.... He can be sexy, funny and serious at the same time.
Oml they were in a strip club 😂😂
why is eugene better than me at everything
the.... cringe.....
Ankle boots are comfy af
ok now try heels an entire high school day. thats eight hours. with stairs. 




H  U  N  T  Y
this is why I don't wear high heels.....mostly because they don't have my shoe size, but other than that, they are evil devices of Satan
Eugene looked so fine in those heels
That was a rolls Royce should have went ahead and got hit
I did this for a whole day and my feet not hurt
Let's take a minute to talk about how Eugene looks good in everything! Dedication.
love you guys
I see them complaining about Neds heels, when my mom wears Eugene's heels. Every. Single. Day.
Eugene should have wore Zack's heels,would have looked much better.
Hey, that t-shirt i sooooo cool! I dig it!
Winners of —
Best overall outfit: Zach. (The whole thing worked and was sexy af)
Toughin it out: Eugene. (Anyone else feel a masochistic streak there? Badass dance moves though)
Most effort: Keith (for gettin his t'nails all purdy)
Best butt: Ned. (Did we think it could look any better? No, but here's the proof!)
Why in the end Zach and Eugene were at a strip club.
I would wear Zach's heels or Keith's heels.
That a$$ tho
I'm a stripper... just imagine
ughh ned's butt is goals im jealous
Ned's butt looked amazing when he was playing pool! also the fitted button up and tight white pants were really working for him! he looked like a prince!
i want Zack to wear heels as a casual, he looks goo in them
did Eugene loose a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, cause he makes those high heels work
Ok but those shoes Eugene wore, I wouldn't even wear those... those are dangerous!!!!!
Is it just me or was Eugene lookin EXTRA good in this video?
is eugene gay?
6:43..is that a male stripper xd
👠👠👠 work them heels work em yasss Eugene 😂😂😂
some girl's : i looove high heels
me: hdkshsks i love Eugene hdkshsk
Props to eugene
Keith is becoming the new Ned with his new fiancé lol
You sissy that walk Eugene, you sissy that walk!
this doesn't count, they are basically females.
Damn I love Zach
Zach got it easy
Ned's butt tho.
I wish I was Eugene
Zach-"what do you think is going to happen? They're ***** daggers"
Me-it's also Eugene sooooooo
"The try guys move in together for a week" < that would be an amazing Video
Eugene was looking so fierce in those heels. I aspire to slay like him.
I would date Zack. anyone else?
i love eugene
They went to a strip club😂
Realist thing ever said
"When you drink it distracts you from the pain." 😂😂😂😂
eugene rocks his confidence like i could never wear those heels as a tall girl
Try Guys should invite men outside from the buzzfeed company to get different opinions ad views into videos. I feel like that would be so funny and different .
0:30. Zach, Zach, Zach...that's kind of the point
Eugene in a bra:Looking Good
Eugene in a diaper:Looking Good
Eugene bald:Looking Good
Eugene in Heels:Looking GOOODDD
C'mon.
Let's face it.
Eugene looks good in everything.
I love how when Eugene just puts on his heels he drops it😂😂😂
NED WHY DID YOU ROLL UP YOUR PANTS
you gotta walk one foot directly in front of the other. they are all clomping like kendal
Eugene should've opted for platform heels if he was gonna wear 6in heels. I've worn 5in heels with platform and I can last a bit longer in them than the 4inch no platform ankle booties I own.
Eugene be rocking those heels
Zack was Slaying the game with his boot heels
If your feet hurt, drink more. British logic :)
I see a lot of half naked male go go dancers.
I'm going to need Eugene to stop slaying my existence.
damn Eugene
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
Wearing heels is like a three hour calf workout
someone please make a gif out of 2:32
Eugene dance moves though
I feel like Zach had an unfair advantage with such sensible heels. I mean, I wear shoes like that to school and they don't hurt at all
I like zac
I know the Eugene looks good, but how have you guys over looked the fact that he doesn't like Christmas!!!
Eugene was the best
It's so easy to walk in heels though
neds wife: "dont"
they gave them the worse type of heels possible lol
I need Eugene's pumps oh my god
I want them to try the period pain simulator😂😂😂
I high-key wanna be that girl grinding on Eugene
Is Eugene gay?
heels are really bad for you feet, ankles, and back
Eugene gets gayer every video😂😂😂 I love him so much though
Ned's heels are actually kinda cute!
i think Zach looks taht cutest😘😘😘😘 love the jacket
ok if anyone can kill it in those heels ins eugene but it pissed me off that they didn't fitttt! Zach's shoes on the other hand were very cute and sensible.
Yas queen! Work them heels gurl!
OH MAN I LOVE EUGENE HE IS SO CUTE
Why are Eugene's so big?!? LOL... Guess that's so they don't hurt SO much.
I would have to guess that you guys have had a lot of experienct wearing high heels.
Eugene HAHAH him dancing is hilarious
These boots look actually pretty natural on Zach... Like, it's nice ! Why don't men wear these more often ?
I would like to see a compilation of every time Ned has said "I'm married" or "my wife."
Prince anyone?
OMFG I LOVE EUGENE'S HEELS I WANT A PAIR
eugene is by far one of the best people to exist
Why are there legs always bent
They need to teach them how to walk before these videos honestly.
6:21 oh you danced alright 😮😲😨
haha, I love you guys!
zach: wearing 3 inch heel boots
HAHAHA
THOSE ARENT LEGIT HEELS
I love when the try guys try feminine things and have a deeper appreciation for women and the standards they are held to
WHO'S THAT MAN WALKIN DOWN THE STREET WITH THOSE DELICATE FEET! ITS ZACK!
Are Eugene's heels the right size? They don't look it
If someone told them to walk heel to toe it'd be so much better, they just think they're supposed to walk like normal and that's why it's really difficult
eugene is a queen omg. i cant even walk without falling on my face.
Okay, but I really love Zach's heels, where are they from lol???
I'm kind of into Zach wearing heels
I love how the last bar is The Abbey
Eugene always does the hardest things like now he pick the highest heels
all the heels i wear is 6in heels and i can wear them up to 6 to 7hrs a day lol
Tbh, they all looked rad with heels.  I feel like Zach looked particularly good though.  Maybe because his shoes were the least like death traps?  Idk.
I want Zach's boots.... They look comfy af
I'm pleasantly surprised how well these heels match their outfits and personality! You go guys! 💕
I'm curious to know if Eugene and Zach are gay?
I've never found heels uncomfortable lmao
EUGENE DANCING IM SCREAMING
yassss eugene
Everybody talking about Eugene when Zach CLEARLY looked amazing in those shoes. Great outfit, great look, 10's across the board.
The try guys got to try to "hakken"
i would only wear ankle boots not dagger pumps
dammm eugene you look good in everthing rock them heels
Next video: walk around barefooted.
....ah..... KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS
asian squat lol
Eugene dancing... I'm so not okay.
am I the only one that gets rip-roaring foot cramps in the arch of my foot after wearing heels? taking them off and standing on the flat ground is super painful for a few minutes after wearing heels for awhile
2:31... YAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSS <3
Eugine is literally what I wanna be 😇
Yeah we get it they hurt... but they're the ones that put them on to ward off / impress other women, if you chose to be in pain then don't expect any comfort or understanding from me.
They all looked super hot wearing heels
Eugene, I LOVE YOU.
"so when i was challenged to dance..... i mothefucking danced" - eugene
eugene always goes over the top
Eugene is more feminine than I'll ever be
Heels are just awful. Feeling bad for fashion is where I draw the line.
Can we just admit that Eugene is a majestic unicorn that could make anything look awesome?
Hey! Welcome To Poses With Eugene!

Eugene: *step 1: Sit down

Eugene: *step 2: PUT ZOZE HEELS ON

Eugene: *step 3: Look At The CAMERAAAA!

Eugene: *step 4: GIVE THAT FACE

Eugene: *step 5: Get Up

Eugene: Do that pose

Eugene: *AND THERE IM SO GOOD A-

Holds On To Curtain
'they look pretty good on men's yup Brendon urie proved that
omg I love this. I would totally dance with Eugene or Zach. And Ned poppin that booty while playing pool 👍😂
Good job guys!!!
HAHAHAAHAHHA
i laffed so hard when they went to the strip club lmaooooooooo
Awww Keith and his fiance are so cute together
Zach's shoes: Ok I would wear those. Eugene's shoes: OH HECK NO!!!!!
I think we need a video where Eugene teaches us his favourite dance moves for winning dance battles~
wait...all their friends/wife conveniently had the same size shoe as them?
while women also have to walk NORMALLY when wearing heels
TWO OF HEARTS TWO HEARTS THAT BEAT AS ONE
I am with Zack I would kill myself probably less in the shoes he is in than the other shoes
Would it be weird to ask where they bought Zach's ankle boots?
Everyone looks hotter on heels!!!! I'm sure they secretly will wear heels again :)
Eugene was so incredibly hot that I could barely take it. And Zack was so damn cool too, he chose the right damn shoes!
I can't even last a hour in one inch heels
I have a huge crush on Eugene he's so adorable
when I was at the women's march in Los Angeles earlier this year, a guy was wearing red stilettos the entire day and had a sign saying "walk a mile in her shoes" and this reminded me of it!!
eugene always does the most
not drunk just wearing high heels kind of just the same thing I wanted to put that out there
This is finally the time

Will you leave me

Are you crazy no

Will you kiss me

When I have the time

Will you hit me

What are you thinking no

Do you love me

Yes

Darling

    ^

Now read it this way
Zach looked damned good in those heels though. And he said he liked it. He should just do it. <3
NED'S WIFE
This video was arousing.
"I may of made a terrible mistake, but I look hot" 😂
Eugene's shoe would have been a bit more comfortable if there was a platform at the toe. That's the only way I can wear super high heels all night.
"My heels for tonight are actually called dagger pumps, because the stiletto is so tall..*turns to camera*..they'll mother fuckin kill you"
eugene looks good in anything
LMFAO!!!!!
I would wear zach's
I wanna see the try guys tyring out gel/acrylicnails for A week
Lmao!! They lasted longer than me 😂
I know i'm not the only guy getting really uncomfortable watching this xD
why do zachs heels look so natural on him 😂
Eugene and Zach my faves. Eugene worked it but when I saw them heels I was like 'And at that moment we all knew he fucked up' 😂😂😂. Also Zach should take charge of his height and work it instead of taking his insecurities out on girls who wear heels. I don't care about the height of someone I'm dating just the heart. Lol corny but true 😂
It's my brithday today, the amount of likes determine my age.
Omg Eugene was getting DOWN dancing at the pool bar with that lady! Damn! 😱😋
6:27 girl you better get your hands of my man you look like you raided the sale section at wet seal with your wig
Those aren't kitten heels Keith is wearing. Kitten heels are 1 inch or lower. 3 inches is a pretty standard heel height!
Why did zach sit on the ground to put on his heels when there was a couch next to him
as i girl i can say i prefer wearing thick heals because thin ones are harder to walk in and hurt my feet more after wearing/walking around them for a while
I absolutely loved Eugene's dancing
i wore 4/5 inch heels for  like 6 and a half hours......i regret everything
Zach looked great
Eugene dancing with that girl slAYED me
I just realized that this is how I look like when I walk in heels.
That's why when I'm older I will take all  the questions and WEAR CONVERSE AT RESTAURANTS!
Try guys try vaginas!
How tall is Zach?
When i was about 4 years old i pretended to be a catwalk model, so i used my mom's heels and walked up and down the stairs, which made me good at walking with high heels lol
the best series on buzzfeed have Asians. Ladylike, Try guys, Worth it, Unsolved
why did eugene do that
eugene and that girl were really into that dance
Eugene is my spirit animal I loveee him
okay eugene wore heels with a fake pregnant stomach
As always Eugene is so extra xD
i like wearing heels 😊
can we all just take a moment to look at Eugenes shirt 😍
Am I the only one who doesn't find heels hard to wear?
Zach loved the confidence of being taller, he should just get those dudes platform shoes.
I dont anything taller than 3inch, i wanna be able to walk and dance when I'm old☺️😘
In my head, I think I'm Eugene in heels. 

But in reality, I'm Ned in heels.
YES EUGENE
Keith doesn't really say anything about his fiancée 

Ned says "my wife" in every video
The same thing that happened to Ned happened to me. My heel got caught in the rail and I fell so hard the bar tender cut me off.I wasn't even drunk yet.
I think Ned is wearing the most comfortable ones, Eugine is wearing the least comfortable
Eugene and his DANCING LMFAOO
I still have problems wearing heels...
so true!!!!
Zachs shoes suited him so well... might be because he was so confident about them, but hotdamn...
Eugene is so extra!😂
As usual, Eugene had to be a whole level of extra... its getting kinda annoying actually...
The shoes are expensive hahaha
I loved them all in heels, but my favorite was Zach. He wore something that I would wear and something that I would love seeing men wear more often (obviously they can wear whatever they want, but holy molly it looks good)
Eugene is me on every level  XD "so when I was challenged to dance ...I motherfuckin danced " heels and murder weapons . So don't cheat or you see a pair coming for your head
here's the thing if you're over weight those heels hurt a loooooooooot more
lol Eugene looked miserable. Can def relate. Zack had the best time, kinda looked like a rocker.
When you thought that Eugene couldn't get any hotter
They put on heels and their inner divas come out 😂
It's just not Ned's day. xD I know that pain of jerks stepping on your toes, even with closed shoes people pull that one on me!

Can I just say Eugene has a bit of an extra challenge because his heels are too big at the back part of the shoe? That makes things even more painful. If your heel is too big, the back kind of grinds against the back of your foot with every step you take. And don't underestimate the dagger heels. My mom is known for being able to walk AND run in any kind of heels, and I showed her a picture of dagger heels once. She went 'NOPE'.

I swear, the man survived an entire night in freakin' DAGGER HEELS, with added pain of the wrong size. Give Eugene a round of applause! ...And some bandaids, for pete's sake.
why is Eugene so hot tho
lmao
"nope not wasted ..just wearing heels" 👐
My mom has the same Ankle Boots.
I quit smoking 2 years ago. My son was born, and I wanted to be a happy Father that didn't have any addictions, especially to life threatening things. I haven't picked up a cigarette in 2 years, and I thought I would feel happy again. Now this video gave me cancer anyway...
Zachs heels are sooo cute to me.
I'm pretty sure I'm in loooooove with Eugene, watching him salying on those stilettos is almost making me blush. He's AMAZING
zack please wear heels every time you go out.
Keith`s face at 5:39 lol
"Welcome to the real world." 
Ned: "I was catcalled." lol
Eugene will forever be my favorite try guy bc he 'eugenifies' everything
Honestly, never a more true video was ever made. But those guys made those shoes WERK!
All men should do this for one night. Also, we need more sexy shoes that are not high heels.
You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels~Ned LMAO
at 5:25 they blur out the people's faces in the background but in 7:07... did anyone else notice that xD
Buzzfeed should make a compilation of every time Ned mentioned his wife; I would watch that
fuckin eugene goin hard
Eugene. is like a sexy girly anime guy, we all know guys from anime are all bi xD TOO HOOOTT
✨And of course Eugene look fabulous✨
I'm not new to Buzzfeed but I don't keep up with their videos. Can anyone help me to point who's who!?
The way they walked in the heels really triggered me XD
'Every inch of my being was screaming, "get out of these heels" ~Eugene 2k17
Eugene is so attractive. Stop existing
omg zach i have those ninja socks too <3
NEXT TRY GUYS TRY 4INCH PLATFORMS ❤❤❤❤❤
i want an episode of the crab try guys! #crabguys
Can tri guys do a collaboration with ladylike
YOU BETTER DANCE FOR YOUR LIFE!
LADY GAGA IS LITERALLY THE QUEEN OF HIGH HEELS! LIKE LOOK EM UP
ugh 
the girl that danced with Eugene..
i need to be her
Heels make you feel good, confident and utterly fantastic... for like an hour. After that all you want to do is murder somebody for the pain coming from your feet
I want Eugene's shirt! 😍
Watching this is so funny considering that my sister and I wore heels since we were like 4 or 6 years old. But props for them! They lasted longer than I expected.
I got to hand it to Eugene! I couldn't have survived an entire night in those heels and I wear heels quite often. :D
am i the only girl that can't even wear heels,  and doesnt like heels?
Eugene killed it ! HAHAHA
Sneakers all the way
block heel ankle boots are the wise choice, i can wear mine all day long without pain.
neds wife would get it
just pick a comfortable shoes ladies
I want zachs shoes they looked so comfy
Eugene gets more girls while wearing heels than anyone else I know, like damn can you please share your secrets with us? Shed us a little of light???
This is exactly how I feel about heels! I love them. They're so pretty but it hurts so much to wear them for longer than an hour.
beauty is pain
I feel like Eugene's just finding any excuse to wear heels, I mean come on, the drag video, this one, the motherhood video, etc....worst part is he rocks it better than any girl could.
next should be try guys try
  heal less shoes next
"and then he said 'welcome to the real world' ...OOHHHH!!" lmao
If they hurt so much, why would ANYONE wear them?!?!
Zack is the smartest , followed by kieth. The block heel and the kitten heel  would be easier to walk in than stilettos
Bruh I can go for a jog in all the heels they where wearing 😂
Eugene with the daggers YASS THEM MOVES QUEEN
is it just me or is Ned getting hotter and hotter?
Why is Eugene sexy in everything?
YES
I bring flats with me so that I can keep partying
"I might have done a mistake..but I look damn hot" that is why we war those spiky bastards on our legs anyway :D Tell me girls who can actually FEEL the feeling when they took off their HH and put on the flats?:D
90% of comments are of Eugene... I AM NAT SURPRISED HE IS SUCH A GOD! 😂 all of the guys are better at wearing heels than me... I am soo embarrassed of maself 😂
EUGANE IS MY SPRIT ANIMAL
9:51 👏👏👏
Ned has a good butt
trust eugene
Zach was wearing the easiest ones! I could run a mile in those and I dont even walk that well in heels
This is hilarious and made my night
"any advice for us?"
". . .don't"
Me too Ariel. ME. TOO.
Am I the only one who wants to have those boots !!!
Yep Eugene's a bottom
i love how the moment fashion comes in to any try guys video, Eugene just becomes the God of looking good
i cannot wear heals, they hurt my feet
Ned looks so good in these pants
I don't wear heels, but the ones that zach had on look cute and not too bad.. maybe I'll buy a pair.
Eugene actually looks amazing
Eugene's heels are obviously hade for a drag queen.
I wish I was that girl Eugene danced on that's a dream come true
"You got f*cking two entrees?"
"I was hungry!"
------------------------------------------
"No one can tell me what to eat in heels."
------------------------------------------
God Eugene you can step on me all you want
Keith has a fiancé? I didnt know hat 😅
I like Zack's the most. It actually suits him.
Eugene is such a g
Omg I want the Keith & Ned & Zack & Eugene shirt
omg!! love it so funny
Everyone except Eugene copped out. A 3 inch heel? An ankle boot? I mean most chicks don't wear stipper heels every weekend, but come on, those were probably the easiest choices.....
This is why I bring flats or flip flops in my purse!
6:10 gurrrl you got some moves 😂😂😂😂
I really liked Zack's heels 😂
Poor Ned
Of course Eugene could make a 6 inch heel look FABULOUS!!
I loooove Zach ankle boot...ITS PRETTYYY
I'm Ned in heels.
So silly! Eugene rocked it!
I thought keith was single!!!!!
Eugene looks so much hotter in heels than any other girls
zack looks real good in dos heals
Rip Eugenes feet
5:14 walking up to my social life be like
This is what happens to men when they vote for Hillary.
the thumbnail..what women would actually look like if we stop shaving every other day....
tbh zach looked hot in those heels he should get a pair for himself no joke
eugene can still walk in 6 inch heels better than me ffs
Eugene is fukin insane-
I wonder if this is how Ariana Grande feels. She's always in 6 inch heels lol
Ned can I have yo booty
eugene looks as hot as usual
Women complain about high heels but fun fact, you don't have to wear them.
Zach's heels are actually cute like can y'all tell us what brand it is?
I wore heels while dancing last weekend and I just got the feeling in my toes back today
better than expected
I LOVE ZACH'S BOOTS. HELL YEAH!
but daaamn that dance between eugene and the girl tho
I don’t understand how everyone says, “Yeah, they’re torture and bad for your feet, but damn, they make you look hot!” When I see someone in heels, I get creeped out. I know I’m not the only man on earth who is turned off by heels, but it sure feels like it.
Ariel looks so pretty!!!
Aaaand Eugene is killing it as usual
i wish guys would wear heels more often they look so good. especially zach.
I love u Eugene 😂😂😍😍😍
Why? Why is it popular to wear shoes that make you bleed and warp your feet? I refuse to wear heels nope
"i go outside, i stand by a dumpster, and i take off my heels"

love it haha
Eugene's "too much gene" is showing XD
bruno mars should watch this
2 to 3 bars a night? we don't even have that many bars in one town without driving half an hour
5:13 zach is just having the time of his life lmao
I'm so happy for Zach in this! He realised his most confident self and rocked it!
The try guys are so amazing! I love you guys the most of everything from buzzfeed! U totally made my day, I had an awful day and this made me smile🙂
Eugene got 100 times hotter in heels 🍸

I just learned something about myself today. Cis male with normal personalities? Boring. Metrosexual cis male that gives off a gender fluid vibe or can pull off queer fashion? Perfect.
I'm 10 and I can run in heels
Ned's hair looks fuckin great
My friends dared me to wear only heels to school for a week. I had to borrow my sisters heels, and gym class never felt better because I was forced to wear sneakers. I now can run, dance, and fight people in heels due to the dare.
okay so when i wear heels i literally only last from home to the bus station and im done with the heels...and those are literally 3 minutes..so respect to these men !!!!
And just like that Eugene came out the closet
Zachs shoes look amazing tho I want them
"He just said welcome to the real world..ohhhhhh"lmaoo
ahhh, i would love to see these fuckers wear pointe shoes xD
Ned in heels is like a woman on her period.
Honestly I feel like the worst part is when you get home and take them off. The throbbing, achy heel is death
It's not like buzzfeed has uploaded at least 3 videos about this already...
Isnt this repeated?
Eugene is my true spirit animal
Eugene just looks hot no matter what
This was incredible, God bless you guys 💕
I feel like Zach is rocking those ankle boots... Zach, you should get some men's heeled boots! Seriously!
I feel like Ned is secretly gay
Zack looked amazing! I want his outfit
these boots are made for walkin' 😏
I will never wear stilettos I'd constantly be thinking I'd break them
im crushing on Eugene but i dont think i could keep up with him hahaha
Bruh I'm 15 and I'm wearing those same 3 inch booties that Zach is wearing
the blonde girl looks a bit like vilde
get any blisters lol
work it Eugene
Benefits of being a tomboy-
No heels for me bitch!🙅
Zachs shoes are my choice for going out usually because theyre so comfortable and also look good
when Ned can be both a wife and a husband material
cute dog
damn Eugene you look good
why these guys' legs are more sexier than mine? ㅠㅜ
it's alr incredible that they don't get blisters behind their feet from new heels. O.o
That moment when guys look better than you in heels...seriously,  I walk like a newborn giraffe in those
Eugene is fierce af
Eugene is queen.
they should do a date night edition where they would wear heels tight dresses bras and put make up one
I love Eugene energy, he work every challenge until  he owns it
"I'm just trying to get home without a broken ankle"
the struggle is REAL
SO HOT
Now you know what society put us, women, through. Doesn't help that so many  women are so eager to put themselves through hours of pain and risk years of feet & back issues just to fit in or look good
eugene i cannot hahaha
They made these high heels work
I want to marry Zack! bring him to me! <3
Wearing heels and going between places = URBAN HIKING
i would rather were the ankle boot heels
It's really hard to wear high heels even you haven't wear it yet but to choose one pair of them.
Ah maaaan I love you guys so much :)
i laugh so hard to eugene hahhaha
They should've put on some more fabulous clothes for this experience!
"not wasted, just wearing heels" LITERALLY MY LIFE
'I may have made a terrible mistake... but I look hot'
 DAMN YES, YOU LOOK HOT AS HELL. EVEN MORE HOT THAN LEO VALDEZ
"Dinner is sitting and sitting is great "  basically my life
The hardest part is cheating: when you're sitting and easing off the heels for a moment of relief and then you have to stuff the blisters and blood back into the heels and walk again.
Eugene nailed it
Eugene is SOO attractive!! And when I saw him wearing these high sexy heels I was like OMFG!!!
Am I the only one thinking about Eugene's shirt?
ned is so hot, how am i noticing this just now
Zacks shoes are the only ones that I would consider. they would be so easy to walk in.
Eugene should totally wear heels some more
tbh their choice of heels rly did them in

save urselves... wedges are always an option
man down... lmao
No sh*t, guys. What did you think would happen? Good-ness.
Zack looked good lmao
I miss chianne pepper.....
Zack is the only one who showed heels I would actually wear out lol
Zack is so cute 😍
Zach actually really suited those heels also they were super cute
Zach's booties are the perfect shoes for using gel insoles. Extra padding makes more less pain. Oh & yes eventually heels cause foot damage over time. I donated most of my heels last year. I bought padded flat leather like shoes for $70. I wear them almost daily.
lol just wear platforms or chunky heals its so much easier
that feeling you get when you take of your heels and it feels like your feet are melting into the ground. Like somehow you are now a part of the floor.
"You can only see 4 of my toes"- Keith 

"Why do I have to paint al ten of my toe if you can only see like seven"- also Keith 

4+4=8
I s2g Zack is so cute
And as per usual Eugene out does everyone😂😂
Eugene looked effing HOT. Also, I loved all the shoes. And Zach and I wear the same size. I'm glad you got the shoes out of the dumpster because I was sad you'd thrown them away!
I totally think each of their choices of heels suited them really well :)
zack looks so cute
STOP PRESSURING ME TO GET YOUTUBE RED BUZZFEED I WONT DO IT
Yass Eugene ur so confident
Try guys wear bikinis on the beach
Try guys gone blonde for a week
Try guys start a band
Try guys become try girls
Try guys try naked oil wrestling
Try guys wear skirts
and many moree......
When you're a stripper and Eugene has better moves that you...
Should've got hit by that Rolls Royce's
I wore 11 cm heels at my gratuation & I'm usually already 175 cm tall... It was great though and I didn't even fall over:>
I wear heels often so I LOVED seeing these guys struggle in 3-6 inch heels. I can run in stilettos and I honestly found this to be hilarious.
ZACH LOOKS SO CUTE BUT HONESTLY I CANT EVEN WALK PROPERLY WITH AN INCH TALL SHOES. I'D SLIP MISERABLY ALL THE TIME.
Ned: What advice do you have for us?
Ariel: Don't 

😂😂😂
Eugene's heels are what I wear on pretty much a daily basis, I find them comfy
That moment when they walk better in heels then you do
this makes me feel better as the only girl in any girl squad that has to bring flats with her.
damn. eugene and zach should get themselves a girlfriend
I need Eugene's t-shirt.
But why the f would you torture yourself like that? 😂
How can men in old time wear this?
I'm tall, so I don't get to wear high heels. Yay. If I wore 6 inch heels, I would be 6'9, can you imagine a 6'9 girl walking around. I would scare small children, children, teenagers, adult men and women, and all of my friends because they're all 5'6 and under. Plus I'm scared of heights, ironic, isn't it??
I fuckin love you guys!!! 🖤
The amount of BOOTY in this video is highly appreciated
Mad respect guys!!!
Only Zack and Eugene 's heels looked good tbh
you could kill a man with eugene's heels
I LOVE THEM ALL BUT ESPECIALLY HIM
is it just me or Keith's feet are very neat and not manly at all HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAa.. he has a beautiful feet :)
No matter what we all have to agree Eugene won
2:14 to 2:20 Lol I love him
the try guys should o a thing were they llike where a full women outfit so like thos boob things and a bra and dress and makeup and there hair done for the same timeline as this:)
Heels were made by the devil, don't do that to your feet ladies
when I actually used to wear heels I'd take flats with me and switch to those between bars and when i was done with wearing them. it was very common to see me all dolled up in a nice dress dancing my arse off with flipflops on
WORK IT EUGENE! -2:30
That girl who danced on Eugene was legen-wait for it- DARY. LEGENDARY.
i still don't understand how women are able to walk
Zack was cheating and didn't even know it. Thick heels are mostly very comfortable, it's not nearly as harshly painful as thin long heels.
"Not wasted, just wearing heels"
Love the Try Guys!
I really ship Zach and Eugene ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
wow zach isnt the same quiet and shy guy anymore 😂😂
i  thought Eugene was kind of creepy that drunk :s his like ´´;))`` face when he danced w the girl :|
I love how eugene goes all out when it comes to smthing utterly uncomfortable
I love these guys
Zach's shoes looked sooooo good omg. Does anyone know where to get those, I genuinly want to know?
Oh come on zach gets a free ride with ankle boots
I love Eugene's shoes... where can I buy them?
image if man high heel was still a thing now
i can run in heels when im drunk.
2:31
Of course they'd choose those heels.

Zach wants the most stability.
Keith wants to show off all of himself. (Not in a snobbish way, don't worry. :P)
Ned would want to wear something his wife might.
Eugene wants to make himself the motherf***in' boss by giving himself the most torture.

The gist of it.
I always ways find it weird when people say heels are really high and impractical, but then I remember I dance on the tips of my toes with wooden pointe shoes.
"I look hot" no, you just look gay
Zach's shoes looked great to be honest. They suited him. Could be men's boots. shrug /Also all of their butts looked great. Ha.
I Wear HIGH HEELS Every Day & I Wear Flats Every Day. I Love Wearing Women's Shoes
4:20 when you spot GEORGE CLOONEY!
Hard to write every good quote from the video because every Try Guy is awesome!
becky is so pretty
Poor ariana grande, she does full performances in heels that big or bigger..
I've always wanted to stab someone with a stiletto just to test out its sharpness.
eugene grinding in heels made me feel some TYPE OF WAY
when eugene was dancing OOH BOIIIIII
I say Eugene looks good in everything, but when he walked he looked like a baby giraffe that's drunk off its mind
Zac
Thumbs up if keith and ned are couple goals
I'm only thought when they started putting on the shoes and walking, "I can barely stand in that shite and they can practically jog in them." I feel low key insulted. LMAO
"You got heels, that toosh has got the push"
Keith
For anyone that wants to wear heels like this and is not used to it, do it slowly. You're using completely different areas of your legs, butt and back to get around.
women do realize high heels aren't mandatory by law yes?
I'm seeing a trend of Eugene going the extra mile and hurting himself in the process..
Eugene!!!!!!
Poor Zach at the beginning. Hating how women make him look shorter. 😂Zach you are amazing even if you are not as tall as everyone else
2/700th comment
also eugene is so inspiring
zach is so sweet in this video tho
0_0 it really did bleed! I thought he was being sarcastic!
Neds wife looks exactly like Vilde from Skam 😲
omg I literally made that same bar crawl one night, every bar the same lol
Try doing pointe work. Then you'll cry
Eugene has daggers and is like sexy
Zach was the only one whose heels went with his outfit. I could see him wearing those more often!
When Eugene inner drag queen come out and he still look sexy
yey!!! I finally met becky!!! Im so curious about her when I watched the worth it house episode!
I want Zacs outfit!
Dude the ankle boots are the most comfortable
Eugene was like the Asian brendon urie
My feet hurt just watching this...
I'm trying to find the boots in the dumpster.
I need those six inch heels ❤ anyone know where they are from?!
Each pair of heels fits their personalities and outfits so well I love it
I would love to be taller. If you're tall you can wear flats all the time and look stunning. When you're short nobody notices you. I've never understood tall girls crying they can't wear heels because they would be taller then the guys. Well, you're still the ones they are noticing.
Zach is literally the smartest one out since he chose the ankle boot and not SIX INCH STILETTOS
EUGENE THO
if I was one of them I would be Zack. I love those shoes!
"I may have made a horrible mistake...but I look hot."
 -Eugene 2017
RIP Ned.
I could have sworn they already uploaded the exact same video with like the same lines months ago.. Im going insane, I need a nap.
those shoes just perfectly describe each of their personalities lol
"Pop that booty!! When you got heels, that tush has got the push." LMFAO
zak looks hotttttt why is he single
"they are lady gaga"
Eugene gets even hotter and even gayer every video I love him 😂😂
The heels describe them as people😂
Should have forced them to the "Date Night" menu. No bloating pizza for you Salad only!!! Can't have your pooch popping out of that LBD 😂😂😂
I may have made a mistake, but I look hot- Eugene 2017 quote of the year 😂
i just turned 13 can i get 13 likes :)
Ned is looking  soo good ❤❤
is eugene gay?
Zachs werent even proper heels
Of freaking course Eugene would wear the most difficult heels and smash it right out the park.

I swear they put  me to shame, I just look like I' trying to put up an awful circus balancing act in heels.
Mad cred guys
Eugene's would've felt a little more comfortable if it was the right size lol
i love how Eugene always goes the hardest
Zach look hot 😂😂
I love how they're all walking like satyrs 😂😂
Zack looked fabulous and pulled them off
The shoes Eugene wore look like the ones from the movie single white female that are used to stab someone on the eye.
I did not think Eugene could get any hotter uM
I wear heels to be tall because I'm only like 5 foot without them😂
i cant belive they threw the shoes in the bin wtf
I'm not drunk, I'm just wearing heels!
Is zac wearing an Adele T shirt  cause I brought one the same at her concert recently ❤
Lucky girl though.
Everything Zach said about competing with females in heels, YES. Even though I'm a said female myself (and don't face the same pressure to be tall like males do), I'm even shorter and can't compete even if I were to wear the highest heel. I truly feel like a little hobbit in a tall forest everytime I go to some function where there are loads of females in heels. It's frustrating and hurts my neck.  I usually don't wear heels as I value comfort and stability. 
So #PermanentArmpitSnifferforLife . Oh well.
zach looked so cool!!
I don't understand heels at all. They're impractical and they literally destroy your feet. Seriously, look at the high heels page on Wikipedia; people have been known to lose toes. And what if you suddenly have to run because you're being attacked or are in an emergency situation, you have to ditch them. What's wrong with a nice pair of flats or sneakers? Why can't people look or feel attractive while also comfortable at the same time? I don't get it.
I am very curious what that last bar that zach and eugene were at xD
When taking off heels after a long night...it is easily comparable to an orgasm
I watched and couldn't relate because I'm pretty much in heels always... all kinds. Six inch stilettos included. And the women saying they time themselves... I felt weird because that's pretty odd. I just pick a shoe. I wouldn't carry another pair unless I was altering the outfit for a different event
Yass Eugene yass
Eugene is so fabulous
That awkward moment when you've been to the same bars they're at 😂
ned is so pretty
takes off heels
orgasms
Eugene is my dream man
i would absolutely wear zachs entire outfit it was cute as hell
"My fiance, Becky, painted my tuh-nails"
Did anyone else think that the heels Zach wore looked really nice on him??
I have MAD respect for anyone that can run and/or dance in heels. I cannot wrap my mind around that one bit.
Zach definitely got the easiest shoes
Zach and Eugene looked amazing :0
WHEN NED THREW THE SHOES INTO THE DUMPSTER
Zach is super cute
Heals are not that bad if you know how to walk in them... heal to toe just like normal. If you walk on your tippies it's gonna hurt. Nothing worse than watching women walk like wounded animals.
We all knew eugene was going to love this
Ned was like every drunk girl during girls night
Something is telling me Eugene has danced in heels before behing closed doors😳
Eugene...gay.....looks hot being gay.....and he is a better dancer then me
eugene is so motherfuckin extra

and i love him for it
Dude they did this as drag queens
I never thought i'd see a stripper that wasn't Eugene in a BuzzFeed video.
Zach actually looked cute with the ankle boots
Zacks is the best
I love the try guys!!!
I'm only two minutes into this video, but I think this gonna be the one time Eugene doesn't win at something.
jealous of that girl dancing with Eugene.. am I the only one
I really don't like Eugene. He's too cocky and too obnoxious. Sorry fans.
I'm a size 12 in mens how did they find heels that fit them omg someone tell me where to find heels I want some like Ned's
YALL WAIT KEITH HAS NICE FEET THO IM SHOOK OMFG
Sorry for stepping on your toes man.
"They get taller, and I get shorter." Most relatable video with  your guys' significant comments 😭😭💀
Does wearing heels automatically make people want to drop it and twerk? Seems like they really liked doing that lel
Keith has super cute toes though.
4:47 great shirt Eugene
Before wearing high school:Pffftt,This is going to be easy,At the same time it'll fabulous on me.
After wearing high heels: internal screams from hell(high heels)
"When you drink it distracts you from the pain"....tell me about it..
I started wearing heels like Eugene's in middle school, in my family heels under 4 inches are unheard of. And Zach's heels totally don't count.
Awhhh Keith's engaged! Congrats!
Damn Eugene, get it!
"Who's that man walking down the street with those delicate feet     its ZACH!" LMAO 👍😹😂😅😆
"So when I was challenged to dance...I motherfuckin' danced."

Yassss! Eugene knows! No matter the pain or what else, that's the rule! 

P.S.
Getting your exposed toe stepped on is THE WORST!
Eugene is savage.
i on't even call ned's shoes high heels
If 2:33 isn't your favorite part 😂
Zack boots tho. Maybe he would love those elevator shoes that Tom Cruise supposedly wear all the time
Zack looked so hot oml
I don't understand why women wear heels. Inconvenient and, doesn't do anything but make you walk awkwardly.
I like how Eugene and Zach are hanging out more, Probably because Eugene and Ned are now aware they're the alphas.
I feel like if Eugene's heels weren't massively oversized he would have been able to walk a lot better lol
I'm so glad you made this video
"I may have made a horrible mistake. But I look hot"

Me using makeup.
Try guys do the athletics
OK but Zach's actually looked really good with his outfit??? Like if that was a silver zipper it would be perf
when i was little my older sister was in high school and all she her heels were like 6 inches high so i thought that was the height of basically all high heels. fortunately now i know that's far from the truth, but at least i can walk in them if i want to😂
but the shoes seem to encapsulate their personalities
I was watching the strippers in the back of the last bar 😝
I'm not even gay and I'd smash Eugene.
Eugene is an inspiration!!
The booties in this video!!! Eugene and Ned!!! So amazing. Now you know the power of heels for the booty.
Zach actually looked damn good in his ankle boots
eugene is insane. 6 inch heels all night?! he lasted longer than i ever would. the guy with the booties is a genius.
I put on my stilettos to watch this
I hate it when Eugene wears those and survives. I still slip even in sneakers lol
All i want is for eugene to step on me with those heels
All that crouching and leaning against surfaces, smh. Women wouldn't do that, no matter how high the pain levels are. And flating out is not an option either, one got to suffer at least till one is safely inside an uber.
Zach should wear ankle boots more often, he looked good! 😂
WHERE DID THEY GET SHOES THAT BIG? I have a giant foot I need to know ☹️ No woman's shoes feet me (I'm girl)
There is no way Eugene isn't gay
the 4,000th video
That's why i use my cute sneakers and stay at the club until 6am
if i'm going out, i ain't going home before the sun rises
The heels Zach wore looked sooo cute omg !! ( P.S i'm not a heel fanatic but i really liked those heels Zach wore)
I would pay to see all of Eugene's Dancing holy goddamn
That girl that danced with Eugene was lucky as hell
i mean zack
neds are the most comftorbale
I only wear the height of Eugene's nothing smaller maybe taller
Eugene=DADDY AF
😂 Rock like you mean it / love it / own it  😂
This is why I love Eugene. He just goes all out.
its hard to compete with 4 additional inches
Fabulous
Ok. But I want Zach's boots.
😂😂😂😂😂
I haven't laughed so hard in a while!!!!😂😂😂😂
Zach was the smartest one of the bunch. Too bad nobody chose wedges.
8:07 that was a damn strip club
EUGENE
6:42 was that a strip club?😂
Kim taehyung aka V even danced in heals in Star King lol
Eugene, you always go to the extreme! I'm surprised you lasted as long as you did in 6 inches!
how come they can walk in heels but i can't.
Honestly Zach looked so good, like that entire outfit was top notch
Becky and Ariel appreciation  post for supporting their try guys
Eugene. Always making me have a "I'm not gay, but..." thought.
eugene looked so good oh my god
this video was gay
Eugene is always so extra...
I love it.
Of course Eugene is all Go Big Or Go Home 😅
"I don't even care if I don't have flip flops!"
* throws heels in the dumpster * 
"we should grab those shoes tho they were expensive"
oui get it eugene😂😂💍💗
I love how Becky, Katie and Ariel are just chilling on the couch drinking what looks like rose
Eugene is too good when it's about female things. Sorry for all the 14- year old Eugene fans, but he is more of a she...
I have a Keith butt but I want a Ned butt
Your are on heels and do Asian squad lol
Zack actually walks the best, but Eugene looks the hottest. 
Zack I 💜 you
i want eugene tshirt!!!!
Ned turns me on so badly
Zach looks SO GOOD! I think he should wear those more often
Eugene was killing it in them heels on the dance floor.
Yaaaasss queen, slay!!
How is Zack struggling
Why does most of every try guys video's thumbnail show only Eugene in it? 
Shouldn't the other members get a chance too? Everybody needs to calm down about Eugene being the most dashing one among the 4. Zach, Keith and Ned also deserves to be in the thumbnail. They are pretty cool too.
This might be a small issue but hey it's called The try "GUYS" not try Eugene.
Eugene looks hot af
Eugene has dagger heels cause he slays all our hearts❤️😂😂
This is the gayest that I have seen of Eugene.
Sees video title: "Ehhh maybe not"

See Eugene slaying: "HELL YEAH. CLICKS SCREEN A MILLION TIMES."
i swear, Buzzfeed should release a compilation of Ned's butt.  lol
I knew Zach would last the longest because his heels were the most sensible. Seriously proud of Eugene for lasting that long in this six inch monstrosities though
the best feeling in the world is taking your heels off after a couple hours and running around on a cool floor
Zack killed it tho
Zach and Eugene low-key looked pretty good in them
Zach really suits those, damn
I'm 6'7'', and I'm not attractive. Women approach me all the time. I think it's a primal instinct of the female genome to attract to the dominant (Tall) male. Just like men are most attracted to short girls with large breasts and asses. Life is regulated by science.
I'd wear every bit of Zach's outfit
Damn Zack looked good in thosw
"I'm just trying to get home without a broken ankle."- The Ultimate Goal
I did drag on Halloween and wore heels. I had to take them off after not even an hour of taking my little cousins trick or treating. Idk how people do it
The assessment is holding out, Ned and Eugene still taking it up a notch.
i loved Zacks little song at the start
Ugh the "Welcome to the real world" guy. >:|
ariel can't even compete with ned,
Eugene plays too much omfg
Eugene 6ft tall with 6 inch heels Omg
I feel so uncomfortable not because it's men wearing heels but because those clothes DON'T go with those heels
I love Eugenes shirt, where can I buy one?
😖😖
02:32-02:33 EUGEEEEEN... THAT DEEP AND RISE IS SOOOO HOT!!!
Omg Keith's engaged OMG I'm so happy aide I love Keith
NED♡
Friend: What does extra mean?
Me: Shows clips of Eugene
No heels for me.
yasssss😍😍
damn eugene
God, that lucky girl dance with Eugene on a really sexually way.
Zach got the easiest heels to wear!!
Did anybody notice the random booty in the air at 8:10 💀😭😂
How does Eugene and Zac not have a girlfriend??? Like honestly I would date Zac
I met Eugene yesterday!!! My friends and i saw him at little tokyo and it was the best moment of my lifeeeeeeeeeee.
He almost got hit by a rolls Royce...I would have stood there
Trust Eugene to pick out the highest, most sexy and literally impossible heels to spend the night in.
IS THIS BAD THIS IS KINDA TURNING ME ON?!?😅😂😂😂
I see Eugene I click
bahahaha THIS IS GREAT! I'VE AGED OUT OF STILETTOS!
Eugene is so extra omg ❤️
I last about 30 minutes In heels before I'm in total agony. I don't have tall heels Most of them are about 1 inch but with ankle and knee problems added too that plus the fact that I need a lot of Arch support I just can't Wear them long. I'm a teen and I'm already falling apart XD
Next video:




$5 dollar heels vs $90,000 heels
Is Eugene gay or straight no judgmental just curious
I would wear zachs heals
Six inch heels...Eugene walked in the club like nobody's business
"I think I made a terrible mistake....but I look hot."
                                            -Eugene 2017
"welcome to the real world, oohhhh" sexiest voice ever
Try guys Work out in heels
You should do try guys cross dress for a day
Here's a tip for any girl who wants to be able to wear their heels for long periods of time. Tape your pointer and middle toe together, it will take a couple times of doing this for you to get use to it.
Fun fact though, men wore heels before women. It was regular fashion for the upper crust of the 1700's. All you're doing is calling back to those times. Good on you, guys.
They're asses looked amazing. Especially Ned.
Eugene's and Ned's legs look amazing 👌👌
a 9 minute video?

WE ARE NOT WORTHY
FAT HEELS PEOPLE. The only way to last the night
Zach did it best imo, but Eugene was a force to be reckoned with, especially with his dancing! Like daaaayum he's got skill.
YAY FOR NON BINARY FASHION
AND THEN EUGENE DID A DROP OMG IM DYING YOU GO GUYS AWESOME VID
Three inches is not high heel. At least four inches honey.
I LOVED ZACKS SHOES right❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When Zach did the drop omg cmu
Ned and Eugene have incredible legs!!!!
im 4'10 and so i guess it's easier to wear heels. cause i don't have the same problems that the girls are describing. like... at all. idk i'm just so comfortable in heels
Zach's boots are the only ones I could wear. I tried ones like Eugene's and couldn't make it out of my house.
Died laughing at Eugene doing in the Asian squat for comfort, at the end. My brotha.
Zach was the only smart one when choosing heels. Plus he picked a cute pair.
Leave it to Eugene to pick the hardest pair
I literally went jogging in six or seven inch heels once for a dare. I'm superwoman.
got to give Eugene props tho, he lasted longer in those ankle breakers than I would.
GO FROGS! 4:25 🐸💜
There all cute and funny in there own way
Ned's booty tho
Eugene, why are you wearing fetish heels, lol! They're not meant for casual wear, but for show.
Leave it to Eugene to go all out😂
Keith polish his toes nail????
Is Eugene wearing a Try guys T-shirt? XD
zach's liTTLE SONG ABOUT HIS FEET I CAN'T-
6:23 Lolol Eugene
ZACK IS TOTALLY DRESSED LIKE HARRY STYLES
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
Clock Stacey Q playing in the bar
Round 3 i was lmao
But I Make These High Heels Work🎵🎵
I wanna know where Zach got his ankle booties!! They were so cute with his outfit!!!
tip for all you women out there: the farther the heel from the toe, the more comfortable the shoe
I love wearing the heels that ned wore, there the most comfortable to me and I can go a night without much pain in them. & you guys should do like a race in high heels, either running or with bikes 😂
I hate heels
I want Zack's heels...
"that's a lady gaga" GET THAT PROMO KWEENNN
i think eugene is gay
Zachs ankle boots look hella cute with his out fit. Also funny enough i wore keiths heels to my middle school graduation xD
This is why I love Eugene.
I love you guys, but how was the message of this video "yeah, women aren't lying." Yeah DUH, women are not babies, men are not "tougher" than women. "My wife has a timer for a reason" . . . again, Of COURSE SHE DOES. You guys don't think so little of women... right? Maybe instead of a trite conclusion about women's justified pain in these shoes, question the social expectations women face and why they subject their bodies to so much pain to meet others (and their own) unnatural standard.
the only thoughts I had the entire video are "I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt,
But I make these high heels work" and "I'm so gay for Eugene rn"
I loved Zach's shoes xD
Lol of course Eugene has to be extra!
Eugene and Zac look so hot
I want Zachs shoes
Out of all of the heals I really liked Zachs most of all🙂 Eugenes were just way to tall
Zach's shoes are probs what I would wear if i had to be fancy
The only type of heels I wear are Zachs and that's only cause I'm only 4'11 and need the height lol, otherwise I hate heels nobody needs blisters. Wore them to a wedding once, never again.
Lmao I can run in heels.
anybody else think zach is the cutest thing ever?❤️
three inch heels? I wear those nearly every day to my classes
Eugene always kills me XD
"Sitting is great" my man :V
They walk Bette run heels than I ever could😂especially Eugene
Zach has it easiest, i always wear shose like that.
Brendon Urie would be proud.
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT BUT I MAKE THIS HIGH HEELS WORK
I saw Eugene and I clicked
"I may have made a terrible mistake, but I'm hot! "
-Eugene
but i make these high heels work
How did I know Eugene would wear 6 inch heels
Eugene looks fiiiiine as always
SOMEONE PLEASE GET EUGENE ONTO RUPAULS DRAG RACE HES A QUEEN
Why do people wear high heels?
Legs in the thumbnail disgusting.  I know you are a dude but please shave
Honestly Eugene looks hot in anything. If he wore a trash bag he'd still be hot af
Ok but Keith's fiancé is gorgeous
Eugene is basically the jungkook of the try guys
I can relate to that last cut.
EUGENE HIT THAT DROP IN THE BEGINNING THO
I'm saying this before watching the video and I got click baited because I saw Eugene in the thumbnail. I'm going to have full confidence that he's going to rock this challenge cause I've seen the man dance in high heels to a Beyoncé song.
They looked so damn good in heels
You guys should try the preheels thing, i'm like really curious about it working
of course Eugene's gonna go with the dagger heels. My man is a better woman than I am...than I will ever be.
didnt they already do this
6:23 Hot damn! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Eugene.... oh my god.... I don't think I have ever laughed so hard😂😂
eugene is actually my goals in life
V should be there...
Eugene in a bra:Looking Good
Eugene in a diaper:Looking Good
Eugene bald:Looking Good
Eugene in Heels:Looking GOOODDD
C'mon.
Let's face it.
Eugene looks good in everything.
I call them ankle breakers
i actually love heels so I was giggling the whole time LOL
Ned zack and kieth are all like three inches, four inches, and then Eugene comes out and is like sIX INCHES BABY
But you know...pointe shoes...
Ariel is an amazing woman
i wore 4 inch heel boots everyday my junior year of high school. i love heels but they are so painful
zach shoes is literally not that hard to catch on, eugene thou...
cant even walk 1minutes with that !!
I like Keith less and less. After being a jerk on Worth It... I actually feel more like he's laughing at people than with them. :/
SINCE WHEN WAS KEITH ENGAGED?
Zach looks hottter with them heels on
That Asian human is definitely gay
GO Eugene
In the beginning of the video when Eugene showed his heels, I was like "I've worn shoes like that and he's gonna wanna kill himself by the end of the night" and then he proved me right towards the end of the vid🙂😂
I....mother fuckin' danced!
What's the point of wearing high heels if they hurt?
Can someone please explain to me why people hate buzzfeed so much
2:33 LOL
Zach and Keith have it the easiest
Zach actually pulled of a look in those heels!
I was walking in the dark with a phone flashlight and I usually can see and I was also watching the vid and I saw Ned like being "man down" and I saw him take a step so I took a step and that's not where the actually step on where I was walking was and then I like tripped but I was laughing at Ned so much but then I was also laughing at myself falling so yea that just happened
3 gays Cucked
Zach is so hotttt
Honestly, Zach looked really good in those boots!
Zacks song after he puts on his heels was hilarious 😂
I love how each shoe represented the wearer.

 Eugene was dramatic and fierce.
 Zach was sensible.
 Keith was not too out there but still had a bit of flare.
 Ned was Ariel...10 years ago...
Find the difference:

Welcome to being a woman
damn Eugene is so good
Wearing an face mask and watching this isn't a good idea😂
society doesnt let men wear heels but it was men who started wearing heels before women back in like the 1500s 1600s i think one of those but its true look it up origin of high heels
Eugene: Lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt. But I make these high heels work!
HE SETS A TIMER OMG I CANT
How does Eugene look like a fricking god in everything?
"who's that man walking down the street with those delicate feet it's zach" 😂😂😂
This is what I subscribed to buzzfeed for
"So when I was challenged to dance......I motha fuckin danced" - Eugene 2K17
Eugene dancing in heels is the best thing ever, he looks so damn good
I'm a girl and I wouldn't last 2 minutes in 6 inch heels so YASSSS YOU GO EUGENE!!!
Eugene just come out!!!!!!
OMG I HAVE THAT NAIL POLISH ITS BY REVLON AND IT CALLED MIDNIGHT
tbh zach should really consider keeping those shoes cuz he looked really great just sayin

and of course eugene looked sexy af like duh but those heels were unreasonable XD
I loved this video so much, laughed so hard. I love the try guys
Zach looks amazing tbh
Zach looked really good...
MOTHERFUCKING EUGENE.
"I may have made a terrible mistake...but I look hot." 
poses awkwardly while trying not to fall

Same Eugene, same.
Soon video: the try guys turn into burnt toast
I wore 6 in stilettos for my All Hallows' Eve costume and had them on all school day and walked 5 miles in them to trick or treat in the historic district in my town...they are not bad. well not THAT bad.
Zachs boots look high key good on him
yeah, screw heels lol
Super jealous of Eugene, but not mad
It's understandable😌
But I make this high heels work
I want Zach's shoes.
Zach's shoes looked pretty alright for comfort.
And to think there was a time when guys wearing heels was normal
OMG a ladylike video, worth it video, and now a try guys video! I love sundays now!
How'd Eugene get a girl to dance with him and I can't even get a text back
Ned those aren't stilettos XD
The fact that their wives/fiances/lady friends were there made it that much better.
I admire their courage
i hate high hells
How is Zach single? I'm so confused
I can FEEL the pain they're in oml I sympathize so much, this is why I haven't worn heels in two years✌🏼
Tbh I think Zach pulled them off the best like if u agree😂👌🏻
Someone should have told them to walk heel to toe because that helps stabilize you. And when you are walking down stairs you lay one foot as flat as possible and then follow with your other foot. Not the side thing they were trying to do.
Ned's face when he says 'stepped on my toe' I'M DYINGGGGGG
Why is Eugene so hot!!
Eugene is hot.  That is all.
Zach Was Thee Smartest For Picking Those Heels They Are Wayy More Comfy
Eugene posture with those heels look like Him from the powerpuff girls im hollering
"Who's that man
walkin' down the street
with those delicate feet
it's Zach"
Boy are you running out of ideas
Me when I'm wearing my pointe shoes :)))
I will suggest this again, and probably more after this. You guys should totally try designing runway clothing and runway walking ( which is much simpler... You could do both in one episode).
They're better than me wearing those lol! How do people wear these on the daily like how?!
Oh god my heart just broke when they were throwing their heels on the dumpster!
At 2:32, Eugene looks better than all of us
Great now Ik that they look better in heels than I do 😂
Zach nailed it 👍👍
Most to least practical:
Most: Zach
Next: Keith 
Next: Ned 
Least: Eugene
I wore 5-6 inch heels on my prom night from 5 pm to 11pm and didn't not take them off untill I got home lol
Eugene dancing in six inch heels is my religion now
"I may have made a terrible mistake..."

silence

"...but I look hot..."
funniest thing.. heels were invented by men.
Ok, NGL... Kornfeld can rock the heeled bootie better than I can.
zach looks great on that boots actually
If I wear heels I wear shoes like the daggers
I'm a ballet dancer, I dance en pointe 
Go big or stay home, in used to the pain!!
I wear sneakers when I go out lol
poor eugene! but if any one of them could pull off the six inch stilettos it was always gonna be him.
ZAC HAD THE MOTHER F*****   COMFORTABLE HEELS IN THE VIDEO LIKE WTH
Before the video even started I just had a feeling they were going to give Eugene the highest heels
At 6:09 Eugene is drunk and is walking perfectly in heals. Lmao. He's strutting
Haha
If Eugene was Queer he would be the litist of lit, forget flamboyant he would be a Flaming-Masc.
omg eugene slays everything 😭😭
Who ran out of ideas? Buzzfeed. How much good series do they have? 1 and what series is it? Worth it.
Zach is the only one who did this right. Good job.
The try guys should try cut throat kitchen or chopped
Eugene is literally everything to me
Dancing Eugene is my favourite Eugene
I actually like heels, except everyone hates me wearing them because I'm already almost 6' foot 😂
8:05 That's not a bar, that's a strip club.
gay
watches this
remembers that I spent an entire day in heels just yesterday
remembers im 15
cries bc of the relatable of this video
Eugene looks so majestic
Oh, Keith's is Engaged? I never knew!
wtf is eugene wearing
Eugene should replace saf in ladylike because he's a better woman then all of us
I remember requesting the try guys to wear high heels in office for a week but this is good too! Thank youuuuuu! 😂
Eugene is a better dancer than I will ever be 😂
PATA SUCIAAAAA
oh my god those ankle boots were everything
Omg i love Eugene. he kills every challenge. When he got dancing omg it was so funny
Zach had the easy shoes ever
...The more I watch Try Guys videos, the bigger my crush on Ned gets. Seriously, Ariel, I'm happy for you.
Eugene's heels remind me of HIM from The Powerpuff Girls
that male stripper at 5:47
I saw Ariel and I said its Ned's wife she's so pretty.
is part of 0.0001% of females that loves heels
Only 3 inches?! Gtfo my face with that
My fiancé painted my tunaels
I honestly hope Eugene got that girls number bc they were such goals even if they were both wasted
Eugene wearing those muh-thuh f*ckin stilettos made my day lol
Am I the only person who noticed the car the almost ran Zach over was a Rolls-Royce?
i think we can all agree Eugene is a little gay 😂😘
🤣🤣 I LOVE EUGENE!!!!!
I wish this video featured Brendon Urie, he would make the try guys look like cavemen walking in stilts.
Eugene slays anything no matter what he is wearing
But I make these high heels work
Now they look ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!!
I aspire to someday be as magnificent in heals as Eugene.
Eugene makes me rethink if I'm really a women smh
the boots ones are easy to walk in
I am pretty sure that there's a video where Eugene DANCES with stilettos on???
Eugene killing the heels game💯
God damn Id be sitting down drinking all night lol
Eugene looks good in fuckin everything
I love this 🤣 so sassy
I have Zach's ankles boots and they are INCREDIBLY comfortable. I wear them all day without a problem. Zack got really easy heels to wear.
Who else can like run in high heels I know I can anything over 4in I'm done for though.
There pinky toes will be screwed up
Lets be honest it wasn't the heels that made Eugene look even sexier its how he executed it with so much confidence.
Almost every single comment is about Eugene 😂
Ariel looks beautiful when she smiles :)
can I have zack' s shoes? we are the same size. i'm legit.
When Eugene dropped it I was like YAAAAAAASSSSS
try guys, can you try on weird runaway heels?
Zach actually looks really good, he should wear high heel boots all the time
Eugene heel look so hot!!!!
High heels were originally invented for men. Butchers would wear them to avoid stepping in blood. Women began to wear them to look more masculine so men decided to stop wearing them to avoid looking feminine. The more you know.
Why do girls wear heels so much if they universally agree that it's painful?
Eugene WOULD pick the hardest shoe to walk in hahahaha
6:20 is my favourite moment! He is so intense. lol.
Zack is such a cutie
I rather wear zack's lol tbh. Look for comfy
my dad walked behind me as Eugene was getting down with that girl and he was like "what on earth are you watching i do not understand the internet"
lol ppl think their all trans
try guys try to plan a wedding
They should try pointe shoes
Dude i dont know y but I want zach's heels so bad
Eugene you are hot no matter what!
Where do we find men like this!😂 lord they are so fun and cute
Do not read my name I beg you
confession: ive worn stilettos to school more than once
Eugene's and Zach's shoes, though 😍
I have those exact Journee booties Zach wore!
why do men seem to often work like velociraprors when they wear heels. XD
The try guys should do a week of women's beauty. Every day doing make up and hair, possibly shaving, night routines, etc.
YASSSS
I kind of envy girls who can wear heels. I have flat feet, meaning that even running shoes without proper arch support can really hurt after a while. Last time I tried to wear heels to an event, I gave up half way to the bus stop and went barefoot the entire day lol
Man everyone lookin fine
"But I make these high heels work" 😂😂😂
The secret to wearing heels without murdering your feet: get shoes. that don't hurt your feet. Surprise! They do exist. I have several pairs. They can be high.
...but I make these high heels work
Eugene is so hot
I'm a rather tall girl and wearing heels just makes me cranky and in pain. I'm tall enough so I like to be comfy/sexy and wear either heeled boots at most, or flats. I would not want to go home simply because my feet hurt.
every pair of shoes fit their personality 😂
Zach is the definition of adorable.
When Eugene dropped it like it's hot. OMG! Talk about slaying especially in six inch stilettos that are way too big for him.  Best video ever!!!
Me before Eugene puts on the heels: EUGENE NOOO!
Me after Eugene puts on heels: Eugene yes!!!
anyone else enjoy eugene as much as I did? lol
damn Eugene, rocking those daggers better than models.
Eugene's thot drop gave me life
Zach looked really good in his heel boots. He should keep wearing them.
this is why you carry fold-up  flats in your purse
Eugene rocks everything
Wait did that guy purposely step on Ned's foot tho? Wowww....
Keith's feet though. 💅🏻
Zack had the best shoes on, glad someone had a block heal rather than stiletto, feel sorry for Ed and Keith with toeless heals (instant blister maker).
Taking off heals is the best feeling
Y'all were at a strip club you can see a guy in his literal underwear at one part
Eugene killed those heels!!!!!
i almost never go out dancing or use heels.. let me tell u my little secret.. if you are going out use combat boots xD thats it. more confortable and your feet will be happy with you
zach should keep wearing those boots
queers.
Zacs books are actually quite comfortable.. I could wear mine all day!
my feet hurt watching this
Wait no hate but I thought Keith was gay...
Zack looks cute!
Zach honestly looked so hott
When someone asks how extra you are. Answer: Eugene.
Of coursed he liked it. He had the most comfortable possible pair of shoes. Wide heel enclosed boots. He sort of cheated.
There are few things as satisfying as making it through the whole night with heels and taking them off in the comfort of your own home
Honestly wedges are the best kinds of "heels." You have support and height.
MY SKIN IS CLEAR. MY CROPS ARE THRIVING. MY GRADES ARE UP. I HAVE 20/20 VISION I HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH EUGENE IN HEELS
Of course Eugene to hard core
"My fiance painted my t'nails"
Why are they using my legs for the thumbnail???
I love wearing platform stilettos, all of my heels are platform stilettos, the shortest pain I own are 5.5 inches and the tallest are 7
Eugene: And when I danced I mother fu** dance
Me: omg 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Zach looks so good in those boots though. I love ankle boots. They're the only heels I can handle other than wedges and wedge sandals.
And this is why we love Eugene
Eugene always take an extra step idk why!!
of course they have Eugene on the thumbnail next to heels
Eugene be dropping low like it's nothing ....damn boy chill 😍
I had to ask myself. Why am I still subscribed to this channel..
Zach looks so good in his heels
Zach shoes are like the ones that harry styles wears so they're kinda unisex
Hold on the try guys aren't the producers of try guys? They have Katy? I always thought they produced their own videos
LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT! BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK😂😂
Omg. Eugene at 7:48 though. He's in distress, but dang, it's gotta be a crime to look that good.
Eugene just went HELL YEA when he danced with that girl! I loved it! he always does extra.
Zach's shoes aren't fair because they would be so comfortable.
6:43-strip club
They went to a strip club
I own the shoes zach is wearing
The worst is when you find a good place to take off your shoes because of the pain but when you finally have to leave and put them back on, you want to cry!
I'm 5'0 and I HATE heels because I walk like an idiot in them but this video makes me want to wear heels... what kind of sorcery is this?
Zachs outfit was AMAZING
I cringed when Ned and Keith were walking barefoot in the alley. I have puked behind those exact dumpsters on occasion.
Eugene's shoes were too big 😂
Eugine works it better than most girls
At the time around 8:15 you just casually see strippers in the background
Zach or however you spell his name, took the right choice
Zach looked great! and had the most functional footwear
Try pole vaulting
Shout out to all the ladies out there who wear heels on a daily
How do you get youtube red for free???!
That tush got A PUSH
Omg they're sooo funny
I like Ned, but he has a terrible taste.
Eugene is sexy asf
6 inch heeeeels, eugene walked in the club like nobody's business, God damnnn she murdered everybody and I was her witness
I can run in heels 030
I wear 6 inch platform heals and there pretty comfy
Why is Eugene so extra?
Eugene low key won tho 😂😂
they look....FABULOUS!
I wonder how big their feet are? Mine are pretty big and I can never find girl-shoes. I tried yo find some when I came to the US but nothing. I just have some shoes from the UK which I use all the time. 
Though I really don't wear them often. Only if I'm gonna be sitting a lot. I've taken them off to walk around the place barefoot enough not to repeat the mistake!
what was that last bar?
Those boots really work for Zach!! He should keep wearing those!
so much respect for eugene now 😅❤️❤️
The Try Guys lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but they make those high heels work.
Hands down, funniest one yet😂😂😂
"I think I made a mistake ._." .... "Atleast I look hot"

😂😂😂
dont lie we all wanted to be that girl who got down with Eugene
Zach had the best choice but Eugene impressed me with his stamina
This is so funny
Eugene did so well!!! A 6in pump that are too big and more than 2 hours? Wth he makes a better heel wearer than me. Mine are like 4in pumps a little bigger and I am down in an hour plus. I just dance standing where I am.
I STARTED CRY AT 2:32 WHEN EUGENE DID THAT I LOVE HIM
The guy who kept saying he looked hot, but no lady who's bull leggie looks hot, sorry dude.
THAT DROP THO. EUGENE IS THE EPITOME OF SEXY.
I have these 6 inches heels. yeah, wore them once and then never again. they are just sitting in the back of my closet away from light
I like zach's shoes
i tried dagger heals before.....and i fell twice in 1 minute.
zack looked good!
Eugene is my favorite
YAS EUGENE GO BIG OR GO HOME
I love Eugene 😍😍😍
O my, Eugene looks sexy in everything
sees Eugene's shoe
plays Beyoncé's 6 inch
LMAOOOOOO WHEN EUGENE DROPPED IT LOW😂😂😂😂😂
I wanna see them try show choir.
With heels. 
Feel our pain.
I NEED those dagger heels
The shoes basically introduced every kind of girl you will meet. 

Eugene's dancing though... it would make a hooker blush. OMG!! ❤
Eugene made it work so good
Keith and Eugene are the best
PAUSE AT 6:26...WOW!
Am I the only one who keep a pair of flats in my car and/or purse?
Hasn't this already been done?


BY BUZZFEED??
the ankle boots don't count
Heels Kills ... Just don't. 😂
Okay, but when Eugene dropped it like it's hot! Pretty sure I rewatched it like 20 times.
you guys walk like aliens from district 9
I feel you Eugene. Every night I go out is like the one you had. Feeling sexy af. Dancing your heart out, walking realy awkwardly, and at the end just not feeling so much aches that you're just not happy any more. It takes some time to get used to walking in six inch heels, but all my friends are literaly a head or one and half head taller then me. And it hurts my neck more if I have to look up the entire night, then it hurts my feet to walk in heels the entire night. The strangest feeling is definetly walking after you've taken them off. Also: never ever take off your high heels and walk/rest and then put them back on. That hurts even more then keeping them on!!
Best part of wearing heels is taking them off and feeling the blood rush back into your feet.
"They're very special torture devices to make women move very slowly" - Eugene, The Try Guys Try Drag
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt. But I make these high heels work
Eugene shole did mutha fuckin' dance!
Es lo mejor que he visto en mi puta vida 😂😂😂😂
I couldn't wear heels bc I'm 6'6 and I like being able to barely walk under doors
Zack is extraaaaa
"I've may of made a terrible mistake, but I look hot." Eugene 2017
Zach was the only person smart about it
Zach's shoes were cute and sexy and therefore the only ones I would wear. But Eugene wasn't kidding. He was on FIRE in those heels (in more ways than one).
Zach's boot shoes were actually so ring I wear everyday!
"eugene got down harder than I have ever seen a man get down" I LOVE
"My fiancé painted my tunails" 😂
Zach looks so hot.
damn eugene dances soo good lol
Damn, I think I like men in heels
I love zack's shoes!!
Ned should never wear anything that isnt white pants
Eugene is the definition of YAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSS. I live.
I feel like no one's is asking but, where did Eugene get that shirt? did they make a line of clothing?
I gotta say heels are worse than bras
this is going to hurt
is ujean?? gay?
Zach's shoes were adorable
IM DYING THIS IS EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED
I love watching y'all try female stuff.
omg you are all amazing but Eugene SLAYED MY LIFE with his dancing I am deceased
Why do people wear heels if they hurt so much? I love heels and they don't hurt me, but I wouldn't wear them if they were unbearable lol
I love Zach's heels 😫💖 I want them
But I would also wear Zach's entire outfit? Haha
I wore heels to my church communion. I tripped halfway through but no one noticed XD
Lol so good lol. 😂
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSS I just wish they wore platform heels
Eugene can wear heels better than me, and I'm a girl.
I want to be as confident as Eugene
Eugene is just slaying the game!he's slaying my life! he's slaying the universe! 😭❤😍🍑
"But I make these high heels work"-Brendon Urie
Lmao awesome
boots are the most comfortable
1. EUGENE HOLY HELL
2. Yes, welcome. Now you have learned that after a long night, taking off heels is sometimes better than an orgasm
What feminist made this crap men do way harder stuff I'm in life that women
OMFG EUGENE I LOVE YOU
I wish I could dance like eugene 😂
very angry
Zach and Eugene definitely got the best shoes. Should've let Zach wear Eugene's shoes tho I would be super excited to see that lolll
6:06
next try guys try gay sex.
we get it, you want to emphasize all of the little things to make it look like women have it 1000x harder then men. move on to another topic... I could have gotten this from 100 other of your vidoes
I'm a simple girl. I see Try Guys and I click x)
wow looking for any excuse to be a tranny huh.
This is why I never wear high heels... or pointy shoes for that matter
These guys looking like a straight up SNACK
that video was so funny.
"no less than 7 inches" -isabelle lightwood, the mortal instruments
I like Zach's
"My fiancee painted my tunails"
Where can I get Eugene's shirt that says all of their names, I NEED IT
I can't wear heels and I'm a teenage girl
Eugene got the hot heels
I always wondered what Eugene's job was before he joined BuzzFeed...... now I know. He was a stripper. Definitely.
Oh come onn, those ankle boots aren't real heels 😂
Eugene you're such a babe i can't deal 😍
5:46

Eugene why
Alright, let's talk about those pole dancers
Eugene is the only one who really experienced a night out in heels
ned isnt wearing stilettos?
eugene walks like hes on the runway
omg that hole on the floor.
Zach's shoes were the easiest and most comfortable to wear.
i really want zach's shoes tho! legit where did he get them? lmao
I thought this was done before?
oh lord i love them all so much more already
Zach needs to go out with the girl in the middle
I need a Eugene appreciation video, dat guy 😍
I liked Zach's shoes better. I'm entitled to my own opinion so no negativity.
I bet Zach will still use those heels from time to time
Ugh Eugene is just so dang extra
Zach's so adorable
0:26
Looks like the bar from don't threaten me with a good time
Damn neds legs look great in heels XD
Am I the only person that finds Keith annoying
So does Eugene have a boyfriend orrr?
Eugene is the Asian version of Beyoncé
I like zach's shoes so much
Ariel looks so pretty
They should try point ballet it hurts way worse!! 😂
I'm 11 and I can walk really fast 




not trying to be bragging
Every try guys episode has one thing in common....Ned talking about his wife ;)
I don't get fashion. If I wore a heel "from 10 years ago" what kind of person does that make me? Horrible? Idiot? Ugh this annoys me. I get so worked up over the stupidest things.
Eugene is so perfect Jesus 😍
I love how the heels match each guys personality!
Honestly, the ankle boots looked really good on Zach. Am I the only one that thinks men would look good af wearing those?
eugene went ham zach's shoes are shoes i want the most i can do is 4.5" platforms for two hours
Damn, Eugene, I knew you could dance but DAMN.

Also, as a short person, I love six inch heels but boy does that love only last two hours max unless I'm sitting for a majority of the time out. You had a death wish, Eugene, but congrats on making it almost completely through the night!
2:19 SIX INCH HEELS SHE WALKED IN THE CLUB LIKE IT WAS NOBODYS BUSINESS. GODDAMN SHE MURDERED EVERYBODY AND I WAS HER WITNESS.
I'm living for Zach's shoes
I'd where Zach's
Eugene's dancing was amazing
does anyone know where Zach's boots were from?
My prom shoes were taller than Eugene's, they had a wedge on the front and dagger heel. I danced and jumped and ran all night and surprisingly didn't hurt. I'll probably never wear my prom shoes again unless I want to look taller and look scary badass (I was the alternative girl at school and still am)
I can wear stilettos for maybe 7 hours before they get uncomfortable but a chunky heel I can wear al, day
Okay but id wear Eugenes shoes
2:32 Damn Eugene 😏🙌🍑💦😍
Guys, you do realize that high heels were invented by the Persian military to keep the archers in the saddle while they fired arrows upon the enemy. We women later on stole them to look more 'masculine'.
I think the guy with the black boot ones will last the longest because those are the most comfortable or at least that's what I think
dude 2:33 i love it
"But I make these high heels work"
WHY IS EUGENE SO EFFING HOT
Honestly need those black ankle booties😍
Zach's shoes were definitely the most practical
Everyone loves Eugene!!!!!! 😍😍😍
This vid proved that Zack is the smartest 😂😂😂
I think we can all admit that the real winner was Eugene. 6" is A LOT!!!!!! Plus he gets extra points for those moves 😂
Eugene is so fuckin extra and I LOVE IT!
Me and my friend are watching this together. Before that we were watching a puppy play video on YouTube because it just popped out. So right now she wants you (The try guys) to try puppy playing. Just requesting.
That's why I don't wear heals. Also I'm 5'9 and don't need then
Zach's heels were GORGEOUSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
The worst part about wearing heels is when you take them off and your feet hurt even more because they haven't been flat for so long - they're almost moulded to the high arch. I wear what Zach wore for like 8 hours a day, he definitely had the best pair to party in.
6:10 EUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENE
Haha, I'm loving the reactions of the nighttime citizens of WeHo here!
When 4 straigh guys wear high heels before you (and you are gay) XD
Eugene: "I look hot"
Me: "yes you are dammit" sobs
Men look so good in heels! I wish it was more socially exceptable :(
Eugene, marry me.
I've worn heels far longer than four hours and walked farther than a mile. it's all about the heel you choose & breaking them in the day before.
Eugene's shirt😂😍
You almost got hit by a rolls Royce
i can hear raven booting the ankle straps in the distance
Is Eugene gay?
When you wear 4 inch heels everyday.......
When Ned got "cat called "?¿ when was that ? I don't really think being told " welcome to the real world " a cat call
this just drilled it further into my brain to never wear heels. I did once when I was like 8-10 somewhere around that, and I will never do it again. Converse for me all the way
I would wear zach's heels because it looks the most comfortable
Zach's look pretty comfy tbh
Yeah..... heels are evil.... but they do look so damn good. I've sworn off them and choose comfort. I will rock the dress with sneaks... or combat boots.
zach could get those an inch shorter and wear it around and it wouldn't look bad
zach's shoes are wow
i want these 😍😍😂
they need to do the boob weights and heels at the same time,  with club clothes to get the full experience.
Yo zack was smart to get the thick heels boots. Heels with comfort that last longer and doesn't make you look like you have a drinking problem
Eugene dancing 😂😏😍
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eugene would really make it as a drag queen, like bih... those dance moves... I got my LIFE
Eugene had to be extra with those six inch heels. they were cute tho
Eugene's heels look too big. huge mistake Eugene. heels must fit well
Huh..........The only real kinda series on Buzzfeed that isn't man hating
EUGENE WORKS THOSE HEELS!!!
They all looked hot in those heels
instinctive squats lol
My ankle is currently swollen... this is painful to watch
I love zacks heels
Why does Ned have me weak  asf
I wonder if they lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, cause they're makin these high heels work.
"So when I was challenged to dance, I motherfucking danced." -Eugene 

SO INSPIRING.
-You got two entrees?!
-I WAS HUNGRY
OMG! Keith got engaged?! Congrats :D
Zach... WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE SHOES😍
I LOVE EUGENE. WE ALL NEED A EUGENE IN OUR LIVES.
Zack made the safest choice
eugene why did that turn me on
Eugene is so cute😍
Eugene's inner drag queen came out.
I hope they realize that heels were litteraly used as torture devices.
Wow this is great
Heels were made for men, not women
The shoes really resembled who they are
I want Zach's  shoes....
Ned has held the Guinness world record of mentioning his wife everyday of his life.
me when he pulled out the dagger heels: oh no XD I feel like he might fall
i put a dislike because you could do other stuff with your life I mean understand you try to portray how men force women to put on high heels and it's called invisible violence but common...
I NEED the boots Zach is wearing. They're so cute.
Eugene looks HAWT IN LITERALLY EVERTHYING!!
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
Zachs were the best, and does anyone else notice how Eugene always has to go bigger than everyone else, like he's over compensating for something,  lmao.
My favorite thing about taking off heel after a while is being able to pop your toes
I applaud them bc I can't walk in heels at all
"but i look hot" you bet you do eugene, you work those heels!
Eugene had to be extra 😂
Im confusingly attracted to all the try guys now
who is Moroccan here and noticed the tajine ;)
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
Good thing Im 10
What the * are you doing Eugene?!
LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT.
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
Keith's finance is gorgeous
Eugene is my favourite person ever.
Eugene looks so bow legged in those lol
they should wear a small bra, high heels, a tight dress or a dress so long u step on it all the time and a full face of makeup
Eugene for real gave me a boner.
Eugene slaying as always
want zach´s boots
Eugenes so extra hes the best
not trying to sound rude but why do people think Eugene is so hot ? he's a good looking guy but why do people exaggerate ?
Am I the only one who thinks they should all be professional strippers or drag queens
You guys are wrong. Even when you don't have heels you guys are hot af.
Damn Keith that pop tho
don't get me started with Taehyung dancing with high heels
eugene 🍑
SLAY EUGENE !!!!
Lol you can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels 😂😂😂😂😂
Zach should keep those fr
Zach singing, lmaoo😂
where is the part where Eugene flats out?? that was the reaction I was most exited to see!!! please share his reaction face!!
Eugene dear nice moves ;)
Eugene!!!!!! your  hair is gone OMG I loved the hair before
I think Eugene and Ned got catcalled a lot that night lol
Although Eugene flat out, he pretty much won lol Zach's heels don't really count as heels lol they count as everyday shoes....walking in 6in stilettos...I give you mad props Eugene!
Keith has a fiancé 😰
Is Eugene straight ? Just totally curious, no hate :)
Eugene is so amazing
they make those high heels work
their legs look better than mine
Eugene bend and snapped like a pro
these guys are so cute and fun , I hope that my future husband is as cool as these guys😘
I only last maybe two hours in normal heels. I wouldn't even last four hours in heels
like I would totally wear Zach's whole outfit hmu
Eugene looks good in literally everything...... he could wear a garbage bag and rock it
Zac and Keith wussed out with their heels and Keith's feet and fugly! 😆
"I might have made a mistake... but I look hot" me when I'm drunk on apple cider
Yas Eugene actually more than a kitten heel👏🏻🙌🏻👠🙌🏻
Eugene is so cute daaaamn
the whole time im thinking DAYUM EUGENE
EUGENES SHOES WERE WAY TOO BIG. those shoes are expert level heels when they fit, but when they too big, thats impossible and also torture
Zach, most sensible try guy <3
I like Zach's shoes they look so comfortable
I know it's dangerous but I want them to try pointe shoes for a day
I love that the guys don't feel emasculated by doing things like this. This is so cool and they don't seem to give af about what people might say. SLAYYYY TRYGUYS
Eugenes hangover voice at the end hahahahaha
4000th video on this channel
My school shoes had a tiny heel on it and i fell over in them. I cant wear high heels coz ill probably break my ankles 😂
I felt the pain 😢
OMG EUGENE DANG BOI
Hence I wear riding boots or wedges. I left stilettos,pumps anything like that in the dust back in middle school. As a women in university, I will be damned if shoes are the reason I can't go out👠🚫👢✔😎
I am crying... this is SO FUNNY
That part when Eugene dropped it low, HOOWOWOWWOWOWOWOWOWO WHERE CAN I SIGH UP!?
My mom is a shoe designer

Joyce Echols
Is it weird I can run better then I can walk in heels.
zach made the BEST decision
"I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but I make these high heels work"
6 inches are reeeeally hard to walk on. The hardest actually.
Ned kinda reminds me of Katya 😂😂
Eugene always goes hard. ❤️  Love stilettos. It was always hard for me to find stilettos over 4 inches.
if you need to learn to wear heels talk to dr. frankenfurtur
Eugene cares sooo much about what other people think!! it's so annoying, always trying to impress others. Who cares what others think?? just be yourself man!
Zach is an adult version of adam golberg from the goldbergs tv show
I don't care how good those shoes look. If they make your feet actually bleed. nope.
Keith really doesn't need to get taller.
eugene killed it pls
Try Guys, Ladylike and Worth It all in one day!!!!! Buzzfeed on firee <3
I thought Eugine would have a dress on
I am a girl and I never wore 6 inches of heels 👠😒😒😒
YOU GUYS WE FINALLY MET KIETH'S FIANCEE
Wait what does eugenes shirt say ?
Ned's wife is sooooo beautiful. Keith's fianceé is, too.
I hope this video motivates dudes who've always wanted to wear heels in public do it✨ even though none of them role that way they look pretty good in them!
Is it just me or are gugene's legs look sexier
Eugene looks fine with high heels👌
Yeah, this video has reaffirmed why I almost never wear heels...
I want dagger pumps now
Lol Eugene is just like, beauty is pain you gotta do what you gotta do
How did Eugene last a whole night in those
I can't even wear those for 5 min
Good shoes bring you to good places...😂😂😂😂😂
Y'all know and aware that Eugene is gay, right? he's a fabulous one! 😁 no seriously, he's gay. 😊
Zach played it safe, Neds rocking it, Keith is both shocked and a natural, Eugene has no idea what he signed up for.
it was no surprise that eugene chose the most extreme heels. also i want zach's outfit in my size it was cute
Zach's shoes aren't that far fetched as a normal unisex boot. Very reminiscent of Harry Styles. If I'd seen him out and about in those shoes I wouldn't think they were heels at all.
Why does eugene look amazing in everything
I feel like Zach looks super casual like a natural
if women hate wearing heels sm, stop wearing them?
holy sht Eugene LMAO he is TURNT
Oh my gosh Eugene is so badass
am I the only one who thinks heels are easy to wear and walk in?
YAY MORE TRY GUYS
Dem noice legs
Wonder if Eugene got the girl he danced with number
Zach's shoes are nothing, I wear heels higher than that everyday
I want Eugene's Try Guy shirt!!!!
Its actually pretty unfair for Ned, Keith, and Eugene.. Its like Zach's heels is more comfortable and not that hard to walk on. I actually had that heels and i always wear it.. Zack should be trying the heels that Ned and Keith is wearing so it will be fair. But damn Eugene.. Why is he more sexy than i am? :(
I'm actually surprised Eugene lasted that long, those are some extreme heels, especially for beginners. Man i respect him
I fell like Zach had a More easy heel because it wraps around his whole foot
Zach, making the only good decisions as always
Eugene needs to give me those heels right now. I am LIVING.
"But I make these high heels work"
6 Inch heels, Eugene walked in the club like nobody's business, goddamn, he murdered everybody and I was his witness
zach was smart choosing the boots
I just want Becky and Ariel to be BFFS.
whoever edited this video is in love w ned's butt and im not complaining
i think i have a thing for eugene in dagger heels now tHANKS A LOT
Zach's went really well with his outfit
I wear Zachs heels like every day for hours and I live in nyc
Spike heels are evil.
Zachs shoes were sooo pretty
do The Try Guys wear Platform shoes next !
Ok let's not lie, Zach totally won this
in love with Zacks heels
Thay should do people become vegetarian 's for a week
Zach looks hella like the shoes go with his outfit and he looks gr8
Bless eugene my best stilettos are 6.1 inches and I've made an uber take me for 2 blocks before
Eugene is hot with or worhout his heels
Eugene HAS to be gay
welcome gentleman to the dark side! Taking off heels, stockings, bras, and makeup IS LIBERATING SOOOO MUCH OMG! oh, and weaves lol. and to think that Beyonce and Lady Gaga wears all of that for entire concerts!
Heels were originally made for men and women only wore them to be like a man
I honestly wished "Don't threaten me with a good time" played I hope someone understands that reference 😂
AHAHAHA EUGENE XD
Eugene basically was Cheyenne Pepper that night
i wore 3 inch heels foor a whole day at age 14 at a convention
i thought they already did this video?
2:31 God damn.
it's showing 8 toes if it's hiding your baby toes....not 7
sees legs in thumbnail Dammit Zack...(I was guessing)
Y'all did this already.
Eugene is so hot 😍
see how tough girls are
tbh i don't even doubt eugene looks good in everything anymore, he could shave his head and bleach his eyebrows and idk wear 4-sizes-bigger shoes, he'd still look hot. also, zach's high heels looked gooooood in him omg
Why? Because Eugene, that's why.
Ankle boots were the smart choice
ZACH YOU SHOULD WEAR INSOLES :D
I just realized Zach's heels actually really work with his look, and he should totally wear those regularly. 

Just sayin.
I think all guys should experience this haha
eugenes dancing  😍
Loooove this vid
i love how most of them are wearing 3 or 4 inch heels, which i wore when i was twelve, and eugene goes for six inches
I cant unsee what i just saw
"Who's that man walking down the street with the delicate feet?"
The Try Guys is the only reason I still watch BuzzFeed
Eugene is so extra and we love it
Neds butt is 11/10
Kieths Tall legs are model material
Of course Eugene is the one who does the absolute most
6:10 thank me later
and what are you supposed to do if you live in the UK where YouTube red doesn't work
Zach was the only smart one
"lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt but I make these high heels work" - bebo
Welcome to the world of women!!!  I don't wear them unless I have to.....but they do make you look good!!  haven't worn heels in almost a year...won't be wearing them again until August for my high school reunion.....love the guys when they do these things!  and I LOVE ZACH!!!!!  i'm to old for him but damn he's cute!
There's nothing worse than wearing loose stilettos 😂😭
Eugene got DOWN.
I am Eugene
2:30 😂😂 slay
Keith's heels can't be a kitten heel if it's three inches. Kitten heels are an inch or so.
"Dinner is sitting, sitting is great" 

My new motto
Zach must've been overreacting or just faking it because those shoes are wayyy more comfortable idek why they let him wear those
God Eugene is extremely attractive
The car that almost hit Zach was a Rolls-Royce Ghost Series 1.
Eugene's heels looked like at least half a size too big. That plus 6 inches equals a lot of unnecessary extra pain lol.
I have a 8 inch stilleto and it is hard af now you know how it fells
And this is why I think heels are an oppression device. Sorry, fashion.
that thumbnail tho
I think I have all of those shoes (or just really similar ones) :D
I honestly envy how hot Eugene looks in everything
Zach and Eugene tho
2:32 DAAAANG BOY, TEACH ME YOUR MOVES BC YOU LOOK HOT AF.
More videos that aren't on redtube please!
zachs are a thicker heel hes fine
ZACK LOOKS SO FREAKING  GOOD IN THOSE 👠!!!
Omg i totally agree with the problem of feeling like a burden because you wanna leave halfway through the night because your feet are basically bleeding 🙃🙃
Eugene and zack looked A1 in their heels 😍💕😂
I'm just really curious to know if Eugene or Zach would ever wear those shoes again for another night out. Anyway, this was great.
"I may have made a terrible mistake.....but I look hot"
RELATABLE
Am I the only girl who wears heels and doesn't hurt my feet.
I can't even breath in heels wtf
KEITH PROPOSED??????
eugene and zack looked so good in their heels, hot damn
I want the shoes Zach was wearing
Zack had it so easy ! His heels were chunky
Ugene and Ned actually looked good. Like dayum. 😏😂
Eugene, ALWAYS has to go big or go home. SMDH
eugene is gay?
Zach if you like them and they're comfortable, wear the f**ck out of them boo
1:00 I LOVE ZACH

also i want those shoes
When does YouTube red come to the uk.
Why are Keith's toes nicer than mine
eugene is my aesthetic
I like Eugene 's shirt
GO ZACH!!!!!!!!!
I see Eugene...I click
zachs heels are cute i would uy them
becky is so cute omg
I wish I was a try guy.
WHEN EUGENE DID THAT BODY ROLL THO OOOOH. zach also looks super super good in those boots
I think the only smart ones were zach and Keith. What the hell is Eugene thinking!!
I wear heels higher than Zach's on a daily basis hahaha.
Wtf was up with that "welcome to the real world" guy????
damn son that's some hella toned legs you got there
after the video, did anyone else go back to see Eugene's dancing?
Eugene is like: "Drop it like it's hot."
Heels have soooooo many health risks when it comes to your feet
YOU HAVE DESCRIBED MY LIFE!!!!! I gave up on heels and wear platform sneakers now, still got the hight (super short) and I feel great but super comfy and I party all night
'i lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but I make these high heels work'
... This is me every day... I feel you guys <3 I apologize for the pain, but holy shit - It looked great!
Zach's are the most practical he should wear them more often, heels really aren't that bad unless you get motherfucking daggers like Eugene
"Why am I painting all of my toes when you can only see about ... 7?" Yasssss
I could last the night in Zach's heels tho lmao they look hella comfortable
They lasted longer than I usually do! 😄
the key is to get very very drunk so you don't feel the pain 😂😂😂
I won't wear heels more than an hour
3:56 the new season of Yuri on ice
why you change locations so much!? when I go out I stay in one place the whole night unless is really boring
YES EUGINE, WORK IT!!
Eugene in heels 10/10
I still think Zach looked the cutest in the shoes!
4:14 awww isn't Eugene's shirt so adorable?
Eugene would get the biggest highest heels.
TUNAILS
now those r heels ugene
i hope they broke those in
Eugene dancing....👌👌👌👌👌👌life
zacks out fit works with those heels and he looks supper cute
jesus eugene
I'm a ballet dancer and I constantly walk on my toes, so wearing heels later in life will be easy lol
I would prob wear Zachs but I don't even wear heels
"I can't compete with that" 😂😂😂
Now try this with the boob weights and being on your period like in that one non try guys video where men try to period for 3 days.
of course Eugene goes hard lol love it
is it just me, or do those heels Zach picked out actually look good with his outfit.
I guess I'm weird cause I wear four inch heels almost every day and I love it.....
Eugene is such a queen 😍
the fact that they walk in heels better than me is sad
Hey can anyone explain why people go from bar to bar I just turned 18 in October btw so new to all of that lol
why does ned have a better butt than me
zac's weren't even heels
Eugene and zach dropping in heels is everything
Did you know in the 70s men wear high heels and then in the 80s they stopped an then in the 90s woman wear high heels
so happy I'm a male f being a female shits way to hard
Hopefully this will knock some sense into those bitches who torture themselves with heels.... Men will love you just the same without them so get over yourselves ...
For me high heel are easy to were and i'm 10 so...
I would have done a wedge with a peek toe
I use ankle boot heels like that everyday like
Omg Keith's fiancé is gorgeous. But so is Ned's wife.
i would honestly wear zach's whole outfit
Eugene is a hot dancer
dammn i would wear zach's whole outfit lmao
omg ariel and eugene's reactions when ned fell
I LOVE EUGENE
zach's heels were so cute i want them. also don't think ive ever been more in love with eugene?
Thats my kink
What is the name of the outfit that girl at 4:03 is wearing? The one holding the pink phone! I need to know!
Damn, Zach looks good in those boots. He should wear those regularly
Zach's shoes look good on him
so gay..
Eugene was feeling his oats
Eugene has better balance in 6inch heels then I do in flats😂
I'm think Zach will last the longest
Okay no kidding Zach's hills weren't even bad at all, I would wear that every single day without any problem
Keith has a fiancée?!
I've got to admit Eugene, you're right. You look really good in heels! All of you do.
Can I just say that the alcohol takes the pain away.
Zack better keep those boots, cause he was rocking them! He looked so good in them!
Zach is at his sexiest omg
zac is so adorable his heels
Zach looked hot, i dug the heels
Hello Ned's butt!
i lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but i make these high heels work
I love how they throw the heels in the bin 😂😂
Let's just pray that Eugene is never going to leave buzzfeed?
I need Eugene's shirt omg
Ok ...Man in Heels are weirdly hot.... And slay
My lord, the try guys are just killing me!! Haha
Oh hell yeah, im all about those dagger pumps
they should have shown the next day and how painful and bad it is the next day (especially for Eugene) when it feels like it would be the best to cut your feet off
This is why I wear platforms and thick heels
Try wearing heels after you've had back surgery, that's why I never wear them , I did once and never again will I wear heels
someone's gotta send zach those lift insoles if he really feels that much more confident with the extra inch or two
I would 100% wear Zach's shoes
Is it the same with insoles? If so, then I feel sorry for Jimin 😂
(jk)
I love shoes...but I would you give up eating chocolate, or wear Crocs for the rest of your life?
Eugene isn't gay cuz he's a boss with the women BUT his metrosexuality is teetering on the line of homosexuality lol. Ain't nothing wrong with that
When I'm challanged to dance...I motherf*king dance😂💙 it literally made my day
Obviously eugene had to wear the highest shoes he's so extra I love him.
Ned has a nice butt. Now the try guys know how much pain woman go through to wear heals. Although, I feel really bad for them because they might not be able to walk for a couple hours after this.
I ve always wanted the Try Guys to do this I m so happy thank you Keith , Ned , Zach and Eugene
I questioned Eugene's sexuality when he danced in those heels😂😂
y is eugene so hot?!?!😫
haven't watched the whole video yet,, so maybe this happens, but, I wanna see the next morning charlie horse reaction
They already beat me
 They made it out the door with heels 😂😂😂
late squad where you at
Ariel and Ned are the cutest couple ever!
Zac looks fine af in those boots
"not wasted, just wearing heels". lol. story of my life.
hahaha
6:14 its official. Eugene is my spirit animal
Ariel is so pretty omg
I can't even wear heels
Zach's rant about being short and girls wearing heels is literally what I live for😂
"If you slap on 4 extra inches, I can't compete with that!"
I love Neds wife
Of course Eugene has to do The Most™
DAMN! Eugene can work it 👌🏼💃🏻🙌🏼
does anyone else ship eugene & zach 💀💀
I like heels, except the part about destroying your feet
Buzzfeed doesn't block swear words anymore? (Haven't watched this channel in a while)
"I may have made a terrible mistake..but I look hot" YAS SAME
is it just me or does zac look good
WARNING WARNING : GAY VIDEO ._.
I think guys look hot in heels but it makes sense because they were originally made for men.
I think Eugene in high heels is my new kink
are eugene and zach dating?
Keith has a fiance now?! 😮
Is no one going to mention the strippers in the last bar? Must have been a really crazy night
YAY EUGENE
lol im 13 and im wearing Daggers with comfortability, i hate heels but i feel fabulous and tbh i thought it would be hell, i wasnt so MAN UP
zach didn't complain at all, he was so good!
this entire video is literally just the timeline of me in pointe class
This video made my life!My god was Ned funny
Um Zach pulls those off really well???
I love how they all went for safe options, low heals and then there's Eugene😂😂
damn zach, where u get them boots. need me some of those
now try the shoes with the boobs.
Zach had the best heels but Eugene look the sexiest.
Eugene and Ned with those booties <3
"Bar to Bar at the speed of sound"

"But I make these high heels work"
I swear if Eugene leaves I'm officially done with buzzfeed 😐end of mother effin story
i actually wants zachs heels lmao
"What advice do you have for us?"
"Don't."
Fucking love Ariel!
High heels were acc made for men
Please do the 
Try Guys Try Find Something Eugene Can't Do
How did they all look so good in heels! Impressed!
Eugene your beyonce index is over 3000 ♡ lov ya
wait is that shane dawson's producer?????
Maybe all mangers that want make high heels the dress clothes for work should do this
I just keep rewatching the Try Guys  videos cause they just keep me super entertained. I hope you guys try LARPing  (live action role play) I'd love to see that. XD
6:23 - 6:30 what is happening (the answer is fusion ) lmao woo you go amethyst aka Eugene
You should've done it for a week with different ones every day
I walk like ned in heels 😂😂
Why isnt this noted as a try guys video?
Zach had it easy they had a large base which are WAYYY easier to walk in that the daggers
I wanna go out drinking with Eugene ngl
"I go by a dumpster and take of maa heels" yep that's usually how the night ends.
Can anyone help me? http://www.gofundme.com/movingclosertofamily
Whoever came up with this, must be really, really bored. I bet they were thinking "Yo, we're running out of ideas... Hey I know! Let's get a bunch of guys to wear heels and make a full 10 minute video about it" I love buzzfeed❤️
Zach looked so good tho wtf
All that Try Guys does is prove that Eugene can do everything better than everybody
Nice to see them realising the struggle. My job when I was 17-18 made us all wear minimum 4 inch heels for our 8+ hour shifts and it was BRUTAL.
wow i would actually wear zach's outfit...
6:24  0_0
Every try guy video ever: Ned: But doesnt it make my butt look good?
thats the crazyest i have ever seen eugene
Zach won, but in all fairness he did pick the most practical pair of heels.
I wore 5 inch plus heels every day for over 10 years and now my feet are deformed, I can literally walk on my toes. Do this as a challenge, or wear heels for at least a week and then we're talking. 😀
Can the Try Guys do acrylic nails?
I'm Eugene... I don't wear heels to play I wear them to slay. Get out of here with kitten heels
honestly, what ELSE would eugene wear?
ive never wanted to wear heels, but zach's looked fuckiN awesome i kinda want them
Imagine wearing heels, being on your period and being drunk (ughhhhh)
When ever I wear heels I look like a hunchback but when they do it they look awesome
zach is literally the smol-est thing ive ever seen aww
I see how short the heels are and the shortest pair of heels I wear are 6 inch stiletto (The height of Eugene's pair)....I'll wear them all day and run in them with no problem lol. Maybe its because I'm a girl but idk... and Zach's are barely heels lol.
Little jealous of the girl dancing in Eugene's lap.. .
The try guys is the main reason I've stayed subscribed to buzzfeed for so long😍😂
They now knw the struggle is fucken real and eugen he did look hot
i didn't know how much i needed this until i realized i needed this!
2:25 so long god damn
owwww
Zack's heels looked so cute
But i make these high heels work
can i be the "EUGENE IS SO HOT LOOK AT HIS BUTT AT 2:31" comment for this video????
Poor Ned... He's adorable.
Ned's legs and tush looked A-friggen-mazing in those heels though, damn!
zack was the easy ones I wear boot heels everyday
Welcome to the females night
If only they could simulate pronation in the feet. That would show them true pain.
Who was the girl dancing with Eugene?
Eugene is so beautiful
i love Eugene so much
but let's take a look on Eugene's
 t-shirt, so cute ^__^
i lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but i make these high heels work
I HAVE THE SAME ANKLE BOOTS AS ZACK!!! They are so comfortable.
Eugene is doing stuff to me mentally i just wanna watch him dance all day
Zach: What is happening 
I was dying!!!! 😂😂😂
This, ladylike and unsolved is literally the only thing I watch on buzzfeed🙃🙃
zach looks good with ankle boots on honestly
The Try Guys and Worth It are my favorite
zachs are the best
heels: 2017's torcher device
I actually think that Eugene looks nice.
where can I get the shirt Eugene had on with all their names on it?
why dont they wear platform heels they're much easier. even i dont wear heals
'keith would you be a dear'
so cute
Perks of being a tall girl:
Wearing heals is a fashion mistake 

The only fashion rule I obey tbh
Eugene has worn heels before. remeber try guys try try fake preg at bellies?  and try guys try drag? and people learn iconic dances? yeah, Eugene is an experienced person in the art of wearing high  heels
My life goal is dancing with Eugene.
i made a terrible mistake but I look hot
If you dont wear them long enough that it hurts more to be flat footed for thirty minutes then you dont know real pain m8
Ah, this video made me want heels.
it's even worse when you stay the night at a friend's after a night in heels and you forget any flats and have to put the heels back on the next morning to go home...
Eugene is low key thicc
"Welcome to the real world" I'm dying gOd the assholes of the world
I wasn't going to click on this vid, but then I saw those three simple words: the try guys.and I clicked faster than you can say "Eugene is hot."
but I make these high heels work 👠
1:01 OH MY GOOOOD
(Don't read if you're easily irritated and an anti) 

This makes me remember about the time in which V danced and jumped in high heels with no problem
Kim Taehyung can slay in heels with no practice..
But I make these high heels work! 
Am I the only one who could only think of P!ATD while watching this, and that Brendon should have joined in this?
I would choose Zach´s heels. They look comfortable. But if I wear heels, I usually take flats with me also so I can change if I need to.
Eugene  is the only one of them that took the right heels the rest of them are just finding easy ones
"So when I was challenged to dance..
I motherfucking danced"

God I love that man
Eugene's heels are to big. There shouldn't be a gap that big between the back of his ankle and the shoe.
Dormtainment..
when eugene started dancing I died
how talk are you? I'm 5'7 😌
did no one notice that they went to a strip club and you could clearly see a girl on the poll?
bar to bar at the speed of sound... fancy feet dancing through this crowd... Oh yah!
Eugene is literally me, lmao. 6 inches are my go-to, and it's always painful AF but the reasoning "I look hot" keeps you going xD
they all looked great in heels tho. (I think Eugene's might have been a little too big) but Ned's calves and his butt??? Even better with heels
They should've given the advice that you should always buy heels the right size and preferably one size smaller than usual.... Because Eugenes heels were way too big lol it still looked good though
I had a dream that Ned got a butt reduction. I don't know why but I was sad and concerned..until he asked about his butt and then I realized everything was okey. 😂😂😅😅
Disappointed that Eugene didn't sing 6 Inch by Beyonce.
Zach's shoes is the most comfortable tbh
I like Ned's outfit lol
Zach has high heels that I might actually wear, his are the safest
next: the try guys try periods
Ngl those heels looked really good on Zach
I know the pain lol I'm a woman lmao.. I'm happy they experience wearing high heels.. high heels are sexy but deadly 💀👍🏼😂😊🙌🏻
Ok, you guys all look hot! xD
zach is me in heels lol
why am I not surprised that Eugene was the hottest when dancing??
Is Keith marrying a woman or a man?
Eugene always gotta be so extra hahahahhaha
Zach's shoes were probably the easiest. If I ever want to go out looking good without the pain of heels, those are the type of boots I would pull out.
Ankle boots are like an everyday wear for me. They would definitely be the last ones to flat out.
Eugene had the hardest heels though hands down
I love how Eugene always goes all out , he had on the craziest heels , i wanna be friends with him
goddamn eugene had some impressive heels
im dying
Eugene love yours
Con los años dejas de sentir dolor extremo
I actually think guys should wear heels, like as a social norm because, the guys all looked really good in them.
How does Eugene look good in literally anything
Did I hear Stacy Q in the background ?
Zach looks so cute but Eugene could literally step on me i would thank him
Where did zach get those shoes 😍
Ned and Ariel are so cuteeee 😭😭😭❤❤❤
Honestly Eugene is me
They are so hot, love those heels
omg... the whole time watching this i was so scared someone was going to roll their ankle
Can you please do this: Try guys were long hair for a day, I'm talking about down to their butts length
I would wear those little boots, damn they're cute.
The best thing about feels is the amazing feeling of taking them off after a long day.Also i want Zack's boots
Keith and Ned are shirt twinsies.
EUGENE'S DANCING. OH. MY. GOD.
I wear 3 inch boots almost every other day lmao
BuzzFeed should make a "Women wear a beard for a day" video. Who's with me?
So i was challenged to dance 

I muther fucken danced 
        😂😂😂😂😂 -----Eugene 2k17
Eugene. Aims To Slay.
Eugene is a badass
Eugene is a beautiful man
I'm sorry but isn't Zach cheating?
Zach's boots fit him so well I'd love him to wear more!!!
a good way to describe this video "I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK" Que that thing Brendon does when he say he makes the high heels work
I would have given up if I was bleeding or falling!
like so they will post thier 4000th vid
They look like failing drag queens
Hate heels, love boots! I prefer platform, but if a wicked leather knee-high has a couple inches, I'm down!
i dont even have words
This was honestly the best try guy video! Absolutely love it 💐 you go guys 😘
the Try Guys need to try either stripper heels or stripping! try not only walking in those, but also dancing in those for 12 hours a night! my feet are in pain 24/7
Look at all those booties~
Low Eugene 6:09 was just too much
Yeah, imagine having a job that requires walking for over 8h, and having to work in heels... that sucks, even in the most comfortable heels...
Ned has some fuckin L E G S and booty in this vid ! Yaaas !
Is it bad that I would wear all those heels? For like a whole day..... I know .... I'm bad
Only the beginning and I already love it.  Becky, Katie and Ariel at the start was a nice touch.  Well, Zach's are cute! And look totally doable.  Aw, Keith's nails look great!  Wish I had such nice, broad nails to paint.  Or, rather, be painted for me.  Ned, what were you thinking with a narrow, three-inch heal on a silver shoe?  Not cute, especially with that outfit.  And as for Eugene, I'm shaking just my head but every fiber of my being says no.  Uhoh incline.  Wow Katie looks great!   Love that outfit!  That black, flowy jumpsuit.  So cute.  And those heels work. 

Whoa okay four plus hours that's impressive.  Lots of sitting which I totally understand but that was a good long run in heels.  Ned and Keith good for you for saving your feet.  Zach's feet are going to be fine.  His Achilles might be a bit sore the next day but he's so stable.  Eugene though.  Yah, stabbing yourself in the brain with a heel I get that.  Wait did he just hit on that blonde so he could lean on the gate?  Or on her?  Oh he's going to be in such pain.  Owch.
Eugene with high heels looks really really hot. 

It's weird.
no one gonna acknowledge eugene's dancing?
sees a Try Guy in the thumbnail and clicks on video cos I'm easily sold
That moment you realize that Eugene was like 6'6" in this video
Except Eugene's I have tried all of them
I like how Eugene challenged himself because he already knew how to walk in heels
To be fair, if those shoes were right out of the box then that means they probably weren't properly broken into yet which makes everything even more painful.
He shoe too big for he got dam feet!
Love this and love them
Zack looks good tho
It's all fun and games until you step on some stones and have to dive into a dumpster to retrieve your shoes 😂
I'm not sure if those heels are enough for Gaga 😂😂
I wear heels that have a cover and aren't that high
Eugene looks good in everything!!! Howwww??? LOL.
why are they bending their knees so much? I wear heels, but this never happened, why???
Some women have to wear those to work because they are considered professional.
Of COURSE Eugene would pick the sexiest heel....when is he ever not sexy?? Lol
I heard Ned went to Yale... and here he is, wearing heels and doing some other ridiculous stuff.
They lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt...
But they make them high heels work! :')
I think I got gayer for Eugene

I'm 18 in two years, call me then, Euguene ;)
Of course Eugene chooses the most dramatic heels
Omg Eugene at the and with his feet, ouch 😖
i am never ever going to wear heels.
I don't know why they are doing this. They wore heels when they did drag.
Buzz feed like omg it's so hard for women to wear heels U DONT NEED TO
Coitado do Eugene :( :(
99% of the comments say how Eugene looks hot in anything
Ugean: so when I was Challenge to dance I motherfucking danced 

Me : dying of laughing too much😂😂😂
This test is kinda relative tho cos the heavier the person the more painful it is as there's more weight on the heels. Like Keith is a tall man so surely it's gonna hurt more than on someone like Zach
That's why you only buy heels that are comfortable.....
😭 I WANT CUTE ANKLE BOOTS and my best friends always holds my hands when I wear heels
Eugene's a baller lmao
Erm zach. have you tried creepers ?
Ned's hair looks good ngl
sus af just close down your company
I love their wives/girlfriends/friends, the ladies were awesome
Neds moves and but though!
6:08 just like OMG!!
Eugene looks hot in anything!
Toddlers on ice skates lmao
Eugene looks like he's magically balancing on his tippy toes lmao
Did they make those high heels work? Wheres the man in a chiffon skirt?
Of course Eugene had the hottest shoes. Of course Eugene looked hot as hell in them.
Eugene is literally my spirit animal😂😂😭😭😭😭💕👍
XD LOL
lol i am a girl and i hte helles
Not gonna lie, Zach is my spirit animal...
Eugene totally fucked that chick who grinded him! Haha
Knew it was WEHO!
7:14 that place reminds me of smosh
Okay, when is Eugene not hot?
Zach's heels looked great and I suddenly want to wear them?????? hmm..
2:36 YAASSSSSSS!!!!
This video made my heels hurt lol
Eugene the blessing
They wear heels better than I do in a million years.
They shouldve had the girls go with them and wear heels and see how they handle it
guys that's why you take a pair of pumps with you as well
The only thing Ned cares about is if his butt looks good. every video 'does it make my butt look good'
The guy who stepped on Ned pissed me off, if it was Eugene On the other hand I would be plotting murder if somebody hurt bae
i think only eugenes were bad
zac has the easiest one
Y A S E U G E N E
Zachs shoes are the only one of them I would wear for a night out. What's the purpose of shoes you can't dance in?
The give it a whirl fuckers
I'm a girl and I would never wear any of these, except for zach's boots
I would wear zach's heels
Of course eugenes heels are 6 inches
Eugene walked into the club like nobodys buisness ✋💜
Hahahaha A+ music choice @ Mozart's Requiem coming on when Eugene unwrapped those dagger pumps... "Confutaaaatis, malediiiiictis, flaaamis acribus addiiictis"... Ominous much? XD
Funny, but I thumbed it down because this was a hard watch. Thx.
i can't even find heels in my size, i'm mad
it's March now.   there is still a price. uhhh.   am I missing something
1:44 - 1:51 possibly the most adorable thing I've seen in my life time.
Zack rocked those heels xD
You buy your hills half a size smaller than you actually are. That's why eugene didn't fit.
Jebus Christ look at all the music used in the description
Keith looks even more of a giant with his heels
we can call Eugene the king that can slay a queen bee
Someone tell my why Eugene pulls it off more than I
Eugene is my spirit animal.
I want Eugene's heels
At my school there's a girl that wears high heels every day there like 6 inches or even more and she even runs in them in gym
0:12 is how I walk every time I wear heels.
Love Eugene's but here really just for the bedroom lol.
Eugine is extra af
These guys literally make Buzzfeed interesting 😂😂😂
Once again, Eugene is perfect
Ned is such a dad
I love Eugene's dancing
He lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt but Eugene makes those high heels work
You know, it really make you wonder does the money they get worth it?
i really wanted to see one of them in wedges
eugene is the most hilarious guy ever
"when i was challenged to dance, i mother***** danced!" yessssss
I wore heels to school....i got on the bus and immediately regretted it. I put on my flip flops at 12:30. I was close only had 1 more class.
so true about drinking just masking the heel pain
Does anyone know the brand of the black ankle boots he's wearing ?
"The try guys" videos are the only videos that make sense and have meaning on BuzzFeed
Anyone know where Zach's booties are from? 😮
Zach should wear the boots if he feels more confident in them. They look great
I feel so bad for dudes who end up feeling short when I wear heels, lmao, there should be shoes that have like, raised insides but they look normal on the outside, just so that short dudes can feel taller 😂that's why I like heels 'cause I'm like five feet tall, but I'm a girl so that doesn't count as much 😂😂
I call them ankle breakers
Eugene is so extra 😂
"But i look hot" 
When don't you Eugene
There is such thing as comfortable heels. Heeled boots are the most comfortable. If they have a wider, block shaped heel then they'll be easier to walk in and won't hurt nearly as much. Also, keeping it realistic for your foot is always more comfortable. I've got two pairs of black heeled boots like that and they are very comfortable for me to walk in and I can wear them all day. They're great. I can run in them too. Though personally I prefer flat shoes/boots.
Work it queens! 😝✌️😂❤️
Awww come on guys i wear 7in stilettos with 2in platforms most nights as a drag queen!!!!!
Is it weird that I want Zack's shoes? I have the grey version of them with a silver zipper and shorter. Lol.
Why do guys stick their knees way out when they walk in high heels? Lol 😂😂
Where are Zacks heals from!?!?
"When I got challenged to dance... I motherfucking danced."
dUDE LOOK AT kIM tAEHYUNG
My husband Eugene was again proves he's amazing
How Eugene walks in 6 inch heels is still better than I can do in 3 inch heels.
They should've worn the same type of heels so that it would be fair because Zachs heels are way more comfortable than eugenes heels and that's why zach lasted longer
Eugene is actually me tbh
If anybody could wear six inch heels, Eugene can.
"Keithhh, would you be a dear" Forget his wife, i ship it.
Zach basically wasn't even wearing heels
P.s. Eugene looks HOT
But I make these highheels work
Zach and his outfit won all of this night!
"When I stood in those six-inch stilettos I look f*cking hot as sh*t" 😂😂
I want to be a "Try guy" HAHAHAHAHA So much fun.
What about the try guys try to stop trying forever?
So basically.. Try guys is now '' Experience your privilege, you fuckin' white male '' .. Can you go camp or get drunk again please you pitiful, emasculated betas'?
tbh zach looks so good
Zach's heels were so cute! I'd be totally down to wear those, thick boot heels are the best and are so comfortable (Compared to other heels)
Ned looks hot!
I have the same shirt as zach 😂
Why do [high heel wearers] do this to themselves??!?!?!
Of course Eugene got the highest ones 😂
I love dagger heels... if the heels aren't 5-6 inches or taller then I won't wear them, but I love ankle booties heels those are the exception 😂😂
Zac looks so cute
Imagine being the girl that Eugene danced on
If anyone knows where the black booties are from that zach wore then someone please tell me lol
I wear Zach's heels everyday.....
when you have to google how much 3 inches is in centimetres 😂
The try guys to Marine Corps 54 Hour Crucible
EUGENE DANCING IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN
They walk how I walk when I have period cramps
Man spreading
"nope not wasted, just wearing heels" OMG SO RELATABLE 😂 I tripped over a carpet and slammed into my friend clubbing once and they kicked me out. I HAD ONE SHOT 😂
Of course Eugene goes full out with 6 inch heels😂
Zach has comfortable 3 inches boots and Eugene has the worst type of high heels? Not fair
In my country ,there are some weddings and sweet sixteen's parties that give flip flops near its  end.
zach's heels were the best and smartest, of COURSE he didn't have any trouble! I think i have those heels, too! they're so cute!
I think they all looked awesome in heels! guys should definitely wear more heels!!! Zach totally looked cutest this vid <3
Can we honestly say that any of them lost though?!
Can we just appreciate the fact that Eugene was wearing six inch stilettos that were TOO BIG for his feet?? Major props
finally a video
is eugene gay
Eugene, why must you look so good in everything??
lmfaooo i started laughing the 5 seconds in to the video
Omg Eugene! XD
Zach looked really good im gonna be honest
Ned's butt looked 👍 great
6:26 omg i wanna be that girl
Keith is me towards high heels
I would Definitely wear Zack's shoes! 😍😍😍
MOTHERF'N EUGENEEEEEEEE
What is the name of the asian eyes child
Eugene is so wild!! Grrr 🐯
we need a ladylike/try guys collab
hmmmmm......i've gone shopping at walmart and several other places for a project in ankle boots that have heels literally the size of my face with my friend.....she had to pull them off of me.
was that laganja and shangela???
also does that mean eugene and keith are now both 6'6
Damn those boaties
Eugene looks hawt.
Eugene is something special and i love him and we all love him
THEY LOOK LIKE SATYRS
DAMN EUGENE
honestly tho, Zac looks super hot in those ankle boots. he should rock those more often 👌
I NEED ZACH'S SHOES OMF!
I don't wear heels. EVER. But in the right circumstances I would give the ones Zach is wearing a shot! They're cute. And they seem like they would kill you just a little slower than the rest of them 😃
I feel soft whenever I imagine them wearing chokers IDK WHY I JUST FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO SEE EUGENE AND ZACH  WEARING THEM REGULARLY
I walk in 5 in heels no platform for 6 hours straight without pain. I must be a rare woman cuz y'all can't go 3 hours in a four inch
i cant say if eugene's a sadist or a masochist but those heels... god i would rather go barefoot
I think I would wear Zach's shoes, to be honest
Zach has t easy!!!
They... actually kindy looked hot in those shoes...
zach actually looks kind of cute in ankle boots.
As a short person, I always wear heels when I go out so I definitely feel Zach on that front. I've learned that putting bandaids on the main places that get hurt the most BEFORE you go out can help you last longer too! :3
Clicked for Eugene, stayed for... well Eugene
Eugene.... a personal hit to every single person self esteem including super models. He's literally perfection in human form. Dammit. And I'm not attracted to him, I just appreciate how bloody stunning he is. 
Oh the jealously burns.
I usually wear six inch heels the whole night, but the good thing is the feeling you get when taking them off
freaking Eugene
Did anyone else want to be that girl that Eugene um danced with? Lol
Is eugene bi?
This relates so much to Don't threaten me with a good time 😅
Lol I wear Zach's heels for comfort around the house.
yes eugene looks good HAHAHAH
They all looksoooo hoooot
4:13 I WANT THAT SHIRT
Eugene was wearing a try guys shirt! I want one!
TCU
there is no way i could walk in any of those heels, cause my skills are terrible
me laughing at men wearing heels better than I would ever do
just what i needed
I'd never thought heels can make one's feet bleed that much... They really are dagger pumps.
wow Eugene you look good in everything....
Eugene really toughed it out. He had the highest heels and he was very active and lasted till the end. Wow!
and women keep crying for equality when we bring this torture upon ourselves
Eugene went in when he was  dancing lmaoo
I need zach's heels in my life D:
I have Zac's shoes…...
Great Big Story is way better than your crap buzzfeed.
One day I went to a party and I wore a high heel of 6 cm the hole night. Observation: I'm 15 years old kkkk
I have the exact same ankle boots XD
All the Try Guys' hotness increased by 40% with heels, like dayummmm
I think that the buzz Feed guys are totally in the closet. and there spouse's cheat on their candy asses. I have seen way to many videos where they are doing woman like things to them selves. I honestly don't know how there women stay with them !
"make my mom and sisters proud" lmao
What are the "TryGuys"?
I need those black heels Zach had on in my life tho tbh
Who's Eugene?
I wanna wear stilettos because they're basically weapons for your feet. Ooooh, and then a little blade on the tip!

Everything I wear can murder you.
That moment when you realize a guy looks better in those high heels 👠 than you
that boi Eugene
Zacks little song 💖
Daaaaaamn Zach 👌👌👌
"welcome to the real world"?!! Seriously?! Wow Your real world is this?
How tall is zach?
Why a night, why not a day? Or a week?
Eugene looks hot no matter what he's wearing !
Oh Lord, they didn't break in the heel, brave men
I was expecting ugene to stab someone with his dagger heals
They smacked it 
I can't even wear heels properly and I'm a women 👏🏽😂😂
It gets easier overtime.
man down. MAN DOWN.
I LOST IT
like this hasnt been done before. how original!!
This video was so good. Everyone slayed. Made me smile and giggle, y'all looked godly despite the pain! 😘
LOOK AT EUGENE DANCING, LIKE DAMN.
How does Eugene dance like that in heels and normal
When Keith said "T-nails" I died 😂😂😂😂
Zach and Eugene killed it
Eugene's heels are impractical there should be a limit of high a heel can go
Shoutout to my mans Keith with the fiancé
I personally don't think heels look THAT good on males but I think Zachs boots with the heel are really wearable. He looks great in those!
did that guy really say "welcome to the real world" tho
I feel like Zach cheated. If this was supposed to be a competition, Eugene definitely won
I haven't seen this yet, but can only guess Eugene wins at this
Zach´s shoes are a lot of girls everyday shoes :D
lol
He doesn't like christmas?!
Oh you Eugene you have seriously underestimated how painful heels that high are...
I have worn 6 in heel before I can handle  it 😂👌
Zach had the right to go with a boot. In fact since heels were made for men just wearing heal boots would be fine for the guys to wear. They did look good though.
I myself am a larger person and I can't wear heels at at all. Once I loose weight you never know.
I really liked those ankle boot heels. They weren't to high either, three inches with a thick base? All good haha
This is bob 🦃    Bob can't swim.        SO DONT LET THIS COMMENT GET LOST IN THE COMMENT SEA🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃
"My toes are bleeding... but I look hot"
IVE.MISSED.THE.TRY.GUYS
ANYONE ELSE GET A PIERCE THE VEIL AD??
They should all wear shirts with Eugene's face on it saying "I'm hot you're not"
NEED FRIENDS LIKE THISSSS PLZZZ GOD PLZZZ 😂😭LOVE U TRY GUY❤❤❤❤
Try Louboutins! 🤕
Eugene is literally hot💖💖💖
ok serious question were do you get those shoes from because I am size 10 UK and finding hills that size is super hard
Ok but who else lost it at 'that tush is got the push?!'
who wore it better women or guys?
THEY LOOK SO GOOD!!! 😍😍😍
Eugene is always hot.
Omfg Eugene I cant even lmao
Zach's are probably really comfortable. Like that's an everyday type of shoe, at least for me lol.
Who loves Eugene even more?....✋🏻✋🏻✋🏻
I watch Buzzfeed Video for the Try Guys and Worth It. I watch Buzzfeed Blue for Buzzfeed Unsolved. That's the extent of my Buzzfeed experience
But I make these high heels work...
Zach looks so awesome in his I want his heels
HAHAHAHAHA THIS IS GOLD!
try guys are the best!😂👌🏼❤
I want to marry Zach he's so adorable
Zach's shoes are cute and i would prefer to wear those than the other ones
Ned looked hot tbh
Zach looked so good in those heels
I feel like every employer that requires women to wear heels at work needs to watch this video and try to wear heels themselves before they tell their employees they have to wear them. They really hurt!
Eugene's shirt at 8:34 😁
But we already knew Eugene was gonna slay
OMG Zach same. I'm already shorter than my friends and they all wanna wear heels during concerts making me like a midget cuz I choose flats over heels. 
Comfort over fashion!!!!
Zach has such a good fashion sense! He looks great!
I want eugenes shirt (the one with all their names)❤️
Taking off heels is like having a huge orgasm
The ankle boots are actually comfortable and easy to walk in that doesn't count
Zach could just wear those seriously and look good!
That was not just a car. It was a Rolls..
Dammmnnnn those ankle boots. Would totally wear these. Not painful at all (compared to stilettos or pumps)
I was so happy to hear Ned say "but does it make my butt look good?" XD
Speaking of which - I wore heels for 11 hours straight on a night out a few days ago. I had brought flats, but didn't give in. When I came home, I felt like I had reached the epitome of my potential in this world, and I am still living high on that pride
"I WAS HUNGRY" 

😂😂😂😂😂
Still walking better than me ( a 20 y.o female).
8:00 That moment zach almost gets ran over by a rolls-royce...
those heels LEGITIMATELY look good on Zach I'm impressed with the outfit cooridnation
those ankle boots are so cute. and the most sensible shoes out of the bunch
at least now they can respect women a bit more
i wanted to see Eugene's relaxing moment after 6 inches why did you have to cut it
zac is unbearable to watch. he's not funny and disgusting
Zach's boots are cute as hell. best shoe choice. I want a pair
Zach`s shoes were basically an everyday shoe for most women I know. They look really nice and comfortable actually :D
I'm a drag queen who LOVES heels, and I was just like " Oh that's cute " When I walk every weekend in my 9 inch heels for 8+ hours!
The best bit of my night is walking to the taxi, shoes in hand feeling the relief, not aware of the Mount Everest blisters that will appear in the morning
Ned's butt looks 10/10
EUGENE WAS AMAZING IN THIS VIDEO OH MY GODDDDD
Eugene is the girl I wouldn't talk to in a club.
Omg i love Zachs shoes😍
LOL "U CAN WATCH THE WHOLE THING AND PAY NOTHING" OMG
said it b4 I'll say it again you guys are HILARIOUSLY IDIOTIC!
"What advice do you have for us?"
"Don't."
Zach looks cute in boots :3
EUGENE YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE SKJDNDBD
Lmao at them walking down the steps 😂😂😂😂
don't let your kids watch this.
👠👠👠👠👠
I feel bad for everyone but Zack. As someone who lives in 2-3 inch ankle boots, I refuse to hear any complaints.
WHO WAS THA GIRL EUGENE WAS DANCING WITH (⊙.⊙(☉̃ₒ☉)⊙.⊙)
Zach and Eugene look lit af
Eugene is amazing.
What an as$hole who said Welcome to the real world. Just say sorry
I'm simple person. I see Eugene, I click.
oh heLL YES
"Who's that man walkin down the street with delicate feet? It's Zach." He's honestly adorable
"t'nails"
If this gets to 15 likes I'll buy you a nandos.
I can't even wear a freaking 1/2 wedge or whatever it's called without falling on my face
9:46 You see, a normal video would get flagged or something, I wonder if that would happen here...
I love Eugene's and Zach's heels but hate Ned's and Keith's. Only Eugene's are tall enough.
Is wearing heels the only way to prevent Eugene from walking away when they drink? Let's find out! 😂
I told the girls in my group that went to prom that they were being babies about the heels. They told me to try it that night. I did. I danced for 3 hours and I honestly can say my feet felt fine. I understand they hurt but I fell like some girls are a little overdramatic on how bad they are
One word to describe this:

'F A B U L O U S"
Zach's outfit was gorgeous, 10/10 would wear.
I sometimes wear 8+ inch platform heels for drag and honey walking home isn't fun in those a six inch is a bless
I already forgot...was it Eugene and Zach that were the perfect friends (from the BFF genetics vid)?
😀
04:21 TWP OF HEARTS TWO HEARTS THAT...
When Eugene dropped it low 😘😍🍑
Zach made the best choice for heels that wouldn't murder his feet
Zac's heels went really well with him tbh
Zach looks friggen great in heels
zach had the best choice
Fun fact: 
Men actually wore heals before women did back in history
Zach had a daytime bootie. Like come on man that's not a heel.
I have never wore heels out but I did got out once with brand new shoes... and I walked a lot so by the end of the day my feet were just bleeding but I didn't want to take them off because they were too cute 😂 the struggle is real
is anyone else really surprised they didn't make this a feminist thing about how society makes women were heels. props to them for just having a fun nonpolitical video for once.
When I can't dance half as good as eugene
Dramatic af
yas i love how they are breaking "gender rules"
Petition to normalise men wearing heels cuz they look HOT
or course Eugene picked the dagger heels.  of course
I want Eugene's heels so bad, but I also know I would wear them once and complain the whole time.
They're so gorgeous though.
Ariel kinda looks like Iskra Lawrence 😛
I'm only 15 and I'm killer in heals.... I'd last more than normal women 😂🤔
Eugene is the reason I still watch Buzzfeed
jealous of the girl Eugene danced with
I love Zach's shoes!
omg
Zachs heels were actually sensible and looked cute with his outfit
7:09 "He just stepped on my toe!" :) Aw
The dancing between that girl and Eugene is goals, that was so hot in so many ways.
Heals r soo comfortable 😂😂
eugene went all in and I'm happy for that
Eugene is so freaking extra
hey that's not fair. Zach got the easiest one
I've never seen anyone get down in heels like eugene did
If I'm going to wear heels out I'll wear a boot type, something with ankle support. I have 6in stiletto ankle boots and they don't hurt my feet, but other times I'll wear the dagger heels. Mostly I wear flats because I'm already so tall.
wise wise Zach
6:42 Aw, he kissed him!!
Am I the only one who thought that Zach looked really good in his heels?? Like he pulled it off super well
these euguene stans got to go
Zach must of listened to others about which heals to wear.

Also I feel like taking your heals off are better than taking your bra off.
gosh dang it Eugene 😂
Of course Eugene got the dagger pumps, the highest and most challenging of all their shoes!
i think zach wore his heels the wrong way
I love it when you guys try smthg that we girls do all the time and suffer through - so taken for granted! You guys understand now 😭
6:13 Yanis Marshall, is that you? :) ily
Eugene is a better girl than the girls at my school😂
High heels are bad for your feet.

Les talons sont mauvais pour vos pieds.
I feel like Eugene got into his drag persona when he wore the heels
0:03 honey, you'd look hot even wearing a Chewbacca costume.
I wish they had noted the fact that you should NEVER TAKE THE HEELS OFF AND PUT THEM BACK ON. It makes it feel SOOOOO much worse when you take them off for a little break. Sure that break is going to feel good, but the pain that happens when you put the shoes back ON???? My god
Does this mean ankle boots win with less pain?
lol what's next the try guys try gay sex.
Eugene I pity his feet so much. I can't even do 3inch let alone 6
ARIEL AND NED LINKING ARMS IS MY NEW RELIGION
zach should wear them heels regularly he look Fine 🔥
Eugene dancing with that girl thoooooooo
Haha now they know how us women feel.
Ned: "What advice do you have for us?"
Ariel: "Don't."
SHE KNOWS THE PAIN
They should wear high heels like this AND the boob weights for a day!!!!! That's when they know what we go through✌✌
I can run and jump in heels i feel offended
Zack's outfit with his heels was actually really cute and paired well with them. He looked good!!
Im a simple girl... i see Eugene... i click
Eugenes shoes are crazy, I would never wear those lol
I once went out wearing 9 inch heels and they started to hurt like crazy but I didn't want to take them off or walk funny so I just put up with it. The next morning when I woke up the middle part of my foot (the bit that arches in the heel)  had no feeling in it, and the feeling didn't come back for a month :(
5:28 Ned always reminds me of Rick Cosnett, or Eddie from "The Flash". I mean, look at their faces!
Zach is the only smart one, I couldn't walk in the other ones
they're all walking around looking like confused baby deer
😂
Hahah step ahead boys girls do it best ;)
Ankle boots are easy to wear, that's why I like them
EUGENE GOING ALL OUT ❤️
zach has the safest one, im a girl, not only i cant walk in heels... i cant walk in flats either.. i always trip over 'something'
Ah yes one of the struggles of being Pentecostal ✌️ we're basically all heel lovers and they kill out feet 💯❤🖤
One time I held out all night, 10pm to 5am and now every time I wake up in the morning, get out of bed and put my feet down on the floor, my nerves ache 😅😅 haven't been the same since haha
One time I held out all night, 10pm to 5am and now every time I wake up in the morning, get out of bed and put my feet down on the floor, my nerves ache 😅😅 haven't been the same since haha
2:32
you're welcome.
Possibly the best Try Guys ever.
I can image Eugene in a club dancing very clearly 😂😂
The worst mistake is taking off your heels in the middle of the night for a break. Your feet are swollen and its only that much harder to fit them back in the shoes without some fresh bouts of pain.
Holy crap Eugene at 2:30 unpause and watch this move omg
keith the tajin should be in the kitchen it s for cooking, it s not a decoration XD go make yummy food in it bro XD
YES MY TRY GUYS, I HAVE BEEN WAITING
"I may have made a terrible mistake...but I look hot." Haha!
Welcome to the real world
pls let's normalize this guys look so good in heels
if your heels are uncomfortable dont wear them??? i just wear comfortable heels
Katie's face at 00:17 is priceless
they didn't blur the faces of the guy(s) that walked past Ned 😂😂😂
I've never related more to a video than I do right now.
Eugene always rocks wearing girl outfits...he looks better than me and i'm a girl!

Mwah 💋
omg I would be feeling uncomfortable wearing heels all night
Of course Eugene has to wear something that looks hot and deadly. 😂
Zach's heels are very comfortable...
Did Eugene say "you're really hot" to that girl?? He's in the mood to flirt even in excruciating pain 😂
Eugene "I think I made a terrible mistake...but I look hot"  me😂
why is ned always worried about does his butt look good ??😂
You can see that they applied the advice from the video where they got professionally styled to their everyday life 😁 You all look great, but Zack is B A N G I N
Is it just me or were Eugene's heels a bit too big for him? Probably only added to the intense discomfort he would have felt anyway...
I never wear heels because I know they will ruin my night lmao
The calves must be burning
MAN DOWN. MAN DOWN. 

LMFAO!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Eugene does look sexy in those 'Daggers', but when doesn't he look hot?!?
Gah Daym  , the force of cringe is powerful in this one ..
They all look so good in heels!
Keith's toes are the same length as his gf's fingers...
I love the heels that Zack is wearing
Brendon's the only one that can make those high heels work
Zach looks the most unsteady and hes in the easyest ones i wear wedge boots and i love them! I race my friends to dairy queen when we walk downtown after school and i full out run and win!
I'm a woman and I hate heels. it's bad for you're body and ankle WOMAN please wear flat or just no shoes. this is my opinion so if you disagree it's also you're opinion I just want to say this because people don't understand
How tall is Zach?
i am taller than all them except for Eugene
As we all know, Eugene makes a better girl/woman than all of us
and that is why you buy foldable shoes to carry in your bag
Zach looks pretty good with those little booties haha
Must be weird seeing a bunch of grown men dancing in high heels
Poor Ned....
Wait guys I wear shoes that have like a 5 inch platform and a 7 inch heel and can last through like nine hours of dancing in them, my friends and I have tried. Am I just a superhuman? Probably.
im a girl and I can't even rock heels like Eugene 😂
I feel like most of the guys went safe but Eugene went all out
DAAAMMN EUGENE!! 👅
Zachs out fit. Matches perfectly
Mens used to wear heels and women use heels to look mascular.
u made this already with other guys.
Can we all agree that Eugene rocks everything he wears
ned is me on a restaurant tho
Please i´m from Venezuela and i need your help! If you share this on Facebook will be help enough and a little of your time
https://www.generosity.com/community-fundraising/please-help-us-in-our-hour-of-need-sos-venezuela/x/12553434
Eugene is always so extra I love it
3:34 i had to do a double take i thought his hand was deformed!
I like how Zach says (talking about himself and Eugene) "Only the hot ones are left" yet they are the only single ones in the group
Now I'm really curious as to how tall Zac is 🤔
Ned: What advice do you have for us? 
Ariel: Don't. 
Hands down best advice ever
eugene in six inch heels? HELL YEA
Eugene looks the hottest
"when you drink, it distracts you from the pain" -- motto of my life
Zach picked the easiest ones haha
But they have done this before ? I think....
everyone is talking about how hot is Eugene but can we just appreciate how bomb Zach's outfit with those boots look??
i mean dayum, I would wear that
Zach's look so comfy I want ten
Zach's booties are the most comfortable, I similar booties almost every day.
eugene could probably still look hot even when he wears actual rags tbh
I feel like Keith would make an AWESOME Venus Van Dam
the ankle boots weren't supposed to be that bad
Zack's the only one with nice, pretty, more practical footwear.
No matter how bad my feet hurt I try to wait it out until my calfs start cramping
"any advice?"
"Don't."
when Brendon and the try guys lose a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt. but they all make those  high heels work.
Zach looks adorable in heels
1:12 He's pulling a Jenna Marble with those very divided/stretched toes...definitely not like our Holosexual queen, Christine.
Why do all man go into this almost instinctive stance of bending at the knees? I'm crying. What so hard about walking, starting with straight legs, and then you bend slightly at the heel but you move at the hips, not the knees (meaning it's the hip that does most of the work). They look like chickens with wide legs, walking with their knees bent. I'm laughing so much xD
Eugene lasted longer in heels then my mom can last.
Zach was the only one who didn't flip out most the time.
Ned fell off his chair and face planted which was actually the best thing on the internet.
Keith..Keith just got taller and that's all I have to say.
Brads wife got fired on his birthday. 
#justiceforbradswife
booooyyyyy let me catch my son on high heels
Eugene x taco bell = yas
no shawarma???!?
"KFC! THERE, I SAID IT!"
Ned is obviously drunk but it's like he has the munchies😂
um, CHIC FIL A? lol
I... I don't like fried chicken
"You don't know that!" "Yes I do! Ronald's my neighbor!"-Eugene
this is hilarious
Zach is a happy little elf when he's drunk
"we can't eat Pizza Hut without sauce"
"Better people, papa johns......NEXT"
I'm in tears 😂😂😂😂 One of the best videos. I love to see the try guys drunk 😂😂
I honestly think this is my favorite try guys video
I want someone to talk about me like how Eugene talks about that taco.
When Keith got mad because there was no sauce I started crying😂😂😭
are they all gay? lol
You know Eugene is fucked when he starts showing emotion
1:59 omg is it me or does keith sound like bianca del rio here
I need to get drunk with these guys.
I am the person who wants to see that. 
I love Zach. I think he's so hot... shush
And people say only black people eat KFC.....ummm try again
Why did they pick Pizza Hut? At least get the best pizza place like Papa Johns or Dominoes!
Love them when they are not drunk,and love them even more when they are DRUNK!
i would kill a bear... for a KFC meal..........



#KFC4LIFE
I'm getting hungry watching this
Yeah Ronald's my neighbor
I love Eugene so much
Can we discuss what happened at 1:51 because it kills me wha Keith said
oh Ned hahahhaha
Doesn't seen whataburger

These people haven't lived yet.
Okay but tell me if I got a weird piece or something, but i had a bad experience with KFC... Because, I took a bite of it, and it was pure bone with a thin layer of literally only grease and batter. I cant explain it, it drizzled out just while oil with tiny chunks of fat. I tried to find the meat, but i only ran into bone and more of that weird grease thing.... literally im now a vegan.
I want to get drunk with all of them now. Especially Eugene, and Keith. I would have the time of my life!

3:52 Keith had me in years. Whatarewedoing? it literally sounded like that lmfao
this is a try guy shoot on acid
WHAT ARE WE DOING?!?! WHAT ARE WE DOING?!?!
Hilirious
This is one of the best videos i have ever watched 😂😂😂😂
I like them drunk:)
"No one wants to see that Zach" stares at Zach's butt for a little too long
OH sweet! KY REPRESENT!~ Keith likes my states food.
"Oh my gawd. OH MY GAWD." 😂
McDonalds and Burger king has nothing on Hesburger. If u ever get the chance to eat those babies, take it.
Y'all bugging 😂 KFC nasty
I got drunk and ate like 6 tacos locos it was bad
Eugene is just so hilarious in this video.
Make a part two, watching drunk people eat is sooo entertaining.
Eugene: I want the taco bell
covers mouth oh my gosh sjxhhdidjd
oh my god ned hahahahh
I'm just sitting here shipping Zach and Eugene sooooo hard
Ned and keith
Zach: do you think it would taste good if we combined them?
Eugene and Keith try it
Keith: no that's terrible, that was a bad decision. Even a drunk person knows that's bad. yuck yuck yuck yuck ew.
Any one else pee at the side of the toilet so it doesn't make any noise.
Popeyes is way better than KFC in my opinion
keith: I normally don't support the monarchy
Me: blending up the I made america script and pouring it over my naked body
Can we have Sober try guys reacting to this video?
Keith got so emotional over the fried chicken X'D
I wish someone loved me as much as Keith loves fried chicken
why two men, eating 1 chicken at same time? i'm worried.
I wonder if they remember shooting this video. If not, can we have them react to it?
"But the burger hamburger at the whopper king place" 😂😂😂
Only liked this bc of Eugenes reaction to the taco from Taco Bell
Lord of the fries... missed opportunity, Keith.
Frame broiled 😂😂😂
Okay so what I've gathered from the video:
-Drunk Keith yells a lot 
-Drunk Eugene talks more than normal 
-Drunk Ned is plain silly
-Drunk Zach looks like he is gonna cry 😂
THIS IS THE BEST TRY GUYS VIDEO EVER
3:51 me in exams
Drunk Keith is me all the time...
4:54 all transgenders need to go to KFC
Eugene was so shocked he liked taco bell while drunk omfg
this was amazingggggggg
i'm probably one of the few people in this world who hates KFC. never liked the taste of their food. Popeye's is much better in my opinion.
3:51 - Me when I think about politics in America. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
What other job do you get to be drunk for 😂
Eugene acts like a thirteen year old when he's drunk I love it
Quotes (pt two):

"I don't see the Doritos in this?"
-Ned

"Yes I think KFC was incredible, There I said it! It blew my brain apart!!!"
-Keith

"I could eat a whole pizza drunk by myself. I HAVE eaten whole pizzas drunk by myself!"
-Eugene

"Do you think that Ronald McDonald paints his WHOLE body?"
-Zack
keith has the biggest mouth on youtube
KFC taste like onions on the skin
burger king
when eugene said i hate taco bell i died inside aaahhhhh
Go to work get drunk and eat food best job ever!!!
Keith is having a saucy melt down while Eugene is just getting on with it👌😍
ned trying the burgers gave me life
zach lalala face and voice hahahaha

At 3:51 Kieth is me in math! 😂
i love Zach when hes drunk
I CRACKED UP WHEN KEITH STARTED SHOUTING ABOUT CHICKEN
If they love Taco Bell, they should try Mexican tacos😍👅
I laughed so hard I almost cried 😂😂😂
olivia newton john travolta
I died when Ned was shoving the taco in and out of the paper thing
theyre all so giggly and excitable when drunk and its the only reason im alive
What we learned to day Ned can not speak when he is drunk
"The burger hamburger at the whopper king place."
the try guys look like that they'd  be like  be gone from me I'm on YouTube I'm higher then you common people
la la la best part
zach is so cute wtf
Drunk eating Taco Bell while watching this video
so wasted
I love how Eugene's accent changes almost every time he speaks😂😂
drunk ned is my favorite
Watching this stoned xD
Zach is so cute when he's drunk
Hey Eugene, get drunk with me.
i love them <3
Omg i love ned so much this is hilariouss
inaudible crying
Ned and Zach are my favorite😂
I'm crying😂😂
There so crazy in normal life, they don't really seem different apart from Eugene
drunk Try Guys is the best thing on this planet
lalala
idk why but I died when he made the Papa John's reference lol
Zach is an adorable cutie pie and I wanna sit on his face
Make a video of them not shaving for a week. I wanna see them with stubbles.
Pizza Hut is the best while I'm drunk.
la la la
There's a lot of gays at buzzfeed lol
I guess eugine is the boss😂
I don't know if it's just me but I can't stand any of these morons.
Is it just me or do they act more Gay when the are drunk. Lol
I need more Keith
3:52 I'm dead😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😅😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅
Wtf I love this!!
Actual mexican tacos are like 10000x times better than Taco Bell
Did Ned not mention his wife???!!!
Oh man they are all so funny drunk :D I've watched this video so many times already!
Zach is the cutest when he is drunk
"Until I've been drunk"
popeyes was definitely better lol
Who else got hungry watching this video? ;-;
"Everyone loves fried chicken." I...I don't... Also is it weird that I was eating pizza while watching this?
"Put me a bathtub full of bifscuits"
keith said taco bell cant win without sauce. TRUTH
Am I just a big winner ? Everybody's a winner lol
kfc ftw
😂😂😂😂❤
Watching them do that drunk made me laugh so hard my parents thought I was literally dying. Eugene is my favorute thou in all honesty.
True confession: I come back and watch this at least once a day - usually more. It's just so damn funny!
Why did they give Ned's burger vote to McDonald's? He only preferred the fries. He liked the Burger King burger better.
When he says "I can eat a whole pizza" I thought a pizza was one serving :(

I've eaten 2 on occasion
Who else thought it was so cute when Zach was singing 'la la la'??
keith 😂😂 omg I laugh so hard omg😂
They are so funny especially drunk😂
these guys are making so happy
Better sauce better seasoning better people papa jonhs
Well it's not like they're actually much different...
4:29 (Ned's Face) That face you make when you discover how babies are made.
They're all so beautiful when drunk
they dont seem drunk 0_0
the real challenge will be on the toilet
I never eaten a taco
From buzz feed I probably like the try guys the most cause they are ok with swearing.
"It blew my brain apart" i died😂😂😂
0:58

NED YOU HAVE A WIFE!!!
wait...did Ned not mention his wife....
Everyone check out my best friend channel!!! Her name is Izzy 193 she want me to give as many shoutouts as possible!
I hate KFC, the skin is so soggy all the time ;-;
Drunk eugene reminds me of markiplier
Wendy's win
watching them eat is making me hungry!!!!!
Are they drunk or high
Keith is my favorite person ever
I feel like Eugene is not that drunk, maybe he has a high tolerance towards alcohol
BuzzFeedVideo Ned is so funny when he's drunk, but he keeps talking about his wife in other videos, which is irritating.
Is it normal that I don't get drunk even after 6 shots of vodka ???     I even used a breathalyzer test.
4:13 zach is literately me omfg 😂
Were they drunk or on methamphetamine?
"but the burgerhamburger et the whopper king place... ekmeph." 1:33
Oh my god I'm dying of laughter xD keep doing what you do try guys <3
I cannot drunk eat, it makes me sick.  Even if I eat before there's a serious limit to how much I can eat versus drink once I start drinking.  I can down a lot, but my stomach doesn't want layers, it's starts this reaction that's bad where the alcohol rejects any real meal following its consumption.  It's like a club that says so many guys are in, but at a certain point it only wants ladies... no more guys invited in killing the buzz for those original guys.  XD
3:49
Even the idea is drunk.
Round 1: Burger vs Burger.
Round 2: Fried Chicken vs Fried Chicken
Round 3: Pizza vs . . . Taco?. . .
Wah?
True mcdonalds fries are bomb but the whopper is where it is at
Keith oml so funny
lol this is amazing
4:14 😂😂
"I didn't realize Big Macs were so pickley until I've been druuunk" - Eugene
i want to meet zack
KFC over Popeyes's any day
The part when they try Taco Bell was exactly the same reaction I had when I tried the dorito taco
"No one wants to see you , Zack"
Well apparently you do, Eugene 😂 wink wink
Drunk Keith is the best lol
ZACH IS SO CUTE...I LOVE HIM!! 😍😂😣
2.7 million views  I love the try guys
I love when zach giggles!!!!
I'm not a big fan of Fried chicken
3:48 is me everytime I have taco bell and my friends forget the hot-hot sauce.

"DONT TOUCH ME MAN, YOU HAVE LOST MY TRUST, YOU GET NOTHING BUT SADNESS. MAY GOD FORGIVE YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE."
This is the funniest videos of THE try guys. Keith and Eugene just make it even funnier at the end.
"Final verdict the fries at mcdonalds are better but the burger [burp] hamburger at the whopperking [laughing]" I LOVE THEM
I love Zach's laugh soooo much. lol
Lol "they both come in a box"
LOL they are so much funnier drunk
is there cheffette
I wanna be a Try Guy/Girl, but then I remembered I'm like 10 years younger than them all ;-;
#getzachpapajohns
EUGENE REFRENCED GREASE HE NOW HAS MY HEART!
Omg I'm laughing so hard hahahahahhahaha 
Eugene cried because of a TacoBell!!!! Hahahahah I'm so done
Sooo much cattier and sassier drunk. Flippin hilarious.
What do drunks vegans eat? 
Their tears of jealousy?
Favorite drunk Try Guy? For me it's a toss-up between Zach and Keith. They are both such happy drunks.
Lol I love eugene when he said "I would eat taco Bell Drunk"  like a teenager saying their crush lol
chicken cool ranch taco (sober or drunk)...
"LA LA LA!" Legit my favorite part 😂😂
I love you all equally
taco bell drunk is the greatest
This. Editing. Gold.
Why did zach switch from eugene to keith?
Wait... So does this mean that nobody else gets waffles when they're drunk? I swear waffles are the TRUE Beat Drunk Food. Please try it!
this was so amazingly funny I love it sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sooo so much, and when kieth was like 'what are we doing' when there was no source it killed me
"LA LA LA..."
Do a HIGH food test!!!
This is my favorite video of all time
POPEYE ALL DAY! KFC doesn't even taste like chicken.
Drunk Ned laughing at his own jokes is my spirit animal
Mine will be burger king and toca bell
I couldn't stop laughing when Eugene started crying about the fact that he would eat taco bell drunk
What a whopper of a video!
Ned is great in this video. Everything about this makes me laugh so hard. I swear they're a lot more like me and my friends when they're drunk 😂
Pizza should be against pizza
I love them
LA LA LA 😂😂😂😂
The problem with their reviews is they never come to any sort of decisive decision on what is best. Everyone just disagrees and that makes the review pretty useless.
Are the guys gay 😂
The editing on this video is the best.
What are we doing!!
LA LA LA~
I like how Eugene, the coolest, sexiest guy on the planet, is the least cool out of all the Try Guys when drunk.
what I got from the end of the video. you have no friends your life is miserable
im at the pizza hut! I'm at the taco bell! I'm at the combination pizza hut and taco bell!
Bojangles beats KFC and Popeyes all day everyday.
People get 20× funnier when thier drank
"it was just a stray piece of lettuce" IM LAUGHING
La La La...PAPA JOHN'S!!!
Where is the Try Guys try a 4 man orgy episode? This was close to that.
Make another one
zacks drunk laugh is so cute im crying
I CAN'T TELL IF THEY'RE DRUNK OR NORMAL XD
There is no arguing about that Keith LOVES KFC Fried Chicken, here's proof: 4:51. I like it too but here in Finland we don't have KFC's which is sad IMO.
PAPA bless
THIS IS SO HILARIOUS
to be honest now that im sober i dont remember typing those comments and now that in sober pest ffr is kfc even tho u need water and soda afterwards
Doritos locos taco is he only thing I EVER get at Taco Bell, sadly I go there too often
Zach and Eugene is  my brotp
I'm just laughing
they almost kissed
I wish I could get drunk with the try guys!!!
4:12 lol
Eugene: I would eat Taco Bell drunk [crying softly]
I have never laughed so hard in my life.
I watched this at 2am. and afterwards, went to the kfc website and jus looked at the menu until I fell asleep.
drunk Zach seems so innocent 😇
Are all these guys gay?
This might sound crazy, but I think Keith looks like the crab from Moana.
I want a Eugene.
Everyone knows whataburger is the best drunk spot
Eugene drunkenly crying about Taco Bell is one of the best things that happened in drunk video
i think this is my favourite version on these guys XD
'Don't eat without me you motherfucke-' -Eugene
I've never related more XD
Keith talking about fried chicken is me
Eugene: Peppery?! 
whilst looking insulted
I feel like this video was edited by a drunk person too...
I laughed so hard my face turned red!
PLEASE DO MORE DRUNK TRY GUYS
Now I'm hungry... I'm on an overnight plane flight.
Zach crying about how delicious the food is and Eugene crying when he discovered he loves taco bell is me. Just.... same.
I'm drunk right now and am REALLY JEALOUS!!!!
I need more videos like this in my life xD
The try guys should just be drunk in every video, this is so freaking funny 😂
dude Keith and Zach's giggles omg
KEITH AND FRIED CHICKEN HAS ME IN TEARS
Eugene said "i don't like Taco Bell" WHAT IS WRONG WITH UUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but he is still my favorite
Ned is such a cutie!!!

Also watching this when drunk is hilarious heheheh
Oh my god. Ned didn't mention his wife :O
they both come in a box
Church's chicken the best la la la
" you don't know that ?!"   " Yes I do Roalds my neighbour"
Previously on the try guys...
WHICH ONE IS THAT ONE I WANT TO SEE THAT ONE
I can eat a whole pizza drunk by myself I have eaten a whole pizza drunk by myself
GAYyyy
ALL OF THE PAPA JOHNS REFERENCES WERE KILLING MEEEEE😂😂😂😂😂
better sauce, better burgers, papa johns😂😂
Buzzfeed was cool until they went libtard.
I haven't laughed so much in a while. That was the best.
Came from the new video and I correct myself now I've never laughed so hard
i think drunk keith just stops caring and it's beautiful
i'm dying HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHA
everything eugene at 5:00 HAHAHAHAHA
ya ronald's my neighbor
KFC won because, when your drunk, nothing tastes better than a whole mess of MSG!
Keith was so funny I was dying with laughter                             "Papa Johns"  Keith 2017
la la la
They obviously didn't try spicy Popeyes.  Lefties do everything wrong.
i feel like alcohol just aMpLifiEs zach's adorableness
I love the editing in this video! Also, you guys should get drunk on camera more!
lol LA LA la
"lalala"
Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
Louisiana just got rekt right there
Ned was so fucked up
Who else thinks that the try guys should make slime?
Dorito locos <3
they need to be drunk more😂😂😂
are the try guys gay??
This made me so hungry 😂
A REALLY subtle Papa John's sponsorship
This is HANDS DOWN the best Try Guys video ever
"Well f*ck me and call me an uncle's donkey" -Eugene, 2017
Ned & Keith drunk are so sensual towards each other xD
Wow burgers in America look way bigger and better than the ones in my country
LA LA LA
Eugene would eat Taco Bell and cry while he's drunk, because his brain can't accept the fact that he likes Taco Bell, drunk.
Popeyes > KFC all day everyday
"Don't eat with out me Mother freaker."
"I ate a piece of stray lettuce..."

"You don't know that!"
"Yes I do. Ronald's my neighbor." 

GET EUGENE
 DRUNK MORE HAHAH
this is me everyday! "OMFG THIS IS SO GOOD! FRIED CHICKEN YEAH!"
You do not know the best drunk burger until you have tried whataburger
everything about this video was superb
really annoying people.
The nacho flavor taco is better than cool ranch!
I've never seen a drunk guy eat salad before. 🥗
3:51 literally me when I get drive thru and they don't put any sauce on the side
I would love a night out on the drink with Keith 😂😂😂
Oh my gosh I love them
When i get drunk i cant really taste anything and it pisses me off.
"do we have any sauce" sees there's no sauce confused face "what are we doing!!! what are we doing"  lowers head in shame  "this fight is over we can't beat pizza hut without sauce"😭😭💀💀💀
Eugene was so cute when he tried the Taco Bell 😂😂😂
I'm inclined to believe KFC paid the Try Guys. Their chicken is not better than Popeyes!
oh my god. Zach is so cute.
This honestly made me feel sick watching 😂
The papa johns part killed me lmao
They would be fun to hang out with drunk
Them drunk is actually the best
If you think KFC is better than Popeyes you need to kill yourself.
I feel like they're more than drunk...I feel like they're drunk & high off of something as well..
Would they taste better if you combined them? You can refer to a Shane Dawson video for that lol
I love how they act pretty much the same drunk as when they are normal
ZACH IS SUCH A CUTE LITTLE MAN CHILD OMG I CAN NOT.
Ned : 'I don't see any Dorito's in here?'
Zach : literally genuinely checks the taco
Also Zach : 'wh..what do you mean? The whole thing is the Dorito?'
😂😂
Of course they would think KFC is better than Popeyes
i love the $5 box 💕😱
I love drunk try guys 😂
The Try Guys are funny when they're drunk xD
OMG is Eugene okay?  😂😂😂😂
These aren't tacos, f*ck taco hell
Zack's cute lil' butt!
Lamb donner kebab would beat all of this
One of the best Try Guys videos! Half the time they didn't even make sense 😂😂😂
i would go to fry lord
I've never had tacobell, it's not where I live
holy fuckrooni that was hilarious
Gosh....really needed this video. Thank you Try Guys!
3:50 yessssss
I bet u never guessed papa John was from indiana
Ned's killing it!!
"And if you have enough friends you can eat all of this"
Please! You can just give me my bedroom, doors locked lights off, and some Netflix, that'll all be gone in 5 minutes 😂.
Yesterday I found a piece of hair in my whopper
The two reasons I love this video bc it's funny and drunk Keith And Zack remind me of my best friend deanna and I sober
I don't need "friends" to eat it all, nor do I need to be drunk. I just have to be on my period.
when Keith found out there wasn't sauce 😂😂😂
you can't have taco bell vs pizza hut. it's the same chain! DO-OVER! ;)
The thumbnail looks like Filthy Frank.

The Burger King where I live is always trash.
whoever edited this video deserves an award or something
McDonald fries are just addictive
Taco bell is a diarhhea dice roll? Maybe with some loaded dice :D
Faggets
This is the closest that we will see them kissing 😂😂😂
Would it Have hurt to do pizza hut vs dominoes and Taco bell vs del Taco?
Shoulda been Taco Bell vs deltaco
OMG i think this has been my favorite video of buzzfeed by far!! Love the try guys and they are even funnier drunk and eating their favorite foods :D
I can not stop laughing. I also cant believe they haven't had the cool ranch taco.
1:46 papa bless 🙏
Best video I've ever seen.
Something tells me they got sponsored
If they're all willing to get high I'd watch the hell out of this
1:34 McDonald's has better fries? I just lost all respect for you...
They've never had Doritos lokos?
keith is abnormaly attractive to me
Its definitely popeyes.
I love Eugene's reaction to Taco Bell
Burger King, KFC (only in Ky), neither I'd rather have Papa John's.
Let's see them trying out Aquavit!
Keith's face at 2:25
3:50 intern WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHEREW THE SAUCe?
Better burgers... Better fries... Better people... PAPA JOHNS
Guys... there were no mentions of Ned's wife in this video...
"I would not eat this sober" lmaooooooooo
best buzzfeed video ever
it's just me or drunk Eugene is a little gay hahahaha i love it!
More like try too hard guys, amirite?
sodomite vibes
BuzzFeed, the only job where you're required to be drunk...
... D,: WAA ARE WE DOING!!?!
That grease revelation tho xD
Keith's reaction to finding out there was no taco bell hot sauce had me dying 😂
WATCHING THIS FOR THE NTH TIME!! I STILL CAN'T STOP LAUGHING 😂
damn it was hot when they both took a bite of the burger at the same time
incorporate more alcohol into buzzfeed content. More specifically,,,, incorporate more alcohol into keith's body
Love the editing on this video XD it's the best!
I didn't read drunk in the title and I was so confused and laughing thinking what are they on
They are not drunk, they are high, very very high lol.
There is someone who likes fried chicken more than Keith, Onew and Kai....yup
They are all so gay
"That's ludicrous" AWWWW ZACH IS USING BIG WORDS
This is why being drunk can help you find out if you've been cheated on
I wish someone could talk about me the same way Keith talks about Taco bell.
"It's like Olivia Newton John Travolta  all over my hands "
Ok so I need to get drunk to really eat my school food?
watch eugene at 4:21-4:24
Thoughts: Zach is the most adorable drunk ever. Additionally, "Ronald's my neighbor" omg.
I lost is when he said "better sauce better burger papa johns"
😂🤣
EUGENE WAS CRYING OMFG
This is one of my favorites videos!!! XD
KFC
Taco bell same company same good taste
Try Guys when drunk
Keith: Crazy and hilarious 
Zach: Awkward 
Eugene: More talkative than normal
Ned: Hyper (More so than usual)
Sold out.
Zach and Keith are truly hilarious when they're drunk 😂
I wish someone loved me the way these guys love taco bell
This was amazing!!!
1:58 cat in the hat?
3:49 "WHAT ARE WE DOING?"
The try guys should try 'Arnis' 😄💙
How could they not include Jack in the Box?!? That's always my go-to drunk food.
3:51-3:55 KEITH!!! "Whaaaat are we doing? What are we doing?" 😂😂😂😂
KEITH IS A BLESSING! HAHAHAHAHA
It should've been Taco Bell vs jack in the box, and little Cesar's vs Pizza Hut
who realized they switched partners lol
eugene!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When Eugene was so surprised about Taco Bell..  I almost lost it.. and Also.. Keith.. "Lalala" 😂😂😂
this is my favourite episode by far
Some people say 'Bob's your uncle'. Now, I say 'Ronald's my neighbor'. Thx Eugene
your wife is not gonna be happy wi th those bites man😂
Who else is also drunk watching this?
God. Watching this video while you're drunk is great.
Eugene acts like a gay dude when he's drunk lmao
My mom once bought 4 boxes of pizzas for my birthday and the next day, they were all gone. It turns out my cousin came home drunk and ate all of it.
fast good tastes so good f
Keith my dude we need to get drunk together
How didn't Ned knock over that glass at 3:34
The try guys should take a road trip all together in the same car and see how long it takes for them to drive each other crazy and stop at like San Francisco, Portland, Olympia, and Seattle. Then they should hold fan meet and greets. Like if you agree
FUNNIEST TRY GUY VIDEO EVER!
"fc Kfc it was so good my D is gone!"
Drunk Try Guys give me life.
y'all should see how many blazing hot wings the try guys can eat sober then how many they can eat drunk
Well that's great 
Buzz feed made this video with $83 and going to get over $200 from it...
Great job guys
... Also thank you try guys
Popeyes all day
"Yes I do Ronalds my neighbor!"
3:55 💀💀 "what r we doing?!"
"Do we have any sauce?" "No" "WHAT ARE WE DOING?!" Keith-2017

These guys get drunk and eat all day to get payed, Meanwhile I'm here working at these fast food restaurants to afford college.....
The try guys try making diy slime
I wrote a blog post a while ago about why i hate Try Guys, because this is what it does, it appeals to the male fantasy.






kek
"When the Try Guys try to sound clever" is the name of every episode ever.
what the heck?? just when i think eugene cant get any cuter, gets drunk and flushed and starts talking adorably and whispery. Lol also... ned. LOL
LALALA OMG I LOVE ZACHH HOW CAN A HUMAN BE SO ADORABLE AKJSGFSAJKGFLASGFA
Maybe they went to a kfc but i hate kfc that i have here. I rather go to popeyes.
Why does everybody feel like a homo when drunk?
The try guys are the reason buzzfeed is stil a thing...
"la la la" ahaha i can't😂😂😭😂😂

Hot dog, cream cheese, caramelized onions, hot sauce

I hate you so much right now. I just went on a diet.
Pizza is the BEST drunk food no doubt about it
Eugene crying over Taco Bell...
you should try 'tacos al pastor'. Wuuuu! they're the best when you're drunk
Imagine Ned and Keith every time they eat together they do it Lady and the Tramp style
Eugene and zac should get more screen time together
3:49 when your friends don't have the nacho dip...but not the nachos

I'm at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
Was the person that filmed this drunk as well? This is a mess of a video. A+++++
They are so me when im drunk xD
I lose a little respect for anybody who thinks KFC > Popeyes. KFC is BARELY better than Arby's. It can't even begin to touch Popeyes
People guess if it's a dog product or a baby product. Pls make that a thing😂😭
The Try Guys Drunk Fast Food Taste Test... say it 5 times fast -.-
Bunch o flaming homos.

when i forgot to ask for sauce at mac 3:47
Keith: WE HAVE NO SAUCE.."TRIGGERDD"
KFC"I think they got drunk over chicken 😂
Burger King, KFC, Taco Bell hands down win. Sober OR drunk.
Ned- Better fries. Better burger. Papa Joh- wheezes
Zach- Better quality chicken. Better seasoning... giggles Papa Johns
More of these please god
I swear this promotes people being drunk.
why not do dominoes vs pizza hut or pappa johns? why do tacos vs pizza?
What does kcf mean
I think Eugene become a little more bad boy than normal.

But I also think, Buzzfeed should make more of these (drunk-version) videos
Iol
WHAT ARE WE DOING?-- WHAAAT ARE WE DOING?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA BY FAR MY FAVORITE TRY GUYS VIDEO!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA EVERYONE's SO FUNNY 😂😂
"It's like Olivia Newton John Travolta all over my hands" 😂😂
KEITH!!!! HAHAHAHAHHAA
KENTUCKY IS THE BESTTTTT
Has anyone heard the "Combination Pizza Hut & Taco Bell" song? This reminded me of that.
Love drunk Keith and Zach together
Guys, I'm 1:44 into this video and Ned hasn't mentioned his wife or that he's married. This has to be a record
"Just put me in a bathtub full of biscuits."

Watching gay fuckers eat while drunk. that should be the tittle. -_-

When kieth is drunk he's Jerry Seinfeld
I laughed for 10 minutes at every time he said Papa Johns and I'm not even drunk. 😂😭
Try guys try Kendo!
Ronald is my neighbour lol
Ned and Eugene are my spirit animal
Oh I hate KFC and burger king
So the lesson here is KFC is only good if you are completely shitfaced.
making me hungry..... good job try guys.
I just love the devastated look on Keith's face when he was told they had no sauce for Taco Bell.
One of the guys reminds me so much of Nice Peter from ERB
taco bell is the best who else can't live without taco bell 👌👍❤😵
I felt drunk watching this 😂
"Brugers are better at the whopper king place"
- Ned 2017

Hey buzzfeed, you do know deaf people exist? Why does it take you longer to add subtitles to your videos over channels which have less subscribes such as oh whats inside?
IM GONNA SCREAM KEITH IS GOL D

THE LOOK OF UTTER DESPAIR AND SHOCK WHEN HE FINDS THERE IS NO SAUSE FOR HIS COOL RANCH TACO
this is so funny

Keith was so funny in this video
'I have fries between my leg' XD
Eugene - inaudiable crying
I believe his brain just blew into tiny shards
I'm at that Pizza Hut! I'm at that Taco Bell! I'm at that combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell!
this is so funny
'What are we doing? What are we doing?' LOL 3:50
I'm starving now
Keith is a beautiful soul that needs to not be reckoned with. XD
Keith and Zach have slowly become my favorite people on the face of the earth
I've never seen a Popeye's or a Taco Bell
These guys definitely fucked each other after the video ended #facts
"it's like Olivia Newton John Travolta all over my hands... wait, their names combine! did they do that on purpose?!"

lol Eugene is my favorite.
SOOO FUNNNY I LOVE THEM OMG😂😂😂😂
It's ok Zach, I want to see that.
I am Eugene at 4:09
Am I the only one who hates KFC?
https://www.buzzfeed.com/collegemarketers/tell-us-your-favorite-drunk-foods-and-well-guess-2w99k?utm_term=.indarMK5Dy#.uyg9j6W8yk
La la la~ 😂
Olivia Newton John Travolta😂
I loooove how this made eugene act more free and natural :) He always looked like he was giving himself too much pressure
3:50




Repeat x 15
ME, Myself & I - See, I have enough friends :D Imma eat all!
Zach and Eugene are kind of cute together?
I haven't laughed this much in months.  GREAT JOB!
Is it just me or is Eugene much much much for fun to watch when he's drunk lmaoooo

I love this so much
Am I the only one that thinks Eugene is hot? Yeah.. ok.
Get White Castle next time.
I love this collection of people like o man they have such a great dynamic
What is Keith saying from 2:27 - 2:33
3:52 i was in tears
im in college, broke af, and watching this is making me want to kill myself
Eugene is hawt cause he is cute anime asian boy and i wanna lick his butt while doing hentai
Eugene is adorable drunk
The try guys should try ariel. (silks, lyra, and hammock.) I'm in ariel and it's a lot harder than it looks. I would be so happy if the try guys decided to challenge themselves to do some tricks. If you guys decide to do this then good luck lol.
Does Eugene seem bigger than the others?  Eugene and Zach make a good couple...
Can you guys try Figure Ice Skating and/or Olympic Gymnastics? That would be great!
I'd rather have the pizza.
Watching drunk people is only funny when you are also drunk. I am not, so this isn't funny.
PAPA BLESS!!
sauce for burger king sucks I love mcdonalds
THE 'LALALA' PART MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD OMG
these guys got PAID to get drunk AND eat fast food. jealous af
Gay af
Zach is adorable
after 4:10 the backg music has me laughing so hard
They should get proper hammered instead of just tipsy. I wouldn't call that drunk.
so like do they drive these men home after this....?
4:55 thanks?!?!
Keith, moment 3:55 THANKS
thanks for the 2min moment Keith
Cold pizza when your drunk is the best.

3:19 "NOOO NOO" IM CRYING I LOVE THEM
I want them to do more of these
3:50 me right there when i don't get hot sauce
McDonalds is vomitous in every way. No meat in their burgers, no dairy product of any kind in their milkshakes, and their fries are limp, tasteless, and usually cold.
It took me longer than 5 minutes to finish the video due to me replaying certain parts gosh dangit😂
Hi everyone, I am currently writing my final research paper for my undergraduate degree and need your help. If you are 18 or older I would love for you to take my survey. It's anonymous so no need to worry about how you answer! Thanks so much! Its about how willingness to communicate and intercultural relationships are related.

https://utk.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6SyLfeEXWutby9n
I'm surprised Ned didn't mention his wife in this video
I wish Australia had taco bell
Next: The Try Guys High Food Taste Test!!!
i am drunk keith
I literally choked on water when Eugene started 'crying'
Eugene you won't like Taco Bell when you are sober.
And this is why every person who works for buzzfeed isn't human
At 3:51 
Is my fav part btw but what's the song in the background I want to know what song or thingy that is
When keith gets so upset over no sauce with rhe tacos LOL
i love this
the Papa John's part got me 😂😂😂
um?????
This was exhausting but beautiful
😂😂😂💕
I haven't had tacos for like 2 years now
Do we have any sauce? (no) WHAT ARE WE DOING !! 😂 so damn relatable
KFC VS Popeyes??? How the hell do you pick KFC...
shouldn't it be pizza hut and dominos o.O
#papabless
ey! Popeyes!

gay people pretending to be drunk
This is literally one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I was DYING the whole time.
This made me laugh so hard

Oh my goh
this is the best try guys video, or close to the best
I swear to god buzzfeed why are you so annoyingly entertaining? I mean like they're videos are so simple they have like no content to them its just reaction videos
this isn't papa johns!! it's pizza hut!
They should come to buffalo and try mighty taco vs taco bell
If you have enough friends you Can have all of these
lalala
Pizza hut or Taco Bell is one of the toughest questions, Not only are they completely different, They're two of my most favorite fast food joints.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I CANT STOP LAUGHING OH GOSH
I'm actually so hungry rn
KFC will never be better than Popeyes. EVER.
mad mad motherf&ckers. God Save the World.
BABY WHEN I TELL YOU POPEYES GON BLESS YO SOUL THESE BISCUITS AAAAAAAA
If I filmed anything while being drunk I would have to put every friend's phone on fire let alone put it on internet.
Pizza Hut vs Dominoes 
Taco Bell vs Del Taco 
Makes more sense to me at least
best buzzfeed video I've ever watched
You know they're drunk when they start saying KFC chicken is good
KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut all owned by the same company lol
i know buzzfeed cant respond to any comments but i think you guys should make a video of drunk people getting massages or do a worth it video of it please
I didn't mind seeing Zach's tush! (I do not need to see more but it was cute!)
Jack in the box tacos r the best
Forever my favorite try guys video
They need to come to ACTUAL Kentucky and taste kfc
drunk Keith and Zach are sooooo adorable
Can't relate
Honestly this is me sober
KFC is awful. It needs to be Popeye's vs. Church's.
I wanted to see that, Zack
they just had to pit my favorite pizza place ever and my fave fast food place ever, taco bell and pizza hut, I wouldn't be able to choose!!!
I too did not realize how pickle heavy a Big Mac is until I was drunk
eugene turns into keith when he's drunk
I AM KEITH IN FRIED CHICKEN OMG 😂😂😂😂 I AM EVERYONE IN FRIED CHICKEN
Try guys read hate comments pls x
why does Ned sound like Yoda and Kermit the frog combined
even a drunk person knows thats bad hahahahaha
From all the fast food, which one was the best?

Papa John's. la, la, la.
😂
The Try Guys drunk gives me life.
Papa bless
I love Drunk Eugene
You guys need to actually put Taco Bell up to Taco John's. I believe they're only here in the Midwest but they are sooooooooooo much better omfg. Delish!
I work at Kfc and the fact that they all liked the seasoning makes my heart sing.LALALALALAAALA. lol
I love them drunk
Ok why does ned look like my psychiatrist i swear hes living a double life
jack in the box taco >>> taco bell taco
2:07-2:08 lmaooo Zach was possessed by the Lumpy Space Princes
i do this taste test every saturday night...for...research
Ned is killin' me.
I want to hang out with drunk Eugene and Keith
How the hell did they get Eugene drunk..?
KFC IS THE BEST
Great food video
Wendy's for burgers McDonalds for fries and Coke and burger king for air. xD Taco bell over pizza hut and KFC for life over Popeye's!
They are amazing when they're drunk
I LOVE THE TRY GUYS EVEN MORE WHEN THEY'RE DRUNK OMG
Eugene turned Ned's friendship down (tear)
This video got me so offended in so many ways 😂😂😂
This video was NOT made for vegetarians.
Nah man Popeyes is better than KFC
I refuse to eat the burgurs at the Burger King in my area because you can actually smell the pot on them
drunk try guys are the best try guys😂😂😂 especially drunk keith😂😂😂
If you have not had Louisiana Popeyes it's so much better than KFC.
Olivia Newton John Travolta. I died.
"No no it's not!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
have the next drunk video be a my little pony reaction. not the theme song because that is the worst of it. but find funny some funny clips and show it to them
I never knew how much I needed the 'la la las' that Keith and Zach kept singing in my life until this very moment
Keith is so sweet😍😚
DRUNK EUGENE IS MY FAVORITE PERSON OML
it was so funny
Ughhh this made me so hungryyyyy
LAAA la la
Keith went full Seinfeld. "WHAT'RE WE DOING?!"
omg 😂😂😂
LALALALALA KEITHHHH
"Everything about this taco is amazing, it's amazing"
"I can eat a whole pizza drink by myself. I HAVE eaten a whole pizza drink by myself." -Eugene
lol Keith make me laughed lol when he is drunk lol 😂
This is the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life!
the try guys are so so so funny drunk lmao
Is it me or does it seem like the try guys are 'acting' drunk as a posed to actually BEING drunk?
3:48 I died!😂😂
screw Burger King 
they sell dodgy wraps and give you expired coupons 

McDonald's for the win definitely
Omg Keith Lmao.
God dammit I knew this video was going to make me hungry😂
Taco Bell is still great even when I'm sober ngl
la la la
Frame boiloiled
in what world is KFC Better? drunken fucktards
Too bad the video department of Buzzfeed is in LA because here in Texas, everyone knows when its 2-3 AM everyone is at Whataburger for their Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit Sandwich and Spicy Ketchup.
Why does buzzfeed always post doing something drunk videos. Can they not think of any new ideas?
lol pizza hut and taco bell are owned by the same company, no wonder its so hard lol
I was dying at the very beginning: "Don't eat without me motherf*#%*!".
The true drunk food taste test is between jimmy johns and firehouse subs
tacobell without sauce is a sad taco
They're too extra. Fuckin cringe .
By far the best video Buzzfeed has ever uploaded.
Y'all should of try street taco. Taco Bell is fake
Popeyes the best chicken spot.
0:43 lets see how we can turn a drunk food debate into something political #BuzzFeedGoingOutOfBusinessSale
"KFC LA LA LA " i'm crying holy water right now that was hilarious
Clearly alcoholic Eugene is not on the same level as the others. Should have pre-gamed Eugene. Rookie mistake
Buzzfeed has never made me cry laugh before
try guys try white castles
This was a bit of an overreaction
the try guys try stoner food drunk
Ronald's my neighbour .😂😂😂
I was honestly hoping someone would say their favorite was Papa J's at the end. hahaha
There's no point in eating taco bell if there's no sauce.
I dont think this was a fair test.... they didn't try Whataburger!
lately kfc has been good.Kinda better than popeyes
DRUNK KEITH IS SO FUNNY OML
Next video should be "Try Guys see a nutritionist!" LMAO
Drunk Zach is so cute
Put me in a bathtub full of biscuits- Keith 2k17
OOH!.... Its grilled.
I think papa johns clearly is the winner here
they're gay af
they are so perfect
KFC taco bell and pizza hut are owned by Yum! Brand
This is definitely one of the best try guys videos there is I'm laughing so hard
this video is beautiful, what an amazing display of friendship
do you market your videos exclusively to americans? because, europeans just skip over the ads. 
come on buzzfeed, make it worth our while.
"No one wants to see that Zach" whilst staring intensely...😂
I'm afraid I'll be like Eugene and end up liking Taco Bell drunk.
4:04 "I don't see the doritos in here " 😂😂😂
KFCCCCCC!!!! In SA is literally one of the biggest franchises. I'm scared to admit my love for it, like sometimes I only eat the seasoning and not the actual chicken.
After years of personal research the best food while drunk is.... waffle house
Hey, where's the jollibee at? don't know if you guys have been there before but their foods is so good.
Texans get whataburger when drunk. It's pretty amazing.
Fast food always tastes better when you are drunk or high.
Why am I the same not being drunk?
Not gonna lie, watching Ned and Keith share that burger was kinda hot!
They made me feel drunk LOL
2:44 bro
zachs laugh is so cute ; v ;
eugene cried?? same
now the try guys have a drunken orgy in all the left over fast food. crying.........
Can they just do stand up comedy for a day. But while they are drunk. Cause this is f*ckin hilarious. 😂
Keith is hillarious
"the burgers are better at hungry jacks" says the Australian
the papa John's jokes had me dying XD
Taco bell.... Taco hell.  Pizza hut...... Pizza but
I didn't think I could love these guys more BUT NOW I DO ❤️
Whopper King Place... They should actually use that name :P
I love the try guys
lol i dont know if they made it on purpuse but the audio and the vid are not on sync
I wanna get paid to be drunk AND EAT FOOD OMG I NEED TO RE-EVALUATE MY LIFE!
you can tell keth's brain exploded when there was no sauce😂 3:49
Keith did 2 fried chicken taste test. What was that reaction for?
I wanted that Zach.
BEST TRY GUY VIDEO YET!!
Try guys doing an escape room. Please please please. thumb up if you want it to Happen
KFC over Popeyes any day
The words Try Guys and Drunk in the sentence is something delicious. WAIT WHAT?
<3
I miss the old McDonald's fries.
"Burger King's a burger king, not a fry lord."
I wish you guys could come down to the South and try Bojangles. It's a regional fried chicken chain. It's WAY better than both KFC and Popeyes, imo. Great video!!
how am i the only one who thinks the try guys are so obnoxious now..... it's like they're all trying to be louder than eachtother.
Well y'all prob didn't get spicy at Popeyes soooo......
But like Whataburger though...
i cant stop laughing at drunk Keith
Beef and cheese
sooo where's jack in the box??
KFC is crap. It taste so good and you want more because those 11 herbs and spices are salt, pepper, and MSG. Taco bell too.
anyone noticed zach's wink at 3:11
I can't stop laughing
Drunk Zach is so cute omg
Am I the only one who thinks they sound like teletubbies when they sing for kfc?
His mouth is just so big. Is there a video of Keith putting his fist in his mouth? Or perhaps a grapefruit?
THIS VIDEO IS SOFT AND NEAT
Amazing, iconic
The try guys: sperm cell taste test
You can't call pizza hut pizza "pizza"...that's insanity. That's like buying Tyson chicken and calling it "fried chicken"...just no!
I need a gif of 4:22 - 4:24 stat.
Ewww I hate KFC. 🤢
You know what, Zac? We want to see you shave your chest.
Did Ned say "Put me in a bathtub full of biscuits?"
They were all extra cute in this video
why do I feel like there not drunk
"Taco Bell was the only restaurant to survive the franchise war... Now all restaurants are Taco Bell."
They've gotta have a Harvey's burger. Best fast food burgs ever
But Taco Bell food is simply a conduit for the sauce packets...
they're so cute weird when they are drunk
1:50 😂
i wanna see that 😂
Just so you know Eugene, I've eaten a whole pizza sober 😈😈😈
That one song that two guys did at a camp talent show a few years ago that's like:
I'm at that Pizza Hut
I'm at that Taco Bell
I'm at that coooombination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
this is legitimately the funniest video i have ever seen
how does KFC beat popeyes tho??
Keith turned into Jerry Seinfeld at 4min
I'm fasting... this is a nightmare for me.
5:07 guess I can't drink... no friends...
Getting drunk with these guys sounds like the worst possible night of drinking
lalala lalala I am lorde 2:42
"I know this one's gonna give me diarrhea, this ones a dice roll"
Story of my life
I've never seen Eugene actually ACT drunk like this before, usually its a billion drinks still calm and collected
it is realy cool
papa does not bless
generally compromise crack lens regularly photograph chest.
Someone drive Keith to a public and give him their fried chicken. It's THE BEST
I'm one of the ''people who want to see that''
the editing is amazing 😂😂😂
I hate 🐔
"Better sauce.. better burger.. papa johns"
"Call me an uncles donkey"
"This fight is over we can't eat pizza hut without sauce!"
This is by far my favorite try guys video, I'm dying over here xD
Real talk, if there was a place where I could get BK's whopper and McDonald's fries, that would be the best place on earth
Zach is an adorable drunk lol #justsaying
I wonder how American KFC taste like
"Ur killin it ned" 😂
Keith is so funny HAHAHA
3:52 - 3:56 Keith is SAME 😋
zach drunk is SO CUTE 😊
So much gayness
I'M LAUGHING SOOOO HARD AT HOW EUGENE'S SO SHOCKED ABOUT GOING FOR TACO BELL 😂😂😂
4:55 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"It's Olivia Newton John travolta all over my hands" baha hahahah legit dying 😂😂😂and hands down best try guys video

"Ronald's my neighbor" 😂
this was THE best buzzfeed  video I've ever seen
Jew

"we can't beat pizza hut without sauce" LOL ME
it isn't Louisiana fast.it's lou-siana
KEITH IS SO FUNNY! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH KEITH!!
Because of the end, I'm not even sure if Zach was that drunk lol. But he's just so goofy he probably doesn't need to drink
Dilated pupils everywhere.
"LOUISIANA FAST!" "la la la!"
soft and neat
Ned is the worst drunk. Lol.
What-a-burger is bomb to get drunk. :)
i would love to see a version where they do this but stoned out of their minds
Dude nahhhhh Popeyes all day
no no no no
How we know it was an April Fools prank: Ned didn't mention his wife.
The whole time I was watching this all I could hear was "Combination Pizza Hut & Taco Bell" by Das Racist.
I work at Arby's, and I was kinda hoping they'd be part of this hot mess...
EUGENE GOT VISIBLY DRUNK
these people must of never had SOUTHERN CLASSIC if they think kfc is great. Who knows the truth
Drunk Ned is so giggly, cute lol
omg Eugene drunk crying is the best
Olivia Newton John Travolta...that's it, we're done here!
Drunk people are the best 😂😂
They made so many papa johns jokes I was disappointed when they didn't get papa johns
Eugene's John Travolta ref made me smile because I literally saw him in person last night.
I'm actually dying this is so funny
Just going to throw it out there that Popeyes restaurants in Louisiana are bomb. Popeyes restaurants not in Louisiana are not near as good. I've grown up eating Popeyes in Louisiana on the regular, and ones out of state don't season their food like we do in Louisiana.
it's all about Mary Brown's chicken in Canada mmmm
0:19 "some people want to see that",zach are you drunk already?
And now im hungry 😋
Best drunk food ever?  WHITE CASTLE!
Soft and neat
i died when they kept on doing the better __ better __ better people papa johns 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Their too drunk
Please make this video but with lunchables
zach is getting cuter...... sorry for thinking that you were the least cute try guy back in the past
hahaha so good!
"the ham-ham burger at the whopper king"
Eugene: Out of everything we tried today, what is the best-
Keith: KFC! There I said it
4:46


omg I can watch that part a billion times
Hail Corporate
I love that they switched the teams around, they all interact so well with each other so it's always hilarious!
OMG I need to see more of drunk Eugene
More drunk try guys
GOD this made me hungry
This video is my new favorite thing!
Keith is me when it comes to Taco Bell sauce. I get so pissed when I have to eat their tacos without sauce.
don't eat without me mothefucker! -Eugene 2017
I don't know if it's just me but Keith reminds me of the crab from Moana
Mcdonalds big tasty and Burger king big whopper are my fav with the fries to and rink :3
wtf =/ buzzfeed
"Yeah Ronald's my neighbor"
"Is there any sauce?" 
'No'
"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!??!"
The Doritos taco is so good
Yes Zach, there were people who wanted to see that
This is sooooooo hilarious omL
Keith is my spirit animal. 😂
crispy chicken and shrimp with extra gravy saucccceee
KFC is better than Popeyes!?  BLASPHEMY!! 🔪😡
I love Eugene's reaction to Taco Bell
Best one since they did drag.
I would pick taco bell 😂😂
I hate fried chicken
Yes, submit to our KFC Chicken, SUBMIT!
I prefer Popeyes only because all of there other stuff they serve
What are we doing?!!
pineapple does go on pizza there I said it
Personally speaking the best drunk food of all time for me will always be Whataburger <3
OMG 1:55 I'm crying
This is by far funniest try guys video please come up with more things for try guys to do drunk lol.
"Whats this taste test about?" LMAOOOOO
Popeyes is wayyyyy better
I'm dying!😂😂😂😂 Eugene is so ashamed for liking taco bell. and then Keith is just like chicken! and Zack is like everything is beautiful!
I wanna work at BuzzFeed😩🙌🏼
drunk eugene is just less serious eugene
I don't think they're really drunk in this vid they're faking it
Try Guys high junk food taste test!!!!!
I think they need to do this test again but stoned instead of drunk. Honestly Taco Bell was like my "go to" place when I was younger and stoned but man now I wouldn't mind some KFC! LOL! Btw Try Guys, I love you guys! You make my bad days good again ^_^
They completely disrespected Popeyes
Eugenes drunk reaction😅😂😂
This video confused me SO MUCH
Taco Bell made re-think their whole existence
They are extremely endearing when dunk
Pizza Hut is nasty😷😷
The try guys drunk is my aesthetic
SOFT AND NEaT
OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN TRAVOLTA
S O F T A N D N E A T
All my ALL TIME favorites people on BuzzFeed keep leaving. I'm PRAYING that the Try Guys don't leave for greener pastures. They are just so great together.
Eugene just blew everyone's mind with Olivia newton john Travolta
"yeah i do, ronald's my neighbour" LOGGING OUT OF LIFE GOODBYE AHHAHAHAHAHA
I wanna see Zach's butt, thank you
0:20 TRUE
LOL THESE DUDES ARE GAY
where is this previous episode where they get drunk
A job where you can get drunk and eat fast food..... sounds wonderful
"Even a duck person knows that's and" 😂😂
So... Wikipedia says, Buzzfeed only makes about 170 million a year. Considering how much fckn youtube content on different channels they have, plus their website and google search results, they probably make 170 million a month. Fckn wikipedia lies...
When I get drunk I usually gorge on vegan frozen pizza
This makes me so happy
im british so ive only had popeyes once when i went to america nd it was bloody disappointing why do they serve scones with chicken what is with that
ken-tuck-ayay
Bojangles has the best fried chicken and fries case closed
Why did I think that they were going to drink the fast food as in it would have been blended into a drink...
omg too funny!!!!
is the korean guy gay?
I'm fortunate to live in the NY/NJ area so I can order great pizza that's not made from Pizza Primitive Shelter, Red and Blue Game Tile with White Dots Pizza, Diminutive Roman Ruler Pizza or Pizza Made by a Father Named John.
Yall gotta try the pirata taco from taco palenque. idk if you have something like that in Cal, but over here in Laredo its everyone's favorite drunk food.
soft and neat.
Uncle john
Lol I'm not trusting white people to tell me which chicken is better, especially when they're "drunk"
La la la
This is the best video the try guys have ever done
Ned didn't mention his wife? Oh right, it's april fools.
Dont eat that gay
is it just me or do they seem more gay if they are drunk
Zach is always so cute!!
fast food greasy taco i love
The religious experience that Keith has at 2:25 is killing me
3:51      WHAT ARE WE DOING
Now, I want KFC.
KFC la la la
Make a quiz for what try guy are you
Lol
These mfs just said KFC is better than Popeyes. Wtf
How about you pull an April Fools joke that requires the ENTIRE TEAM OF BUZZFEED coming back.

Then leave.
and if you have enough friends.. you can eat all of this! XDDD
i really like the editing
the ship sails itself
i laughed so hard i cried a little
3:52 ... dying
I didn't know I needed this video until now!!
Taco bell who? Can't get it in nz :(
Everything about this video is wild and I love it
me me big boy
Popeye's chicken got no votes but I miss it so much!!!! 

I moved to a place that does not have Popeye's and KFC just isn't doing it for me. Haha 

If I won the lottery as a way to sustain my new wealth I'd call up there corporate part and setup the franchise over here! 

But I'm not that rich and on a good month I don't touch into my overdraft.....
Now I'm craving for Whooper burger.. Thank Buzzfeed..
it was a bad decision. even a drunk person knows thats wrong😂😂😂😂😂😂
More of these 😂
living for them drunk
This was hilarious 😂
I wouldn't mind if the channel went broke and you all became unemployed.
"the burger hamburger at the whopper king place"
Kfc la la la😂
Drunk Ned is even more amazing 😂😂💯
I imagine they recorded this after their night out wearing heels 👠 🍻 🍔 🍟
cringe
When he said my d*ck is gone I lost it!!!!
I was dying the whole time lol someone please do one of Asian food with them drunk lol
I am Eugene when I'm drunk!
I'm a vegetarian but I went to an anime convention in February and while I was dressed as Sailor Moon at midnight I ordered three Burger King meals and chicken fries and ate it all and it was the best
Keith acts the most drunk
"What Fankstien sh*t is this?!" Best Eugene qoute ever! 😂😂😂😂
The way Zach is like "Look how... immaculate the top is!" Is just so cute idk why though😂
I really need pizza.
I'm crying about the Olivia newton john travolta 😂
Zach : "Look at it, it's so immaculate..... It's so beautiful ~~!!!"
The cap guy's face is twice as big as the glass guy's face.
Thanks for putting back the Try Guys on here and not only youtube red !

Ps : don't get why Zach is still single bc he's adorable !
Try Norwegian food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
are they men?
I love it when they're drunk
This is the best video on the internet.
Eugene is unpleasant
Only white people like KFC. Ps im not racist
Why did they switch them when they were trying pizza vs taco I got fucked I thought I had traveled into a parallel universe
TRY GUYS TRY BALLET
soft and neat
Was this meant be a April Fools video because if it was I don't get it?
They are all so genuinely funny hehhehe
I love the part 1:59
idk why but i have this weird crush on Zach
I seriously love the try guys, they're my favorites 😂😂
literally they edited this drunk too 😂😂❤❤
SOFT AND NEAT
Starting to find the 'try guys' annoying
Two grown men should never take a bite of the same piece of food at the same time.never
AND IM SO KEATH(or how the hell his name is spelled)
IM LAUCHING SO FREAKING HARD
PLEASE MORE DRUNK TRY GUYS
AHHAHAHAHAHAHA
So many good one liners!
soft and neattt
There is no way Eugene would be drunk off just the drinks they tried during their sexy drinks video. They have proven that in past videos. I hope this is a prank. 

So I'm holding out hope that another try guys video is coming on schedule later. I'm having squad wars withdrawals.
this is hilarious 😂😂😂
It's cool that they got gay couples to do this. I don't roll that way but I support the diversity.
This is my new religion.
WHITE CASTLE is thee BEST fast food when you're drunk or high #haroldandkumar 😂
Their drunk. Go hoME
I don't care if this is April fools it's still hilarious
IM AT THE PIZZA HUT!

IM AT THE TACO BELL!

IM AT THE COMBINATION PIZZA HUT & TACO BELL!!!
Keith's face at 3:51 . 😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😄😁😆🤣😂🤣and at 4:53
This was incredible and hysterical lmao
We need to start a partition to bring taco bell to Australia.
But why they switched at the end x') ?
Keith: What are we doing?!?!?!
There's no sauce
Gordan Ramsey: WHERES THE LAMB SAUCE!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The thumbnail made me think it was a white filthyfrank
Keith is hilarious drunk :)))))))))))
i just cant get oVER HOW EUGENE WAS SO FUCKIN' HAPPY ABOUT THE WHOLE "WIAT DID THEY DO THAT ON PURPOSE!!???" THING I CANT IM CRYING SEND HELP PLZ
Soft and Neat.
I'm hungry...
this was the best video literally ever.
ned: "better sauce, better burger..." breaks down laughing
keith: "better people; papa john's! NEXT!!!1!1"
I COULDNT STOP LAUGING OMG!!!
😂😂😂
how you gonna do a drunk test without jack in the crack? :/
Eugene is just getting over dramatic now. Keith and the dude with him are more fun to watch.
Lmao drunk Ned is me when I'm drunk. I don't know why but I laugh so much when I'm drunk 😂
KFC la la la (laughs at same time and tune)
taco bell is my sweet summer child
so fake
I need to get off the internet for a day..
S o fT
aN   D
NE  a T
IN THE UNIVERSE 😂
I died when Ned said "better sauce, better burger-" and Keith comes in "papa johns"
3:51 when someone says Justin bieber is gay
"Ronald it's my neighbor" and the Olivia Newton John and John Travolta jokes.  I laughed like an idiot
If only all the videos buzz feed make were a joke
when Eugene started crying 😂 lmao
yes! Drunk Try Guys. 
but I honestly need subtitles  for this one. (I have to rewatch several parts to know WTF someone said,  especially Eugene)
lmfao
The fact that they kept switching places really fucked me up.
Getting paid to drink at work mmmm
"He's a Burger King, not a Fry Lord"
OMG Drunk Ned! There needs to be more drunk Ned!
drunk or not this was funny
This is the funniest video these guys have ever done.
XD
i aspire to be this drunk with my friends.
watching this drunk made this better than usual
Also "Olivia Newton John Travolta" was the best.
mcdonalds is the best.. but with a drink kfc rulessss
Oh my gosh, this was amazing. One of their best videos. (And let's be real, I love all their videos tremendously.)
Keith and Ned are like kids who've had too much sugar
I love this video!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
These are the whitest bitches i've ever seen.
Title should be Drunk Gay Guys Eat Fast Food
I don't care how much people hate on Taco Bell. It's better tasty than most fast food places and like 50% of restaurants. Plus, it's usually healthier as well.

Taco Bell wins every time.

You don't have to be drunk. It's always good
"i never realized big macs were so pickley until i been drunk"
ugh...pile of fannies this lot
la la la
' why choose one when you can have it all?' 
because im broke af
What legends!
popeyes is a god compared to kfc.
"Put me in a bath tub full of biscuits"
Kfc in my country taste like sheer nothingness
I am living for Ned in this video
i feel like eugene is my drunk fast food soul mate hahaha this is how i am with food
I want to get drunk just to eat kfc.  they looked like they went on a drug trip as they ate it
They can not find a man who is not gay HAHAHAHA
Zack: Do you think Ronald McDonald paints his whole body?
Eugene: No, no, it's just the face
Zack: You don't know that
Eugene: Yes I do
Zack: You don't know that
Eugene: Yeah, Ronald's my neighbor

End of discussion
Next time I get drunk, I will get Designated Dave to buy all the foods :P
Hahahahaha
4:54 how can something be gone that never existed?
I love this video 😂😂
I think feminism is a good thing and all, but there really needs to a established line of masculinity.
now i want to be drunk to enjoy chicken as much as they did
Always do a drunk video, especially with Ned, because... trouth moubles
Keith's face they said that they didn't have sauce had me dying.
ok, uncles donkey
"Even a drunk person knows that's bad" hahaha
I am simple girl, I see 'Try Guys' and 'Drunk', I click.
I don't like the fries at mcdonalds... am I the only one?
Whataburger is the absolute best drunk food bro.
Ronald's my neighbour...
"drunk"
i need the stoner version.
Yeah they're drunk alright.
Olivia Newton John- John Travolta haha. Did they do that on purpose? haha
Obviously Papa Johns was the winner!
its a burger king, not a fry lord
I'm just like this without alcohol
Why not domino?
This made me hungry
congratulation! you have unlocked an achievement BuzzFeed: make me feel hungry and disgusted at the same time

here is a cookie
Keith at 3:51 is me, every time I forget the sauce
keith reminds me of Coralines dad
buzzfead: THE MORE YELLING AND VIDEO CUTS THE DRUNKER THE AUDIENCE WILL THINK THEY ARE
This is probably one of the best videos buzzfeed has done
i never realized that they got this plastered in the last video! XDD
The US burgers are huge compared to the ones in England!
they're definitely sober lol
How drunk are they?!
what was the video at the beginning
Sponsored by YUM! (Pizza hut, Taco Bell and KFC)
They should have had Popeyes spicy chicken instead of the original it's much better.
That was that expensive? Damn
WHAT IN THE DRUNK TRY GUYS. Popeyes is where its at yall. Get it TO GET HER LOL
This is amazing
Keith!!!!!
They are really bad actors of trying to act drunk
In case you saw this video without the comment:
S o F t   A n D   n E a T
i can't drink.
yet.
I AM LAUGHING SO MUCH
why the f is this entertaining?
I call for a recall add jack tacos and Whataburger 🤘
Their all homo Fasho
This is probs an april fools joke but damn i still laughed.
Yet when I'm drunk the only thing I'm taste testing in more vodka...
Thank you...for this amazing video xD
Seems like they are just acting drunk, to be honest. Like when you bring someone really lame to a party and they try to fit in. Kind of annoying... 😐
they should do a follow up video & see if the have the same response
I'm so glad we're back to Try Guys videos that feel more like the originals! God I love these men!
Eugene: Ronald's my neighbor!
"even a drunk person knows that's bad" HAHAHA
Like these fuckers aren't fake and hyper enough WITHOUT alcohol smh
"its a burger king not a fry lord" only keith lmao
They should do every video drunk this is amazing
Am I the only one who gets cancer every time buzzfeed comes out with another video?
This is the best Try Guys video in a while! Eugene talking about Taco Bell is hilarious!!
Olivia Newton John Travolta 😂
We know what these guys look like almost naked
56 billion animals are tortured raped and slaughtered every year of every hour of every minute of everyday please leave animals off your plate go vegan
I hate fried chicken
east of Chicago barbeque chicken pineapple pizza is the best!
damn i watch hella buzzfeed videos but I've never noticed how effeminate these dudes are
Why yall get the nastiest chicken. Churches got they spicy chicken and they honey biscuits be bomb.
Oh wow, even Ned's hair is drunk. Also, Jack in the Box tacos for drunk food. Or a Whataburger #1 meal with a chocolate shake.
best fastfood fried chicken? hmmmmm JOLLYBEES BY FAR IS THE BEST FUCKIN A GODDAMN THE MEAT TO FAT RATIO IS IMPPECIBALE TRY ITT!!
bessst video ever
la la la
"I lost my di@k"  why not say 
"I lost my anus"
Drunk ppl would never think they are drunk, if you do then you're not drunk enough :)
kieth is proof that all black people don't like fried chicken
This shoulda been called the try guys get sexual...#gaystyle
The tacos part did it xD
food like this could only come from above...
I love how Eugene cried when he choose taco bell
Taco  Bell is stoner food. How do I support my claim? I'm a drive thru cashier at Taco Bell and I work night shift. How many stoners do you think I get every single night?
"I could eat a whole pizza drunk by myself. I mean I HAVE eaten whole pizzas drunk by myself."
REACT TO MAKE IT POP
I understand what's going on but I though they were gonna drink the food by what the title says. 😆😅
Is it just me or does it seem like they are just pretending to be drunk.
these 4 lesbians are annoying
I though Eugene wasn't physically able to get drunk 😂😂😂 they've must've given him lots of alcohol
Drunk Keith is sober me about chicken
So this may be the gayest video on youtube, hands down.
do the same but do stoner food
make Keith a meme
KFC is by far better, but I'm also a big fan of Popeyes. It's all about the mood I'm in really. They can co-exist lol
Hah gaaaaayy
They're so fake
Poppa John had me
Drunk Keith is now my spirit animal
i think drunk try guys have all the answers of my life problems.
The are called "Burger King" for a reason.. McDonalds is falling off.. and the one thing they had that was good was their chicken sandwiches. Unfortunately, it doesn't even taste anything like chicken. Not sure what it is. That goes for both chains. Pretty much any food chain that uses real chicken will have a chance of beating these two giants. Chic-fil-A is a great example.
"don't eat without me motherf*vker!" literally me everytime because I'm the last one to get out of my room 😂😂
When they have employees to get drunk for videos, what do they do after? Do they have the employees to go home? Have them to take a nap? Get back to work? My questions are endless.
I love them drunk 😂
4:03 "it's not a taco, it's a TacoBeeeell", wisest of them all
Eugine is gooooood lookin 😍
2:11 lmao that's so me when i'm drunk
I love Zach's little giggle omggg
McDonald's. KFC. Pizza Hut. 100%.
Yall do realize they arent actually drunk right? lol
whataburger, hands down. like..? hello? C:
I need some Pizza Hut pizza now
It sucks that The Try Guys are apart of BuzzFeed. They're funny and entertaining....BuzzFeed in general, not so much.
Drunk Keith makes my entire life worthwhile 😂
this is blinking HILARIOUS
Keith and Ned eating the burger together was very sensual, intimate.
waffle house best drunk food ever!!
what does try guys mean?
Eugene and I are the same when drunk and hungry. EUGENE! Eventually you will want Tbell while sober! It's a SLIPPERY SLOPE.
I cant stop laughing 😂
They're such a bad influence when drunk. They all turn into children x'D
im starving
when ppl are drunk they get loud
when you Jaden Edson everyone loves fried chicken I said no they don't I hate Frederick cuz I actually do hate fry chicken
These guys spend half their  time naked and the other half drunk
im truely disappointed that you chose mcdonald's fry over burger king. Burger King. BURGER. FUCKIN. KING.!!! :(
The Try Guys try horse back riding (you could make it a series by learning how to train and take care of your horse, though for the training stage you'd need a different horse then the other stages probably because you don't want to be riding a green horse) and you should do it in both disciplines (western and english) and maybe even compete each other in a few events (barrel racing, hunter jumping, etc) :) Absolutely LOVE you guys <3
i love this video so much. sO mUcH
Where's the taco sauceeeee!!!( Gordon Ramsay voice)
They are the cutest drunk men I've ever seen.
I kinda ship Zach and Eugene hahahah
I didn't know they were doing drunk Lorde covers in this vid
keith lmfaooooooo
this is just too hilarious
I'm from Louisiana and I've never had Popeyes bc of a pooping incident a family member had after eating it once😂😂
Why is their entire cast gay?
The gayness bro
Am I the only one that wants to see them do this again, only sober?
When BuzzFeed gets sponsored from all the fast food chains in this video.
I agree, Keith. WHERE'S THE SAUCE?
Taco Bell is the best drunk food hands down. But with tons of fire sauce
"The fries at McDonald's are better, but the burger hamburger at the whopper king..." XD
?
That moment when you see Eugene vulnerable and emotional... about tacos
next try korean fried chicken!!!!!
Drunk Zack is so precious
Wow,  Keith's so red hahhha
why he dont have sauce 

omg 
omg
Come to Texas, get drunk, eat whataburger.
fake drunks
zach,  I wanna marry you.
Eugene, I wanna marry you too.
MOAR DRUNK TASTE TESTS WITH THE TRY GUYS PLZ
Ronald's my neighbor😂
Try hard guys.... the guys from worth it are funnier
Cringe
This video far exceeded my expectations.
KFC is flavorless
taco bell is the best drunk/hangover food
the moment when Keith freaks out that there is no taco bell sauce. i was laughing so loudly.
they are not drunk
Papa johns😂😂😂😂
I love them even more when they're drunk
Oh my god I missed the try guys. Zach I love you.
kfc is literally satans spawn popeyes is 10000000000 times better
Eugene is a mean drunk.

And I thought I was annoying when I'm drunk
keith is my favourite
This is why aliens don't want to talk with us
NEVER! trust an edited comment
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eugene seems like a diva when drunk.
eugene and zach are my new fave duo
Real drunk people would not be able to pronounce big words like ludicrous
The Try Hards
Keith and Zac are gay
i died laughing😂😂
Hello random comment surfer I hope you have a wonderful day!





APRIL FOOLS! 😈😈🎉
Seriously tho have a blessed day!
Best one lol
A bunch of dorks I would NEVER hang out with...ever!!!
its 4:30am and im drunk watching this
I'm with Eugene, taco bell wins all. I know, I don't get it either
when drunk
need and kieth  are the only ones that don't act like they do when they are sober
3:51 Keith sounds like Jerry Seinfeld
Ned aerial is the nicest girl in the world
Do "The High Try Guys Try:"
we need more drunk try guys
4:49-4:55
You guys all got pranked! Its april fools
"No one wants to see that" i want to see it, Zach is adorable
man this made me laugh. do more of these. lol
Does anyone else think that they edited this drunk, too???
Hahahah
Well butter my buns and call me a biscuit
I. love. all. of. you.
They were already crazy before they got drunk! Not trying to hate, I love them.
Oh honey nobody really eats KFC in Kentucky. Trust me, lived all my life in Kentucky and lived near one.
Fake drunk
Follow me on Instagram k_c__lynch I will sub to your channel
the try guys drunk is probably my worst nightmare... i hate people who are annoying
Keith: "THIS IS SO F*CKING GOOD!" 
Me:  🤣
The real battle: Taco Bill vs Del Taco
Which one gives you diarrhoea faster?
Yum brands represent lol
"Whopper King" hahahhaa
Tell me why Keith and Zach are me and my bestie...sober
In Kentucky (at least in my area), KFC is disappearing, or combining with other food chains (building wise)... Everyone eats lees or popeyes unless they have a coupon.
yup they drunk...
That guy looks like a horse.
I wonder how they got home/worked
tbh I would date Zach
I thought Keith was lactose intolerant
Dorito tacos are amazing but pizza is the ultimate drunk food,  I don't care
Eugene is so perfect
He doesn't even have the Asian Flush
Whoever edited this video needs a raise
Anytime Eugene and alcohol are in the same video...it's epic
I want the pizza hut. I want the taco bell. I want the combination pizza hut-and-taco bell

Like if you know the song
Obviously y'all need to go to Waffle House.
zach's drunk laugh LMAO
seems more like gay guys try fast food
is it just me or does this video seem a little like they're not drunk
"you don't know that" "yes i do" "you don't know that" "ronald's my neighbor" 😂😂😂
Yall should get them high af now
Eugeune needs to be a guest on jknews
the title is so confusing
i love these guys so much
Where I live we do not have Popeyes's we only have kfc and Mary browns
popeyes is NASTY
SOFT AND NEAT
This was so great.
I aspire to be like Keith when I'm drunk
This video literally made my iq -500
Lalala
They should have done chick fil aaaaa
Cute butt Zach ;) Favorite parts: seeing Zach's butt, KFC "La, la, la", and Eugine crying over the fact that taco bell is bomb drunk but sober untouchable
editing A+
keith and zach are so cute together!
so fake
This was gold.
This is sooooo funny
what I've learned is popular fast food empires taste good, in other news water is wet
We finally got to see Zach's underwear...
what ever they pay you its not enuf
The end though haha
Yo who else is watching this while being druk
3:48
Where is the Wendy's girl when u need her
Ned at 1:30-1:45 is ny favorite
the last minute seat switch threw me off i thought it was mandela effect for a minute😂
KFCs in Kentucky are nasty. Either they have terrible taste or they cook the chicken differently in LA.
3:51 IM DYING
Pizza Hut is literally trash
At the end, when he's like "Why are you laughing? What is happening?" that's exactly what my friend said, and how she said it, when me and my other friend were laughing our asses off the other day.. but we were high not drunk
popeyes all day
I was 💀 the whole video
Watching this high had me geeking man! Great video!!!
I love the intensity in this video
I don't know, I guess I've been visiting the best KFC's and the worst Popeye's cause it seems like everyone loves Popeye's lol
What about Church's?
Literally me when theres no sauce.
Y'all need to try chick fil a
"Inaudible crying" 😂😂😂😭
10 out of 10 will watch again
i'm on a low carb diet, not sure why i'm watching this. i think i'm trying to sabotage myself.
4GAYs
They're clearly not drunk.....
If anything they're closer to being high but yea, they're sober.
Still funny though!
better sauce, better burger, better people Papa John's 😂😂😂😂
I would literally love to work at buzzfeed, it looks like so much fun.
Did it bother anyone else that they switched who was eating with who in the middle of the video
lol Keith's reaction when there's no hot sauce "WHAT ARE WE DOING!!??!!??"
"La La La!"  kkkkk lmao
Drunk people are sf annoying lol
start a drunk try guy series buzzfeed
I watched this while eating an apple.
The only time I've ever found the Try Guys cringy.
Taco bell and pizza hut are owned by the same company so lol (kfc is also owned as t he same company as taco bell and pizza hut)
Looking back at the photoshop episode  I realized that the TryGuys really wanted to change their bodies but mention that time, money, and support was an issue. I say that they start a 90 day challenge in which the initially start with a gofundme to raise money for training, food, and other necessities. Once the money is raised they should all have a daily vlog or every other day vlog of their process over the 90 days. That way they can all support each other and strive for what they've all wanted. Like my comment if you agree with my idea!
ahh some Cook Out would be the best ever. Too bad its only in the east coast!
soft and neat
Wait... did they switch at the end?
I am in love with Eugene
Now Buzzfeed should do the same thing but for people who are hella baked.
To all the people who are triggered that they think KFC is good, they were drunk, they couldn't think properly.
Give these guys some fish n chips with irish curry sauce, and they will never want any of these things ever again
i'm french, why I see that xD
Drunk Keith is my favourite human.
Drunk try guys is my favorite try guys.
They're so drunk omg 😂😂
mom: how was your lunch?
me: 1:59
"yeah I do Ronalds my neighbor "
no hate here but i'm not really a fan of drunk try guys. but that's probably just me.
thats how u know they are white.. when they have no  sauce with their chicken
I hate fried chicken and chicken wings of any kind also I hope people find this comment and no this is not a joke I hate fried chicken
SOFT AND NEAT
Keith is literally me when I have no Taco Bell sauce
bit too drunk....
lol ned.
i love zach and keith drunk they get funnier than ever😂❤
#fixiDubbbzTV
why isn't anyone talking about Keith
I hate fried chicken. Like if you agree
This is the best thing I've ever seen
This made me so hungry
try guys try quince dresses



like if you agree
olivia newton-john travolta 😂😂😂😂😂😂
frame-boiled
OMG KEITH
omgod just omgod
The only drive thru open when I'm drunk is McDonalds, so it becomes the default fast food drunk stop lol
If you've never had KFC from Trinidad you have never lived before
Wait, what video is the one showed in clips in the beginning?
Please make them reacted to this video when they're sober
Sassy drunk Eugene is worth the watch
Idk these guys seem high instead of being drunk
Ned is my favorite drunk omg
Drunk Keith is my favorite
Please do another video where the Try Guys are all drunk again but have them eat stoner food combinations like in Shane Dawson's stoner foods video
i just cant get over keith and the sauce
Why was Eugene  crying all of a sudden😂
I don't LOVE KFC but in my country there's not even Popeyes soooo xd
This is why I wanna work for buzzfeed.
Are they all homosexual?
I'm a simple guy
I see keith
I click
LALALA
@1:45




Hilarious.
I love drunk Ned.
How much did Eugene drink?
Smh only white people would choose KFC over Popeyes
AGGH I can't get over Keith 😂
nothing beats kebab while drunk
DId you notice how they switched partners like midway...?



Also, Pizza anyday(:
The Try Guys Try to Pretend to be Drunk.
I think the try guys should play yandere simulator
SOFT AND NEAT
This was hilarious
whoever edited this did a supreme job and i've never laughed so much at a buzzfeed video EVER #papajohns
Would anyone miss these people if they died in a freak "accidental" fire
"Better fries, better burger, Papa John's" Lmfao I love Ned in every video but He's a blast Drunk
Drunk Keith omg 😂
Try guys try slurping each other off
Popeyes is WAY better than KFC
HAHAHAHA IM SERIOUSLY DYING
Taco bell is usally the only thing open at 3 am when you're coming home drunk so it wins!
Wendys vs everything
I grew up being taught that Taco Bell has rat meat
The burger at the whopper king place 😂😂😂
Doritos Tacos are loge
"When people are drunk they get more honest" A tiny bit after Eugene says Ronald McDonald is his neighbor.
u got to be drunk tov eat kfc lol
👏🏽 KFC 👏🏽IS 👏🏽NOT 👏🏽BETTER 👏🏽THAN 👏🏽POPEYES 👏🏽
this is the funniest thing😂
kieth made the whole video funny af
Raising Cane's is better than KFC and Popeye's. 

fight me
If this is a April fools video then were they acting drunk?😂
pfft light weights i need at least 2 four lokos to get drunk or a quarter of a large vodka bottle
we don't have taco bell nor do we really have tacos in newzealand😭😭😭
Pause the video, then go to 4:18 and look at Ned's face
I would love to hang out with drunk Keith he seems like so much fun 😂 but hey sober Keith is also really fun so I'd love to hang out with him anytime 😂
this video is why I'm subscribed to buzzfeed
THIS VIDEO IS SO GOOD
Ned is iconic! I love him 😭
I'm not so sure that these "drunk" videos are a good idea. There's no way to prevent young kids from watching them, and while they don't specifically glamorize drinking, they certainly legitimize it. I'm not saying that occasional drinking is bad or anything, but is it wise to normalize drinking alcohol in an arena where there are no real age restrictions?
this video made me laugh!
I want to get drunk with them so bad.
I'm from
Australia and I wish we had Popeyes! I've never tasted it but it just seems so much more like fried chicken 😂 lets be real! Still love KFC! Just cause I have nothing to compare it to 🙄
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are subsidiaries of the same parent company
This is the best video ever
Did they get drunk or high?! lolz still love it
im just imagining them watching this back sober hahaha!!😂
nothing compares to your grandmas homemade fried chicken . better then any fast food
why thare all gay's
sofT AnD nEAt
who is from the UK  me 🙋🙌👱
4:28 lol
Pizza hut does a taco pizza. AMAZING!
la la la
When you run out of ideas so you start doing old things but drunk
is it bad i want an entire channel to drunk ppl do ___
it's like Olivia newton john Travolta all over my hands...wait their names combine!?
La la la! I am Lorde...
This video is chaos
Keith is so fukin funny😭😭
I swear, BuzzFeed should really be called Buzzed Feed
"But the burger hamburger at the whopper king place" OMG Ned is adorable
poofter's..poofter's everywhere!!
I don't like fried chicken ☹️😨
They should make a video reacting to them drunk
😂😂😂😂drunk try guys are the BEST!
Keith is me drunk
They are much more funnier drunk 😵
SOFT AND NEAT
I love how buzzfeed credits men with the intelligence of a cheese stick
Is it just me or did every guy in this video seem a little gay?
They need to try Bojangles if they think KFC is the best fast food fried chicken. It's like KFC's better looking, cooler, older brother.
Keith and Ned are so cute and funny drunk
Ned didn't mention his wife!!!!
god I love you guys 🤣🤣🤣💞💞💞
they should always edit their videos like this one, it's hands down way funnier like this !
how many of there guys are gay lol wtf??
i did wanna see that zach
the try guys turn into the gay guys when drunk
idk how you can eat fast food while drunk, the smell of fast food while drunk makes me absolutely sick as it is
i dont see the doritos in here *eats a taco
"What even is this??"
i just realized towards the end of the video that they were switching off pairs on who's eating with who each time.
soft and neat
Who else here lives in Louisiana and eats Popeyes because in Louisiana there is the original Popeyes and no copyers
They lost all credibility when they all chose KFC over Popeye's.
"Eat bread!" How about no. I am gluten free because it makes me bloated and sick.
better quality chicken, better seasoning, papa johns lmfao
I like Popeyes better
3:52 lmao 😂😂😂😂
The Try Guys try the world's most giant swing XD
I wish I could get paid to be drunk and eat! Lmfao dream job!
they look more high than drunk lol
Guys their sober
"Louisiana vs. Ken-tuck-aye-ay"
taco bell saga
As a person from Kentucky, I prefer Popeye's.
Y'all should have tried "Bojangles".
Bruh... Churches Chicken beats out both of those.    Them Honey Butter Biscuits...
very suspicious that they "tested" all 3 Yum brand restaurants. Pretty sure they got $$$$$$$$$$$$$
can u try filipino food??
ps..
I love zack
I think Papa John's got the most recognition yet never got the opportunity for a drunk test ... #feelsbadman  (^_^)
most annoying video ever
"Why chose one can you can have them all" 
Exactly in this case for the Try Guys
S O F T A N D N E A T
Papa John's tho
Plz more of these videos
taco?... they should've tried crunchwrap supreme
Drunk people are so funny 😂😂😂😂
buzzfeed has some of the ugliest employees ever
i dont think eugene is drunk, i think he's high
this is the moment where jenna marbles was necessary bc of the lack of taco sauce n' the fact that jenna was prepared for this exact time @JennaMarbles
The entire time I watched this video all I thought about was how hard they must've blown up the bathroom afterwards 😂😂
Is no one really gonna talk about eugene almost crying because of a taco?
NACHO BELL GRANDE
CHEESY GORDITA
I LIKE YOUR TACOS LIKE DIARRHEA
MAN, I REALLY LIKE TACOO BELL

SOFT AND NEAT

LONG LIVE BURGER KING!!!!🍔🍟🍷
i love that when these guys are drunk, their latent gay selves come out lmao

I dont think ive ever seen Eugine ever almost cry or even cry wow just wow
I love drunk Try Guys I want to see more drunk Try Guys
Do horse riding
keith is me when im high af...and drunk...
"I can't see the doritos in this" -Ned2K17
Keith is me with no sauce
I don't think I've ever seen them this drunk for a video lmao
I'm surprised they got Eugene that drunk!
Gayest thing I've seen on youtube...
Watching Euguene cry is so satisfying to me. Cry away perfect man show me youre not a robot
"it was just a piece of stray lettuce" 😂😂😭
r they fagets?
That moment when Ned didn't talk about his wife.
kfc is so dry though.....
i'm vegan yet will still passionately defend popeyes as being WAY better than kfc come on y'all, you make bad decisions when you're drunk lmao (p.s. popeyes battered fries are vegan and they're really good, life is beautiful because of these fries)
I was about to murder them through my phone when ALL FOUR OF THEM SAID KFC WAS BETTER THAN POPEYES.
I've never had to co bell
Plot twist: They're not actually drunk.  This is an April Fools' Day joke.
inaudibly cries
hahaha! !!!
Soft and Neat
you guys are awesome X3 thank you for making my day!
they've never ate McDonald's before??
I'm vegan.
Whataburger honey butter biscuit at 3am... heaven.
Heaven Sent Chicken is 100% better, especially with their bread....
Eugene: "No one wants to see that Zach."
Zach: "There are people who wanna see that."
I am those people, and those people are me.
KFC is so salty to me
Instagram : roxanne_roxxanne
drunk Ned is adorable

April fools!
Make them go high
These four drunk is so damn funny. Ned is completely different drunk he's like they get it lets eat!
'It's got stores nationwide...' but there is no taco bell in England! Why?!?
Unsubscribed, nobody says Kfc is better than Popeyes😤😤😒
Looks like such a great time
theyre good at pretending to be drunk
This is probably their best day on buzzfeed. 😂😆
3:16 "NOOO NOOO!" 😂😂😭
Papa John's is declared the winner
Now I want junk food .....
There is no battle. Popeyes is better than KFC
5:04 the most emotion we've ever seen from eugene
Australians may not be kings of the burgers but we are kings of the donut (Donut king vs Dunkin donuts and Hungry jacks vs Burger king
"Even a drunk person knows that's bad."
I love drunk Try Guys
Eugene looks so much like the Kimara Black from this season of Rupauls Drag   Race
They get it let's eat it 😂👌😂
Kieth was epic in this video. Lol
This is my new favorite thing
are these guys gay?
I am going to say it again: Try Guys try designing and modeling runway clothes would be epic!
Ned drunk makes my day
I wanna be high and do this haha
They're being so extra
More drunk videossssssss
Two guys one burger
their opinions are illegitimate bc they said kfc is better than popeyes n i cannot accept that
How many drinks do you think it took to get Eugene drunk?
"Burger hamburger at the whopper King place" 

"Olivia Newtown John Travola"
3:50 Keith transforms into Jerry Seinfeld
Oh my gosh. They're eating bread.... IN CALIFORNIA!!!!!







It's a joke. Don't get butt hurt
I don't even like to eat when I'm drunk lol, but when I'm stoned that's a whole different story lol
Drunk Try Guys are the best Try Guys
Zach's "Oh My God" is killing me😂😂😂😂
What are we doing?????!!!
Do high guys best HIGH FAST FOOD!
also tacobell beats any pizza anytime unless tacobell adds backn tonthere menu
i kove kfc ....but it sometimes has a soap aftertaste in alot of citys
KFC reminded me of 7-eleven. Try 7- eleven chicken wings or rather the whole hot foods from 7-eleven.
soft and neat
They should release the drunk try guys into the office.
This is so cringy, come one Buzzfeed you're clearing running out of ideas
Hey guys! A few things you need to try...
1) all you can eat KFC ( yes there is a KFC buffet in Saskatchewan) 
2) A&W ( Alberta beef) 
3) Peanut butter bacon burger ( Hudson Canadian Tap house- opt for bacon instead of bacon jelly)
4) Bob and Doug Club ( Hudson Canadian Tap House) 
5) legit poutine in Canada 
What I'm trying to say is.... come to Canada and try our foods. ❤️
like= kiss your crush
subscribe= win the lottery
reply= 1 year good luck
Have a great day :)
they seem like annoying drunks
Should've been Wendy's vs Burger King
they all got really gay with the booze
I SEE FOOD. I GET HUNGRY. LOL.  I am a New YouTuber friends. I Write Stories. Can you take out two minutes and watch my work. Thank you.
S o f t a n d n e a t
Taco Bell vs. Pizza Hut is not a fair fight. Then again, Pizza Hut vs. my stomach isn't a fair fight.
3:53 - 3:56 when the teacher says "clear your desk" 😂😂
I'm drunk and I would do all of them except the asian one. 🤣🤣🤣
Keith COULD have said "fries between my thighs"...but he didn't..
burger king is better then mc donalds as my opinion
I am completely sure that Ned is a straight man with homosexual tendencies.
4:17 face
😂😂😂
"Don't eat without me, motherf*cker." 
"It was a stray piece of lettuce."
Drunk try guys = confused children
like ir you're drunkk!!!!
i don't like fried chicken
Ned when he drunk. 😂 i need a series of this. 👌👌
This is garbage
y not dominoes and pizza hut
do they only get drunk for buzzfeed videos lol they're actin like teenagers
"Kentuckiayyyy" okay Ned 😂
4:22-4:23 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Yeah rondals my neighbor" HAHAHAHAHAHA
I don't care if buzzfeed's pulling an april fools prank on us in the form of a try guys video, this is hands down the best try guys video ever
"Uh yah, Ronald's my neighbour"
~Eugene
I wanna get drunk with try guys :D
This episode of worth it seems a little different..
THIS IS MY FAVORITE VIDEO IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!!!!!!!
La la la
They should've done Taco Bell vs Taco Cabana
Popeyes is better than KFC
that Burger king bun looks pretty soft and neat
Marijuana!!!!!!
Olivia Newton John Travolta
The try guys are the best!
Burger King is absolutely vile 🤢
The try guys have gotten so old.
This is so funny I'm dead😂😂😂
y'all must have been FUCKED UP to really think KFC is better than Popeyes lmfao
Now these guys are squad goals!
KFC over Popeye's??? Are you drunk?!? Oh, wait...
Hahahaha the end when Eugene doesn't get the Papa John's joke
KFC is disgusting
And every youtuber wants views. Whats the point in making youtube videos if you don't have views?
I would love to try this with my best friend, but none of these fast food places are in my hometown. I think only burger king, mc donalds and maybe pizza hut are in my country. But far away from my town
You guys should do something like Try Guys Wear Makeup for a Week. I feel like it would shine a light on normalizing guys wearing makeup
Yes that Emoji they obviously  they do that because every youtuber does that either way buzzfeed did not force them to get drunk and eat food it was their choice.
Heehee! Drunk Eugene is just sober Keith 😅😂🍹
I was expecting Pizza Hut vs Dominos..
Uncle's donkey
"...but the burger, hamburger ahdgfdhth whopper king place-"
"you're killin' it, ned!"
The Try Guys Try Nude Modeling. They're comfortable being naked around each other now, but let's see how that changes when they have to hold the same pose for an hour or more while their friends draw them--or better yet, toss them into an art classroom with complete strangers.
The day Americans will give up their fast food will be the day hell freezes over.
The Drunk Try Guys.
just saying. I've eaten a whole 20 inch pizza drunk on my own.... I'm 13
Sure they weren't high too?
Looks like the same way farms do to there livestock.  Drug them up and feed them crap.
zac is so so so so cute when he's drunk
I was dying in this video 😂😂😂😂
How is Keeth the same person..
This was one of the most hilarious videos they've done in a while
Soft and N E A T
mood 1:59
i am but i simple man.
i see Taco Bell in the thumbnail & i hit Thumbs Up.
Drunk Try Guys are hilarious 😂😂😂 zach is just cute and giggly, ned is just all over the place, eugene is so serious and keith is just the best its like watching a shakespeare play 😂😂😂
I lost it at "Olivia Newton John Travolta"
Laughed so hard when watching this video.
I feel like they r not drunk and that they r faking
Definitely one of my favorite try guy videos in a while! I love you guys!
KENTUCKAYE
lolz, the whole time they were mentioning papa john's but for the pizza they went with pizza hut?! awww, shucks. XD also, zac...you don't KNOW whether or not taco bell will give you the runs? XD (isn't that the ongoing joke with taco bell? that it'll make you go?) don't worry eugene, i don't like taco bell either................i don't understand anyone who says they love or even like taco bell.......
I relate to zack with taco bell
SOFT AND NEAT
neds wife?
Sooo I saw TWILIGHT AND ALL THE MOVIES IT WAS AMAZING I LOVED IT GO SEE ALL THE MOVIES NOW GO ❤️❤️❤️💖💖
Oh lawd! What I wouldn't give for some KFC and mashed potatoes right now..... I'm jelly...
this is beautiful
fast food greasy taco i love
Who would choose Popeyes over kfc
the drunk try guys are my favorite try guys.
When they sang "lalala" I thought they sounded like teletubbies
do stoners eat dumplings
I wonder how miserable a person gotta be to 'thumbs down' a video. if I don't like a video,  I'll click on another.
buzzfeed getting their employees drunk, feeding them? = amaizing
Great now I'm hungry
Why is no one talking about how cute drunk zack is?
this video made me crack up so much, just made my day :)
Been waiting for this
As a life long Vegetarian, someone explain the whole KFC vs Popeyes thing to me. Is it like a legit debate?
This is me sober...
"Yeah Ronald's my neighbor." Sure jan (Eugene) But also I would say that too without being drunk. lol
S O F T A N D N E A T
Where's Chick Fil A and Arby's?
LOL this was stupidly hilarious
wait did Eugene actually start crying?!?! 😂
I'm at the pizza hut! I'm at the taco bell! I'm at the combination pizza hut and taco bell!
they're so drunk
Keith and Zach are so cute lmao
They're all pretty much the same people
whoever edit this video did a good job 😂
who wants to see Zach without pants? 🙋
who else "wanted to see that"
"yuck yuck yuck ew ew"
"You're talking too much" always me
Jesus Christ you're not high on anesthetics
Zack IS SO cute drunk
every time I see things like this I'm reassured once again that I would get along with Ned so well.
"Olivia Newton John Travolta." It's so weird to see Eugene drunk.  I thought his tolerance was too high to get drunk. :)
I need more drunk try guys
Ya Ronald's my neighbor 😂😂
It should of been Pizza Hut vs dominos pizza
WTH Popeyes is way better than KFC, you guys must be.....oh wait
Eugine ❤
KEITH IS MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE DRUNK
everyone knows.. the fiery ones are the best of the tacos
I have a feeling that when the try guys watch this, they're going to regret and laugh
i'm so concerned why did Eugene start sobbing over tacos???
KFC is trash, the absolute worst chicken ever
I love them all so much.
yelling doesn't make a video more interesting
"well f*ck me and call me an uncles donkey."  then u just hear a voice in the back, "yeah?"
soft and neat
taco bell is drunk people's food 😍tacos and chicken quesadilla
I feel like i've seen this before...
Anyone else notice there's been a lot more Try Guys videos lately?  And I'm ok with that. :)
Keith is such a treasure.
april fools. they're not drunk.
eugene hates taco bell i unstan
man what an original and creative video idea
"Olivia Newton John Travolta wait, did they do that on purpose?"
😂😂😂
They're so giggly and messy
I kind of like them better drunk because they arent scripted. doesnt sound so fake
2:40
"Well f**k me and call me an uncles donkey" - Eugene
Will it nacho!?
Drunk Zach is my favorite Zach
Wendy's above all. #Fact
you should try it all while high
Hold up do people not eat entire pizzas by themselves? If you're alone you order two pizzas. One for dinner and one for breakfast.
Every signal one of these guys could be singled out for different reasons for how hilarious they are drunk.
better people, papa john LOOOOL
I totally liked this vid because these beautiful people picked KFC over popeyes<3
When they say buzzfeed's out of ideas, just doing food taste videos over and over again, they decided to get drunk for this one to make a difference
KFC is gross
universe=us ^^
I hate that they're acting gay
i wish there was a black guy in the try guys
So, what do you do for fun on the weekends? lol
You guys should make slime
omg this is the best thing I've seen all day!
You can't have a drunk food test without Del Taco
Next Episode: The try guys run out of ideas
Why is this so funny!?!?! 😂😂😂😂
SOFT AND NEAT
no bleeping? wow!
Next time I go to KFC , i''m gonna say la la la after everything
Bahahaha
KFC is only good outside of Kentucky for some reason. I used to live in the town where KFC was created and that was just trash, but KFC in Cali was amazing. Don't know how that works.

Love how Eugene thinks it's impressive to drunkenly eat a whole pizza. Doesn't everyone just eat a whole pizza every time? And Dominos pizza is better than Pizza Hut, discuss.
I want a reaction gif of Keith & Zach going "NOOOOO NO IT'S NOT"
Lol this is gold
Popeye's > KFC
Taco Bell will never beat real Mexican tacos
loool
if I say a person drunk and act gay I'm out 👌
SOFT AND NEAT
these foos can't hang
The Fry tights....... Nope okay
"Inaudible crying" I lost it! 😂
If you are reading this you will have a great day
soft.. and.. neat..




pitorP
Last one should have been Pizza Hut and dominos
Keith and Zach drunk can become a reality show called "La-la-la-la-laaaa"
Now they should eat all of this sober.
cute
oh my god how much did they drink????
PizzaHut isn't even good anymore. I prefer the local pizza business.
Did they edit the video drunk?
if you guys are having a bad day just watch this...or my videos
they look soft and neat
Pizza Hut vs Taco Bell was the funniest out of them all.
Zack is the cutest drunk human besides Eugene but he can't get drunk, and I wanna marry Zack and Eugene both
Am I the only one who thinks KFC fried chicken is extremely salty?
Burger King's Burgers and Fries Are Better Than McDonald's if I had to eat one or the other.
the try gays drunk fast food taste test
the spices on kfc make drunk keith sing😂😂😂😂😂






La La La!
Eugene seems so horrified at himself that he would eat Taco Bell drunk
Am I the only one that gets annoyed of Eugene???!!
I don't trust anybody that picks KFC over Popeyes , it's just not right .
OMG FINALLY SOMEONE ACTUALLY NOTICED KENTUCKY!!!!!
The Try Guys should get high and then taste test fast food.
we need more of this, especially Ned being gay xD
WHO on earth thinks Mcdonald fries are better than bk? Bk are reaaalllyyy crispy and Mcdonalds are soggy. Or that's how it is where I am.
SOFT AND NEAT
love'em even more when they're drunk 💫
Ha gayyyyyyyyy!
There are 100% people who want to see Zack in his underwear. And less.
Jack in the box tacos are the best when drunk
They should show them drinking before calling them ,,drunk"
Why do they all turn gay when drunk
Jack in the box tacos are the real drink taco
Papa Johns better sponsor the shiz outta them!!!
they should get drunk for all of their videos
I'm just happy with how drunk they are! This was way more entertaining than those lightly tipsy "drunk" videos some Youtubers do! 😂
NEAT AND SOFT
The guy from 4:15 sounded like a character from the sausage party
I cannot stop laughing 😂😂 Love the try guys!
Soft and neat

They look like such sissies when they're sharing food. I got annoyed.

I like how there so over dramatic when there drunk😂
Soooo.... y'all just gone disrespect Popeyes like that
Getting Taco Bell without sauce????? WTF!!!!
The taco bell part has me in tears! 😂😂😂
whatever eugene picks i pick like if you agree
chick-fil-a is by far the best chicken
April Fool - this was all acting.
I'm sick of Del taco getting snubbed people!
Drunk Keith > Sober Eugene

"Olivia Newton John Travolta " OMG I never noticed that lmao ...MIND BLOWN
Doritos Los Tacos are everything that is right, and everything that is wrong with America, and it's a beautiful thing.

So basically everything drunk is amazing?  Yes.
Zach's "OH MEH GOD OH MEH GOD" has me in tears 😂😂😭
this was so satisfying watching
When you run out of ideas
Dominos > Pizza Hut
My friend told me that Keith is my drunk spirit animal and it is absolutely the best compliment I have ever received.
"It's like Olivia Newton John Travolta all over my hands. Wait their names combined?! Did they do that on purpose????!!!!" OMG IM CRACKING UP
KFC is trash 😷🤢
these guys have been feminized. wtf where are the real people at? buzzfeed is trying to push this off as the social norm
The title doesn't make sense grammatically. It should read "The Drunk Try Guys Taste Test Fast Food"
I wish I had friends
alright you guys gotta do this just instead of drunk do HIGH
I think if Steve would of been drunk with Steven on worth it, he would of stayed, look at how he acts drunk, way more personality
I used to have loyalties. WHERE DO THEY LIE.
I can eat a pizza by myself sober..😂
I Want to be Best friends with the try guys I cant believe their trying fast foods i love the try guys
Mc Donald's has two new sandwiches and they are mc junior and the grand mac
Zack every 5 minutes "Omakah"
I don't understand the "soft and neat"
KFC sucks, or at least the one where I live sucks. Last time I ate there I got food poisoning, and the same thing happened to a bunch of my friends as well.
so am I only one that eats carne asada fries when I'm drunk?
So, did the dude in glasses get hair restoration surgery?
"Yea, Ronald's my neighbor " 😂 Preach Eugene!
They get so gay when they're drunk
I NEVER CLICKED ON A VIDEO FASTER THAN I HAVE CLICKED THIS ONE

I said "they're funny and cute."

Before you ask, yes he's homophobic and has banned the watching of lbgbtqa+ things in the house....
I LOVE BURGER KING!MORE THAN MCDONALDS!ALOT MORE!NO OFFENCE TO MCDONALD LOVERS!JUST MY OPINION!
So Super gay its hard to watch

Whataburger is definitely the place to go after a night out

Honestly.. KFC was the best thing ever when I got super drunk.
my subscription to buzzfeed and putting up with their other god awful videos is always rewarded when they put out a try guy video, especially a drunk try guy video
3:10 honestly, the cutest moment in this video
they were trying to hard to be "drunk"
Grow up try guys, pretty pathetic that your all still acting like your in your teens!
It would be nice to see the four of them put on suits and TRY getting real jobs for a change instead of making assholes of themselves!
LMAO

Being drunk, not wearing any pants... Just another day at the office.
As a Kentucky girl I completely support "let's taste Kentucky" 😉
I've never ate KFC, but I know that Popeye's is better.
April fools!  They're actually gay hipsters.
Did anybody realize that Ned & Zach switched in this video?
pizza hut, kfc, and taco bell are all under the same company, TASTY (or something like that). and TASTY also sponsors buzzfeed. coincidence? i think not.
Here's a free piece of content advice. Do this but when they're high and see if the results vary.
im getting so hungry
The title of this video should be called gays try fast food.
SOFT AND NEAT
they're clearly not drunk and just bullshitiing.

These are the type of guys that get drunk after a 4 pack
drunk Keith is the best Keith
everyone is singing pappa johns song
They should have made another video where they all sober up and react to watching this video 😂
Half of the comments are about how they chose KFC over Popeye's. The other half is just SOFT AND NEAT

Burger King has a ton of transfat don't eat it
Why there is no black guy in this vid? Racism?
Anyone replaying Eugene crying?

2 to maybe get drunk with Americans...just once.

1. Mcdonalds vs. Burger King- Mcdonalds wins
2. Popeyes vs. KFC- KFC wins
3. Pizza Hut vs. Taco Bell- Tie
The try guys are the best thing about BuzzFeed
Love The Try Guys; and Keith is absolutely right:  You can't eat any of Taco Bell's tacos without any sauce.  It NEEDS it.

1:59
4:55
only reasons why this video is amusing
Ned probably only came for free food
S O F T A N D N E A T
Protip
I refuse to believe alcohol is the only thing they were on
I feel like I'm missing out on something because I've never had KFC or Popeyes
soft and neat
Kevin

Your drunk go home! xD
Send them drunk to a 5 Guys
OMG I love this so much 😂
"The pepper seasoning is making drunk Keith sing. La la la" omg

Taco Bell vs Del Taco and Pizza Hut vs Dominos...
Burger King's burgers are better, but McDonald's fries are Ammmmmmazing 😍.

Why did the chicken cross the road?

best drunk buzzfeed ever!
I can't eat a whole pizza by myself sober ...

Drunk Keith and drunk Ned are my favorite people.

olivia newton john travolta IM DONE
:ok_hand:
I love Eugene
😂😂😂😂

Keith is the funniest guy on the planet xD
How dare they use cool ranch. Nacho cheese is better
WHAT ARE WE DOING
pls....POPEYE'S OVER KFC ANYDAY.
fried chicken is probably the best drunk food
"don't eat without me mutherfucker"
no one was drunk btw
Soft and Neat
Side eyeing all of them for declaring KFC is better than Popeyes 😑🍗
Just sayin theu got white people eating Popeyes. Popeyes would've won with black people
I think Kai and Onew would fight Keith for that. No one loves fried chicken as Onew or Kai do.
Popeyes is dry KFC is bomb
soft and neat
what is this title?
You guys should try weed
KFC can't even compete with Popeyes 💀
Soft and neat amiright
Grown men get drunk that fast or is that an extreme over exaggeration?
Idk why, but Zach and Eugene are adorable together 😂
i preffer the nacho cheese tacos
I wanna be best friends with Keith and Zac
Buzzfeed is for people who aren't talented enough to be famous
"Do we have any sauce?"
"No." 
"...WHAT ARE WE DOING?!!
LOL
this, worth it and buzzfeed unsolved are the only reasons i watch buzzfeed
lol drunk try guys are better
got a little too colorful at points for my taste
4:22 eugene what are u doing LMAO
The Try Guys should get drunk more often... This was hilarious and I love them.
omg eugene cried?! 😂😂😂
Oh my god I freaking love them. 😂😂😂
i want to be best friends with all of them
"Burger King is a burger king, not a fries lord' I CANT
2:00 *FXCK ITS SO GOOD*😂😂😂
Omg I freaking died bro😅😅😅
"Even a drunk person knows this tastes bad combined, nope, yuck yuck yuck" 😂😂
IM LMAO YOU GUYS ARE SO FUNNY
This makes me want to go to all these places and order the largest thing on the menu
i want my life to be made up of getting drunk and eating fast food
the bruger....hambruger at the whopperking is....
Blasphemy! Popeyes spicy chicken is way better!
I love how Keith shared the food and when Ned wants to share with Eugene he's like, no. lol
Me and keith are the same person when it comes to fried chicken
ned and keith for the win
This is so fake lmao
Taco Bell over everything.
I don't believe that they are actually drunk.
Soft and neat
Try guys high food taste test
these people are all overwhelmingly amazing
i want the pizza hut, I want the taco bell....I want the combination pizza hut and taco bell
I went to my local Dairy Queen the other day and they accidentally gave me a burger with 4 patties! I don't know why, and I did not care!
This is my favorite video ever 😂
I believe little Zach and Keith are the drunkest, Eugene is the best at holding his liquor, Ned is jest highly buzzed, Zach and Keith are plastered!
what if you have no friends... fml
this is so fake
When you are drunk everything tastes good
2:15 what is Eugene saying? I don't get it
la la laa
step 1: like
step 2: add to favorites list
They do 3 rounds in their taste test videos because there are exactly

4x3
------------- /2 = 3
2x1

ways of pairing The Try Guys
KFC
la la la
the US doesn't have mcdonalds fried chicken ?
If I got drunk with these boys I would murder every one of them.  Pretty sure they are on cocaine tho...
SOFT AND NEAT
this is the cringest video I've ever seen, I might puke right now
my budgie kept on chirping at Eugene's voice 😂
la la la
Once u go taco u never go backo
im so glad ned made the papa johns joke
holy crap, these boys are bombed!
Plot-twist: They weren't drunk
have they done this with the high guys yet tho
I wonder what they would prefer if they get high smoking weed hahah
I want to see the try guys drunk way more often it's hilarious
"Don't eat without me motherf*cker" 😂😂😂
i died at "Olivia Newton John Travolta"
Pause at 1:41 and just think about that image.
Clearly too drunk because KFC sucks.
#earlysquad
W H A T  A R E  W E  D O I N G
What was the previous video? Wasn't it the sexy alcohol taste test?
Yes Zach! of course we wanna see that booty! thank you!  😍
Does anyone here doesnt lile coleslaw? Hehehe it taste like nothing hahaha
POPEYES = Bad Bitches (me)
KFC = Basic Chicken :(
Zach drunk is sooooo cute❤️😍
They're even more gay than usual
peppery
Please go to Washington and do this but high
is Eugene gay?
They should've had the 5 layer bean burrito from taco bell... that thing is amazing.
Try Guys make videos are amazing, DRUNK Try Guys however are an ultimate win
I clicked into this thinking it would just be another generic Buzzfeed video and now I'm going to order KFC and get drunk.
you could tell they were definitely drunk because they chose KFC over Popeyes
0:18 Zach: showing off his assets Eugene: No one wants to see you, Zach! literally looks at Zach
Omg this is so funny!
is anyone else lowkey sick of them
I wish buzzfeed drunk vids were exclusively a Kelsey thing...cause the drunk Try Guys are annoying AF. 
There, I said it. Come at me..
SOFT AND NEAT
THIS. WAS. AMAZING!
beta
But Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are the same company...
i love them so much it hurts haha
yo quiero TACO BELL
Ned is such a sloppy drunk and I don't know why this came as a surprise.
HA i'm eating
this is so fake
i just dont understand... how can drunk people not do simple tasks?
please does anyone know what "Nick's Quick Pick" fried chicken place is.... if not .... shame IT IS THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN PLACE EEVERRRRRRR
so all theyre saying is the opposite?
They should do the same food test but sober to see if their opinions change
Soft and neat.
3:50 I literally died laughing :)
I USED TO HAVE LOYALTY
Oh hey
Lalala
😂😂 stoner roots
Dude I love this
you should make a video called "Dear chubbs" chubbs is a youtuber.
what video are they talking about in the beginning?
Aww~ such a cute tiny Zach.
Why are they always drunk in Buzzfeed?
this is the best video I've seen in a long time
"No one wants to see that Zach" I do. I want to see that Zach ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
s o f t a n d n e a t
The best guys to watch on YouTube.
I wish I had friends like them they seem to always have fun
4:21 Mute it and then repeatedly sing "La la  la!" It's magical
HAHAH I think I was secondhand drunk watching this.
okay but have you ever tried the Whataburger honey butter chicken biscuit?? 🙏🙌🤠👌
😂😂😂😂😂😂
suuuuuire, they hae it hard. in great Britannia we dont have taco bell
No ones gonna talk about the fact Eugene started crying talking about taco bell
Gaaaayyyyy
Gaaaayyyyy
i just realized that zack and keith look a little alike
Eugene: i can eat a whole pizza drunk by myself



I can do that sober😪.
Whenever I see or hear KFC I'll go "La la la!"
At the end of the day the real winner is papa johns LALALA
hello
' la la la ' 😂😂😂😂❤❤
I prefer Popeyes to KFC though; it might just be that where I live, KFC's chicken is always super dry?
these niqqas gay af
You, guy with the glasses. You're a bellend
So BuzzFeed is now just getting their employees drunk and feeding them for views
Keith is my spirit animal
SOFT AND NEAT
a&w is the best though... where my Canadians at? 😏
Woop
la la la
La la la
Awkward moment when you can eat a large Pizza Hut pizza by yourself in 30 minutes when sober. Sorry. 

Also I'm surprised they didn't order a taco pizza from Pizza Hut.
Ahhhh fav part about buzzfeed, get to watch main guys drunk asf
Maccas
LA LA LA! l
LA LA LA!
PROTIP, SOFT & NEAT
Omg i think they were never THAT drunk😂😂
Soft and Neat
Zach is my drunk spirit animal, "oh my GOOHHHDDDD" my reactions to a T when I'm drunk and eating XD
Of course I am watching a try guys marathon and the minute I decide to take a shower they upload again
Am I the only person who doesn't like pizza
I have Emetophobia (fear of vomit) please put a warning of vomit on your titles. The intro gave me a major panic attack.
I feel as the try guys series got increasingly monetized it kind of lost its charm.
I LOVE THIS VIDEO
this video is complete cancer
When you see ugene in the thumbnail
WHAT'RE WE DOING !?😂
4 flamers in an eventual ending career eat food.
3:19 IM DEAD😂😂😂😂
fun fact: kfc, taco bell, & pizza hut are owned by the same company
"Burger king is a burger king not a fry lord" best quote of 2017
I was waiting for Keith to put the whole burger in his mouth.
the try guys are amazing
Favorite video from Buzzfeed so far
Why do they all turn gay when drunk
Who came here straight after the new worth it episode?
i think i have a crush on eugene 😂 

happy april fools day 😂
What are we doing?! WHAT ARE WE DOING?!
Ahem, I've eaten a whole pizza sober by myself....... and I'm talking 16 inch.... Yes I have a problem.... TT_TT
3:51 MADE ME SO GOOD
I thought they were doing the lalala from South Park lorde lol
"La La La"
OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN TRAVOLTA

Keith's Face when he found out there is no Sauce!

Eugene having a life crisis after liking taco bell was hilarious 🤣
Watching this as I poop 💩

The Whopper King Place... Now I want a shirt that says that...
110% sure Ned was high
Soft. and. Neat.
Ew KFC is so basic compared to Popeyes....
KFC isn't vegetarian :(
Eugene is extra sassy when drunk. I didn't know Eugene can get hotter
Hi, I have no life, can I get a 1000 likes?
KFC stands for Killing Fricken Chickens
These idiots make me so happy
That "Olivia Newton John Travolta" comment had me dying.
😂
"La La La..."
Why did they choose to give them the worst thing from Taco Bell? They should have gave them a Cheesy Gordita Crunch instead
You should re do the high heels video but the try guys should be drunk
Never had Popeyes because they don't have it here in the UK 😯
Are you sure they're drunk and not stoned lmao
SOFT AND NEAT
I've never had Popeyes 😬 or Taco Bell 😅
S O F T  A N D  N E A T
They still act like that without being drunk lol
This might be THE BEST video ever
Not sure if April Fools or just normal video...
