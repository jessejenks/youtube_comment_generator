Eugene's were so serious and deep wow
Has Zach made out with three co-workers? Obviously. Eugene, Ned and Keith.
I LOVE THE LIE DETECTOR GUY! XD
When Ned lie you don't need a lie detector to know that he's lying XD

Lie detector tests are such pseudoscience. They don't measure honesty, they measure changes in bodily functions like heart rate. Knowing that and a little practice makes these tests super easy to beat.
That was interesting, I would do that with my family.
the polygraph test doesn't detect liars

god hates lairs and i hate liars, therefore i am god
lying makes you go to hell
Is John acting like that on purpose?
It's ironic how the lie detector itself is a lie
It seems Eugene doesn't appreciate himself enough.
Eugenes laughter is so cute at 6:20 oh my god
Lie detectors are unreliable and everyone knows it. It just tells if your nervous or not

John: "He's telling the truth"
Zach: "Its an easy question the nuns are typically old. They're at the end of--"

"God hates liars, and I hate liars."  So John is God.
These tests don't even work. You can lie and be calm to mess with it easily, and if you have ADHD like me you could be telling the truth but be told you're lying because of fidgeting. There's been countless proof that these tests are often inaccurate.

I squat like Eugene when I get tired in heels 😂
Okay they really look gorgeous wearing them heels . what a funny video I love it.
When I grow up I want to be Eugene, not LIKE him, I want to be him
i have zachs heels ....they're comfortable asf.
Actually a lot of kpop idols wear shoes kind of like zachs or wear insoles he should try it more
"When I was challenged to dance... I muthafuckin danced"
Did we just witness Eugene fail?
Does anyone else find it funny that eugene always goes for the hardest option
I love how they didn't even mention they went to gay bars the whole night haha
damn eugene always looks good
I like the way Keith says toe nails lol
This is exactly what ballet dancers feel like when we take off our pointe shoes
zack has the same jacket as me LMAO
Heels are a "hot, fancy thing you get to do"? SInce when do people "do" heels?! :)
heels don't hurt that much wtf
yo he almost got hit by a rolls royce did anyone notice that
I could run a marathon in Zach's 'heels'
Drinking and party vids r the best
Live stream of giraffe giving birth on my channel!! Link is in my newest videos description!! Comment your favorite color in the comments for a subscribe to your channel
Zach Those are not heels those are chunky boots
Eugene looks better in heels than I do
When Eugene dropped it like it was hot lol
I don't think Eugene is hot. hears loud, shrieking cry of girls in the distance charging towards my house
I got the same as Eugene, and let me tell you that those are a living nightmare. 
I love em tho and I wear them as soon as I spend the night out
"I got catcalled" 

I think that when that guy said 'welcome to the real word' he thought you were a drag queen or something and stepped on your toe to show you that if you were gonna wear heels as a guy then you'd get beat up....Why is no one in the comment section addressing this?
Ned's outfit is SO nice!
I need that "Keith and Ned and Zach and Eugene" shirt!! @ 4:16
haha here at 59,843
"but i look hot"
Zach had it easy, those aren't really even heels
I liked Eugene's heels the most, because they made him bend over repeatedly. #booty
Zach chose wisely
They all look fabulous! But I love Zach's shoes the most and he was the smartest of all them also the cutest! 😘
Eugene and zack looked amazing in high heels
How to be Ned:
"My Wife"
"Does it make my butt look good?"
Ankle Boots is more Eugene's style
did eugene get that one dancing chicks number is the real question
I've never been so attracted to Eugene
Zach had it so easy! Those were everyday boots while Eugene was rocking those Lady Gaga level stilettos and they lasted the same time
High Heels on men look so freaking attractive
Eugene ur Goddamn hot🔥🔥
I wear 6 inch heels and I am 10
Yeah, this is why I rarely wear heels.
Eugene is crazy
Why does Eugene always look hotter then me.
This has been done about 700 times, think of some new relevant stuff like maybe girls try coal mining because that's a bit more of a struggle then wearing pointy shoes
EUGENE!!!!!!!!!!! OH MY GOD
I died at eugene's dancing
Ned looks like those guys that have boats in ten Mediterranean. 
Keith looks like that mom at their child's every performance and event at school 
Zach looks like a trendy, normal mom/woman 
Eugene looks like that girl that can do everything like a boss.
Who loves buzzfeed?
it's the give it a whirl fuckers
if you got no new ideas , don't do anything
Random fact: Heels were actually made for men.
I have to say: Zach looked really good in heels
"nope not wasted, just wearing heels" Yesss...!
Nice throwback to the og try guys vids
Nice
all could walk better than i ever will with our without heels.
6:05 "It's fun to dance on the floor" made me laugh idk why
I think Ned and Keith stopped cuz it was a stripper-bar and they have a girlfriend!! lol
kitten heels & boots? nah man. Eugene and Ned did it right.
also Ned went through the ringer that night, props to him
Zach's Heeled boots look like something guys should wear normally. They look great on him! Does anyone agree?
Zach got the easiest ones, Eugene got the prettiest ones
"who's that man, walking down the street with those delicate feet- it's zach"
i wanna see eugene with a girlfriend
Eugene looks great idk if im lesbian anymore
"My T'nails"- Keith
"im just trying to get home without a broken ankle" me ecerytime i wear heels😂
of course eugene wore the most extreme shoes.
All of them lasted longer than i ever would in heels
Buzzfeed you have already made a video like that please please you need sleep
i want zach's shoes
0:03 oh man... but you always do!!
the trt guys try quince dresses
Oh mah god my feet actually started hurting halfway through this video. I feel you guys.
I need Eugenes T-Shirt like now!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They would put Eugene in the thumbnail for me to click eo fast and like so fast.
"Six inch heels he walked in the club like nobody's business"
Rip. Just rip.
heels might look nice but theyre so bad for you
bootie heels are the easiest to walk in in my opinion
does anyone know where zach got his heels?
Neds heels​ are cute
Aaaand this is why I wear platform boots instead of heels!
Don't watch this video with a facial mask on!!! You won't be able to keep a straight face lmao 😂 😂 😂
Eugene's dance killed me  XD
I looked at Zach's outfit and bust out laughing because that's exactly what I wear on a night out.
Eugene would've made it with 4 inch heels for sure
Did anyone else like 2:32 ?😄😄, oh and has anyone else missed the try guys ?😭
zack got lucky with his shoe
yaaaaaaay
This wasn't really fair, Eugene had it the worst by far
That weird feeling you get in your heels after taking your high heels off.. Like your sinking into the ground 😂
Always wear heels with a platform, wedges or a thick heel😂
Anyone wanna hang out?
"I may have made a terrible mistake... but I look hot" me everything I wear heels lol
Damn Eugene got the worse high heel, I fell sorry for him.
I just love it when Ned brags about his butt <3
Eugene held it down!  😂🙌
all the try guys get handcuffed together for 24 hours
"My Fiance painted my toenails"....so is keith gay or what?
Zack's heels are what I wear every day haha and keith's are so lowww... Eugene is the real hero with hot as hell 6 inch daggers!
Is it just me who got worried that they would step on glass when they were barefoot next to a dumpster or walking home?
I'm female and let me tell you I don't look good in heels and these people do LIIIIKE!!!!
dammit they look better than me wearing heels
I'm a short girl and I wear heels all the time. Even to school
Of course Eugene looks the best in heels
EUgene is so fly he gets girls while strutting like Queen Bee
I wish it was a test every men had to go thru  XD
the best way to explain why girls keep wearing heels
 ¨my toes are bleeding but I look hot"
The old try guys videos are back!! :DDDD!!!
Damn!!! That booty though @ 7:47
As soon as I saw the title of this video I knew Eugene would have the tallest ones.
And beyonce dances on them for 2 hours while singing
XD Neds Wife...
Eugene's heels don't even fit, which makes it even more painful
The Abby lol
eugene is literally hot with anything
EUGENE!!!!!
I love you guys :D
ned's but looked great tho xD
and that girl who danced over Eugene girl you daring ;)
I Would Wear Zachs High Heels
Would legit wear Zach's shoes
more of the same 😖
They look like penguins waddling
I want Zack's shoes :D
Zach's legs looked amazing
Eugene is thicc
Zach is literally me when Eugene started to mothafuckin dance : "WHAT IS HAPPENING"
My feet hurt just by watching them wear heels 😂
that's my dad on Wednesdays
U guys can twerk better than I can tbh rofl
I'm a woman who doesnt own heels. I go dancing in my Nikes. 😀 And yes Eugene does look good in those heels! I probably walk sideways in those if I wear them.
Eugene looks great!
When Ned threw out the shoes my heart sunk.
Ned is hot
I'm a women and i can't use high heels all nigth
The best part is the fact that I wear Eugene heels for modeling...
"But I make these high heels work" -beebo
i have never clicked so fast.
I see you using that EDO typeface.
Ned looks so cute
Where can i find the shoes zach is wearing??
and again Ugene is trying to lok sexy Ned is trying to imitate his wife Zach is the cute one and Keith is just funny XD
YAAAAAS SLAAAAY, this is before I even see the video
I actually want those ankle boots zack has lol
Eugene killed me in this video😂😂😂😂😂
neds outfit is sooo cute and so feminine 😂😂 And zach looks so hooottt and cool THE HECK ❤❤❤
lol when I wear heels I always bring sandals in my purse or bag so I can change when I am done dancing or clubbing :P
i was dying at eugene dancing
Try guys: so what advice do you have for us??
Ariel: don't.
OMG Eugene
....Eugene Slays Everything 😂😭
Zack had it WAY to easy 😂
that toosh has got the push
when I tried on the dagger heels I cringed.. ouch
Ned looks pretty good in those grandma heels
Well they wear it better than I do. Sometimes I wonder about these boys
"These high heels are so tall, they'll muthafucking kill you"
I totally agree Eugene
Taehyung will be good at this. ;p
Zack is wearing the boots on the wrong feet LOL
They match their personality
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT, BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK.
sweet jesus christ...  buzzfeed made eugene gay...
I have heels I
Zack honestly rocked those boots.
this is why i dont wear stilettos. WEDGE FOREVER!
Their calves look good
I would sell my newborn child to be the girl dirty dancing w Eugene
They still pull of high heels better than I do
I seen korean women do dishes and house chores in them. LOLs.
Uploaded 33 Minutes ago, about 33,000 views.
''because they're so tall, they'll motherfucking kill you." brb dying
Painted my tnails
Zach looks pretty good with his heels. He should wear ankle boots more often.
that crouch at 9:03 GIRL I BEEN THERE
I love the try guys
i wear sneakers out #converse4life
isn't it just torture?
EUGENE'S DANCE OMLLL
Just watching the video hurts my feet
9:06 Eugene looks sooo adorable hahaha
Omf Eugene
I walked in heels as a dare once... then I started running in them 😏 that's when I found my hidden talent 😂
😱💕This is so cool, I wish people would try different fashions more (probably less painful ones though)😂❤️
Am I the only one who loves Eugene so much I skip to the parts that he is in?
zachs shoes are my everyday winter shoes
I laughed so hard , i can't think straight XD
Ned is me "They make my butt look good"
gosh I would toats date eugene and his dancing skills in heels
OMFG I CANT 😂😂😂😂😂😂AHAHAHHAHAHAHWHAHA
ZACH!
You cheater!
when eugene can pull off anything better than you ever will
Subscribe to my channel and like the comment and I'll subscribe back!!!
"They get taller! I get shorter!" That is total logic!!! 😂😂😂
Dammit Eugene stop being hot! (Don't actually. Plz)
I feel like Eugene took a dancing w/ high heels class or something...
the dagger strikes
"My feet are on the dirty ground and I don't care" I feel you!
eugine you have a dangerous weapon on your feet
On Halloween I had 4 inch heals and I walked around for 3 and half hours well trick or treating
No fair Eugene looks good in everything
I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt 
But I make these high heels work
Who else wants to dance with Eugene? ;3
definitely took YEARS of heel wearing before the pain was no longer there.  but thats because im sure theres some nerve damage, cant feel all ma toes 🤗
I was staring at their asses in the beginning-
I'm ten and I can walk better than them combined
omg I pay to watch eugene  dance
Omg I loveeeeeeerr Zacs heels they r soooo lush where were they from ???
Don't read myy name
Zach could actually wear those and they would look like normal boots
Ok but I NEED to find Zachs shoes 😍 anddd of course Eugene looks hot 😑
why can't I drop it low like Eugene 😣
Zach, my boyfriend, is gorgeous. he just doesn't know yet.
I told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
I have the same boots as Zach 😂
I love the ankle heel boots
DOES ANYONE ELSE HEAR THE MOZART REQUIEM NEAR 2:30
lmao as a woman i literally cannot wear heels they hurt waaaaaaaay too much!! i'm already 5'9 tho so its not like i need the extra height lmfao
Ok, but can we talk about how fierce Zach looked???
Tbh they look cute in their shoes😂😂
The boots were nothing thoo like it's not even fair
what's the point
I love the look of heels and the way they make you feel, but I have chronic pain so there is no way I can wear those damn things anymore.
totally dig zach's look, heels and all
They re looking hot  😂😂
Is Brendon a secret try guy?
Zach actually looked really good in his heels xD
Each one of them looked really good! even though they ended up in pain haha
Eugene looked better in heels than I ever have wtf
i am LIVING for eugene dancing and getting down in those heels
How sweet! Keith's fiancé painted his nails!
This video made me realize that Eugene twerks alot
Eugene looks so goood
where can I get that tee shirt that says their names on it like the one eugene was wearing??
i aspire to pull off everything i wear like eugene
I liked zach shoes those are the only ones I'd wear
damn eugene knows how to really drop it low
respect. i never wear heels. just never. im the practical over fashion type of person. however, this video is genuinely entertaining.
When they look better in heels than you do...😂😂
LISTEN EUGENE. STOP BEING SO PERFECT IT'S NOT FAIR😫
Zack looked pretty good in those shoes.
what the heel are they up to next?
Those boots looks good on Zach's outfit
I identify with Eugene so hard because I also wear freakishly tall heels (I'm average but all my friends are at least 6 inches taller) and am also stubborn so I don't want to give up.
Let's be real they all rocked those heals, but Zach rocked those heals the best(?) and I also want them even tho I can't walk in them
Eugene is serving sass on the dance floor
i lov the try guys!!!!!
I love watching Eugene take on 6 inches.
Was it just more or did Zach look pretty attractive in those heals?
eugines dance killed me
they look better in heels than I ever have tbh
I honestly liked Zachs outfit
Eugene looks so good in heels
Why does Eugene look good in anything even heels
love the classic try guy vibe of this video. keep it up!!
Didn't Buzzfeed make a similar video before??????
dang, they rock those heels!
I love Eugene so much
I love the try guys
Sooo Eugene is gay, right?
I love le tryguys.
hilarious
To be honest the only good thing about Buzzfeed is the Try Guys.
Damnit, Eugene, what CAN'T you do???? on a side note, this is really sweet of y'all to do this. Maybe it can start a conversation about changing some fashion rules.
Try guys get their faces beat (makeup)
Why is it that men can make everything look good without trying?
Zach kind of cheated lol
This got me shook and bald.
looks like they got gay vibes from them heels lol
Ankle boots DON'T COUNT
Zach's heels are the best!!,  Eugene what were you thinking? lol
Why do they all look so good with heels on?!
Eugene is just always 😍😍😍😍
Eugene's tshirt with all their names on 😍
Worth it plus try guys. Love my sunday mornings.  thx buzzfeed ♡
Beauty is PAIN
this is what happens when you lose a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt
a ladylike and a try guys video all in one day? wow
Damn poor guys 😅😅😂
A TRY GUY VIDEO THATS FREE ..... WHAT YEAR IS IT???
Ned looked really good in this video!
Eugene dancing thO
Damn Eugene!
can I be the girl dancing with Eugene please? oh my god. Zach really had the most comfortable heels though,  they're shorter with the thicker heel, so they're the easiest to walk in.
those booties dont look tht bad on him..he should actually wear thm to add inches to his height ..just seems normal
My mom has 6 inch heels 👠 that she wears everyday! Lol! She wears 7-8 inch heels for parties!
Keith and new in the same shirt
Keith was so excited about his painted toe nails 😂 I love it
lol I have those same exact ankle boots
Of course Eugene chose THOSE shoes! He's so extra™!
Heels were traditionally made for men back in the day.
Kudos Eugene. Wearing 6 inch heels is brutal!
The fact that Eugene went all out while dancing in heels gives me hope that I won't "flat out" at prom
Eugene's dancing.... oh my lord o_o
There should be dude heels
Eugene KILLED IT
yaass guck it upp😏💯🔥
Basically the most feminine and un-masculine guys you will ever see
Yasssss Eugene, those dagger heels are hot 🔥🔥🔥
Eugene is sexier than ever
Eugene doing a bend and snap in heels is my aesthetic
OH ....MY.....GOD LMFAO!
Who chooses the highest heels? Eugene.
Whose butt looks best when wearing heels? Eugene's.
Who looks best all in all? Eugene.
Who is killing the girls? Eugene.
Damn this guy!
Zach had the right idea.
didnt they already do this (or at least some men did on buzzfeed)
Anyone else ship Eugene and the girl at 6:24?
I see Eugene I click
Try Guys, Ladylike, Worth It. Please complete the list with just one more video, Unsolved Mysteries.
THOSE DANCE MOVES BY EUGENE THOUGH.
Lol if they had Zach's heels they would have lasted.
"Welcome to the real world", WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN WTF NED DOESNT DESERVE THAT
when you're 12 and like and can walk in heels
eugene dancing in heels. my dream came true
Zach looked great! They all did. :)
I love guys that do things like this ♥
When you dont need a nofication cause u are 24/7 on youtube😎
THIS IS SO RELATABLE! 😂😂😂
Eugene is so extra
it's easier to walk on heels when you're shorter, it's why zach did the best. if ned's heels were on the same level of comfort as zach's he would've lasted longer too
i feel like eugine is gay af
Eugene killing it as always.
I live Zachs shoes
When Eugene is sexier than you'll ever be. :)
those shoes look great on zach 👌
Advice for us: don't😂😂
I just love The Try Guys
Wedges are where it's at 😂
ZACH'S HEELS WERE THE BEST
Omfg Keith's getting married
OK BUT THOSE HEELS LOOK SO GOOD ON ZACH
EUGENE, ARE YOU RELATED TO KIMORA BLAC???
Yes Eugene Babe!! "But I make these high heels work" 😂😂😂😂😂
Eugene is hot even in heels xD
Eugene looks hot in anything. Or nothing at all :p
I watched the part of Eugene getting down like 10 times, my God
EUGENE IS HOT AF
Zack's looked pretty good
everything ned says: MY WIFFEEEEE . Look at my butt
try guys!
Eugene's ability to make literally anything look good is unreal
Eugene at 0:03 is how all girls feel 😂😂😂
Zac, you are so adorable and fun I want to watch Avatar: TLA with you and my cat.
Eugene pretty much Sade fk You with those hills
Does anybody know  that high heels were actually built for men the butchers to protect there feet from the animal blood
Ariel is so beautiful 😍
Eugene  is a better  girl than Iam
WORKED IT !!
Ned has to be so tall 😂
"does it make my butt  looks good."-Ned yes Ned it does😂😂
222

I love the TryGuys!

Zack's boots are cute as hell
Eugene LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT! BUT HE MAKES THOSE HIGH HEELS WORK!
What?did Eugene just say he doesn't like Christmas?
Why is Eugenes foot so much prettier than mine? 😂
What advice do you have for us? 

Don't.
shoutout to Try Guys producer Katie, she is a gift in each video she helps on, thank you for all you do Katie
can I just marry Zach?
Oh God. Y'all going to need a massage after this
Eugene slaying in them daggers 😂
I'm 12 and I wore 6inchs for about 6 hours once while walking all day my feet didnt hurt at all
Ned  and Eugene 😯😍
Zach had no excuse
Eugene got down harder than I've ever seen anyone in the entire world get down
I CLICKED ON IT WHEN IT WAS "NO VIEWS." THE VIDEO STARTS AND IT'S 80K WHAT THE HECC
"I may have made a terrible mistake ... but I look hot ."
Literally what every girl thinks going out with high heels on 😂

If anyone has suggestions for brands that have the most comfortable heels or even specific ones, please shareeeee :)
I love wearing heels! Until I stand up...
Eugene should start wearing High Heels. He looks S E X Y.
this made my day HAHAHAHAHAHAHA 😂😂😂😂😂👠👠
Lol not subscribed and wondered if they have a new vid and it just so happened to be uploaded 9 minutes ago
0:57 "Did I flush the toilet"
hahahahhaha
What season is this
They are the reason I still watch Buzzfeed.
they're not walking properly
Eugene is literally the embodiment of being extra and savage. Like what. And he's always out there doing the most possible, like wtf six inches.
Whhaat! what was that on Keith's feet, slippers? baby heels!?
Ankle boots do NOT count >.>
Omg Eugene's feet at the end of the night 😱😱😱😱😱😱.
Try guys is probably the only decient thing on buzzfeed

WHY DID EUGENE NOT MAKE A BEYONCE'S "SIX INCH HEELS" REFERENCE UGH EUGENE
sooo funny 😂😂
"But I look hot" 
When don't you Eugene
Eugene is so hot.... I can't
this makes me happy to see men share our pain
Hi
they look good tho...
Eugene in this video is hilarious!!!!!
why does eugene always look hot no matter what he is wearing?
packs shoes are gorgeous
EUGENE
Haven't even started the video and I already know Eugene is gonna work those heels
I would wear what Zach has but not what Eugene has on. Those six inch heels are a no go for me.
Ned is really annoying me lately
😂
nope not wasted just wearing heels
honestly I don't know how I feel about the try guys anymore, I use to love them but I've discovered a new side to zach and keith, not a good one, and now I can't unsee it...I still love ned and eugene though
I'm a cobbler . You'd be surprised how many men wear heels . :p
"Does it make my butt look good?"

Wow. Flashback to the weird underwear vids they did.
I LOVE YOU...oh wait you guys aren't aloud to interact with us.
"What advice do you have for us tonight?"
"don't"
Eugene looks so good what the heckk
They all still look hot👌
Zach's heels looks most comfortable.
" what advice do you have for us" 
" don't." LMAO FACTS THO😂
I was wondering why I hadnt seen this video before then I realised it was just barely uploaded.... whoopsies
who thinks they were posting videos a lot
eugene is so extra
hi
Hi ._.
welp... I think they finally died inside 👠
They walked better and lasted longer then me...I've failed as a woman😓😢😢😢
I prefer Dager Pumps. I may stumble and fall, but it's worth it.
I guess their pain tolerance will go sky HIGH.



Yes, I know, terrible pun.
I'm a feminist and only sexually identify as an attack helicopter
if it's shorter than 4 inches, it's not even "high" heels
But they weren't drunk.
Promise it would have gone 10x worse if they were pissed!
i was just thinking when are the the try guys going to post a new video

Potato stamps
Keith is me whenever I eat food... (not drunk lmao)
Wow this is funny asf
Eugene is so selfloving. It's disgusting.
Did anybody notice that they switched parateners in the last round
I wish I can do this. But I'm still young.
Tell me how Eugene can be attractive no matter what state he's in
OH MY GOD KEITH

Kfc makes me sick and my cousin told me what is in their chicken she worked there. I was disgusted.
GMM again, Holyshit stop!!!!!! 
ps. SOFT AND NEAT
Eugene is genuinely sad that he likes taco bell when he's drunk😂😂
I see the try guys in my nightmares sometimes. Then I wake up and cry and go back to sleep
Keith's fry thighs save lives.
And now im hungry
K - Keith's
F - LOVES
C - CHICKEN





yes.
here in italy evreyone eats a pizza for himself
♡the try guys
who else freaks out whenever a new try guys video comes out?
I haven't seen cool ranch taco shell here in Chicago here anymore.
OH MAY GAH
Drunk Ned and drunk me are one in the same 😂
when Keith found out there was no sauce. 😂
SOFT AND NEAT
I'd rather be high than drunk any day. In which case pizza always wins.
"Don't eat without me motherfucka" I died laughing 😂
I loved this so much HAHAHAH
HOW DID THEY CHOOSE KFC OVER POPEYES MY SOUL HURTS
I don't need friends to order all of that >.>
Omg drunk eating is the best lol
ew kfc
But there's not a Whataburger in California... Sad day for them.
Didn't realize this was new
Wow.
I hate how gay this is
considering getting youtube red just for these guys
Keith had a crisis over sauce.
KFC LA LA LA
why do they all seem gay for straight men?
They always brighten up my day.
And make me want to go and buy alcohol.
But mostly brighten up my day.
Eugene is literally the best thing ever
Lalala
hi
Kfc is hands down my fav fast food,
Keith and i are on the same lane
The quick transitions in this video make me dizzy 😵
I lost it as soon as Ned asked where the Doritos where 😂
'But the burger hamburger at the whopper king place' lmfao
They need their own tv show
HELLO
hi
The Try Guys should try sky diving
Can someone explain to me what Eugene means at 2:16 in the video about the names
Like If Try Guys shouldn't go Red
just a random person scrolling through the comments
omllll
had to repeat this so many times to remember that they're actually drunk😂 especially Eugene!
SOFT AND NEAT
They are all gay I think
It's fun to see people drunk 😵
I really want to see the try guys try weed
I have never had kfc before but know i will:)
i just woke up
WE CANT BEAT PIZZA HUT WITHOUT SUACE😫😫
Now i am hungry

"Don't eat without me motherf*cker!" Eugene is me there. lol
At 4:13 Zach sounds just like Charlie Day!!
Why is there no straight males in any of these videos
Happy April fools every body!!!
"Ronald's my neighbor."
Oh now I want KFC
Ooh a new Try Guys video!! *sees the 7 minutes ago* dang it
5:24 I love that they've shown Adam, that too in a creepy way XD
Eugene and Zack are such polar opposite drunks.
who thinks they are uploading many videos in only one day
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY CHOSE KFC OVER POPEYES?????
All of them drunk is my personality sober. This is amazing lmao
Well I know what I'm going to do tonight!
eugene has never been cuter
Keith when they didn't have sauce is me 24/7
Comment done and I'll sub back on 5 counts
They are so trying to look sober but it's not working.
