It's hard to watch this now that we know that JonTron is actually rapist.
shit your voice sounds like mark hoppus
I have a friend who likes this kind of music unironically... Sometimes I pretend I don't know him.
this is my favorite video, i've watched it so many times
Sick moves duhd!
I saw Jontron and I hit like because I love him
It makes me sad they don't do so many crazy shit like this anymore :(
This is my favorite video
Did anyone actually get on yellow socks?
Thicc
why is this so funny 3:43
I agree with filthy frank "you've taken this too far this is fuckin stupid"
"you look like a highlander with down syndrome".
Did anyone notice at 4:01 the lady picks her nose
11:25 Rhett??
Everybody always asks "Is Hila down with this?" HAHAHAH
my tale of trying to buy an art print: 
For weeks I had been looking for where Ethan and Hila got their art from(on the wall) after research I find out Hila is a pretty great artist! Great! So I go to buy a print and oh lord was it a 30 minute journey. I go yo Society6 'cards can't be processed right now' we try PayPal, same thing. So I go on RedBubble. Meanwhile my mom is helping me, so I am forced to watch as a confused mother watches the midst of quintuple chins, and Vape Nation merch that we are forced to surf through. There aren't any art prints on red bundle. we try Society6 again, finally it works!

the moral: please sell art prints on redbubble
I'm gonna use that "jizzkuzi" line
Get Down was made in 2003...
This is my all time favorite H3H3 vid. I am a 90's kid, I know exactly what you are talking about.
Oh fuck... they're all the same... SHIT HOW ARE THEY TOTALLY TUBULAR!? UGH! The frosted tips are too identical... and blinding... 😥
ethans dumb thicc 😩😩😩😭😭😭😭🍑🍑🍑🍑
Best H3H3 video ever.
in 90s was komunizm :\ ( in my country)
surprisingly, I like his hair like that
@h3h3productions who's the artist of your living room wall pictures? Love them
Ethan is Thicc AF
wow that look at 5:05 is simply legendary lol
israeli carrot omg
Ethan's song is actually great








So much potential in the Future
this is my favorite video on YouTube
2:03 well Rick and morty
one year already hmmm
This is my favorite h3 video for sure
it's like adult swim on youtube
I'm  the last generation of the 90's  kid. I was born in 1999.
You look like you escaped a female prison
Yellow socks = 90s?
its a viewmaster ethan god you say your a 90s kid but are you
Fuck me I think I woke the whole flat up laughing at this, the walk he does always pushes me over the edge.
Whenever I'm sad, I just watch this video and then I'm less sad.
I love you guys so much I want to have sex with both of you in a beautiful love making type of way maybe on a island somewhere idk
When frank came I died of laughter
1:17
Ethan's mid life crisis meets mental breakdown
ethan and hila need to react to this video
You can see frank trying not to laugh XD
I think the best costume party of all time would be h3h3 themed and everybody dressed like Ethan's epic characters
Please, give me a full version! I actually kinda like your voice.
2016 socks!
Still one of the greatest videos they've ever made
God I can't get down on anybody..this sucks.
I cry every time I watch this shit😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
the best channel on youtube! <3
This video is pure gold, er, bronze
i thought the ethan meant ethan blueberry
I was Ethan bradberry
Ethan's voice makes me JIZZ
I don't mind paying for a ringtone version of that song
I don't think even Filthy Frank knows how to make himself look as ridiculous as Ethan can.
Am I the only 90's kid that doesn't like the 90's?
DEAR WHITE PEOPLE IS ADVERTISING ON ALL YOUR VIDEOS
its sound like the boomafoo theme
Jon the Nazi nice to see u bro
Ethan you forgot to take your shirt off
Ethan, great moves... http://makeagif.com/i/6J6QK_ ...keep it up!
I got a McDonald's ad yay
The greatest YouTube video on the site
EPIC!!
that ass tho 🤒👉👈👬🔩💩
best video on youtube hands down
It's so nice that Ethan's carer brought him out so he could get a tan.
You like like a highlighter with Down syndrome
This is quite possibly my favorite h3h3 video
Israeli  carrot ..
ethans got moves!!
Write a tumblr post filthy frank you PC bitch
The real messages behind this is that it doesn't matter how you look. But it's really about the quality of your memes.
That was hilarious I miss the Nineteez
Ethan should try and ask the real franku to join his boyband, now that he's back.

Obviously this fake one he asked in the vid would just insult him, because he's a chromosome hungry cunt.
b4-4 are like a group of shitty Simpson cosplayers
"Bronze Means 3rd Place.. You ain't Shit Nigga" LMAOOO
O V E R   T O   M Y   H O U S E
The guy at 5:15 sums it all up
The 90s was cancer
hey i just realised Ethan is a 90s kid
I got off to this
im pretty sure leafy would like a chin with tan
coughs in 3D
This is so good.
those guys look like fags from Australia Yo!
oh god, you look like an arab XD
this is honestly YouTube gold
I heard about the song first from one of NLs binding of Isaac videos
i can't even put into words how much i love this video
you've taken too far this is fucking stupid
my favorite ethan and hila vid after jrhnbr
The only thing anyone really misses is Snow.
very funny
What band is this
Pretty sure these guys are suffering from liver failure; not cool Ethan.
frank's face at 6:58 kills me every fucking time
(0:19) looks like one of the 3 orange-coloured truck drivers has a 'chubby' in his jeans, and is mushing it into the face/shoulder of ...his 'bro'?

Btw: +h3h3Productions ; those are NOT 'VR glasses' (1:13), it's a 'Vew-Master'. 

Calling it 'VR-glasses' - simply based upon it's shape makes as much sense, as if he picked up a pair of binoculars, opera glasses, or a lorgnette.

They've nothing - zilch, nada - 'goose-eggs' in common.

(P.S., what are you doing in my neighborhood - 5:15?!?)
I feel like nearly all comedy youtubers eventually become boring or there's only some content they produce that I enjoy but h3h3 legit make me shit myself laughing with everything you make..so thank you for that bro
2:21 I just fucking lost it, this guy is hilarious!
He was fine but then he cut too much off the top.
I wanna make you cum....... That is all, Thank you
Can't believe I've been watching h3h3 for a little over a year now 😂 papa bless 🙌🏻
he looks like a transvestite that just gave up
this song is from 2000
Can we just bring the 80's back? The 90's were just.... yeah... shit.
i want to see the bts of this video its gonna be super
b4-4 where are they now
Ethan looks like a penguin from Club Penguin.
Ethan looked like mr paparazzi dude haha
"" Bronze means third place""
they look like fucking demons
I need Filthy Frank to be my life coach. Look how well he deals with Ethan from 7:00 - 9:00
He actually looks like the guy singing
This is one of the most autistic things anyone has ever done
Calling filthy frank pc, wow
Ethan had the LaMelo ball cut bacc last year
He's strangely sexy in this.
Ethan looks like a fupa version of Logan the Wolverine
Ethan Klein  is no longer Ethan Klein  in this episode.....he is........Ethanielous ReKleineri
This is honestly funny as fuck ROFL.
i need to stop watching this fucking video. I've watched this on my phone and PC multiple times for some weird reason. I miss the 90s
5:04 holy fucking shit hahahahahahahahahaha
Ian looked like Xtentation now that I see this again.
I used to love Jontron. Why'd he have to go and do a racism
The 90s were literally the worst tho
Lmfaoooo I've never laughed so hard 4:00 - 4:45
is this a prequel to trying weird gold products?
damn. loved it.a good job team
Looking like fabregas
Ethan Klien is number 1 thicc daddy and my name is also Ethan so I'm number 1.5 thicc daddy
are u serious  Ethan?
I'll only watch the full ads for Ethan and Hila h3h3
2:18 - 2:24, ahahahah fuck me. that was hilarious!!
h3h3 is just so devoted to the joke, I love him. Deserves way more credit.
Ethan, your vids always make me laugh my ass off... and get a little queasy
why did he say hes gonna make his sister come?
Ethan, I'm coming back to this video a year later. I need to say, are you ok. Like vro, honestly, did uncle touch you again?
Jontron looks like a neckbeard so they both look fucking ridiculous.
You can see right into Ethan's immense regret at 12:15
wow, Ethan.....this is so good
I love his ass
THE COUGH!
He sounds like mark hoppus
this guy... is a fuckin' genius
Ethan, I appreciate your shaved pits.
why do you only have 3 million subs???
2:18 sexy af
those hips ethan
ayyy 1 year anniversary
I love ya Ethan, but you do know it's a view master, not a VR headset, right?
if you get down on me
what tf
One of the funniest things I've seen on YouTube!!!
ONE YEAR!!!!!!!!
My baby boy JonTron. 😞
"Don't you miss the 90's, man?"
Ethan, nobody misses the 90s. Not even 90s kids, and they had the best cartoons!!
1 ya
Today is the one year anniversary of this video
Year anniversary
It was a dark decade. A different time.
This is honestly my favorite episode
Why is frank still fake in this?
Is this on iTunes?
wtf man, I watched this on april 16th 2017 how the fuck is this real hahaha cough cough....
I have those swimsuit shorts thing
All hail our bronze 90s god!

Favorite h3h3 video!
Drop dat shit on Spotify, I wanna pay for that
Imagine if Jon and Frank joined the band....One direction would be fucked, Oh wait
12:51 I cummed here
Who wrote your theme music???
It's fucking awesome!!!!!
7:10 put all your shit in a shit box and sell it at a shit store, get your shit together
Why didn't you shave Ethan, of course you're not going to look like your favorite blonde skin cutie pie, you had that beard and stubble bro, think like the 90's.
"I'm gonna make you cum tonight... Over to my house"
LOL!!!
This is a fucking masterpiece
this sounds like this song belongs in doa beach volleyball
I bleached my hair and I feel like Ethan as a boy band member.
this is by far my favorite h3 video.
8:10 Isn't that the fake Frank that Chin Chin replaced the REAL Frank with. I bet the REAL Frank would be on board with Ethan.
pc BITCH
LMAO Papa Franku scolding his two kids like "Ethan, I can expect this level of retardness of you... But your sister. Why did you had to drag your sister along with your goofs and gaffs? I'm so disappointed."
6:20 awwww we all know now the reason jon didn't want a part of Ethan's goofs
thank you.
Did anyone else like Ethan s song?
"you look like... an Israeli carrot" hahaha fukin hell JonTron
Jon goes about 10 seconds before he says some race related shit.
13:15 if Aziz Ansari let go
I would be to pussy to do what you do in public , you have some balls my freind
That intro to the song sounds like something you'd get from a nightcore song
wow,i can see the a lot of editing effort in the video . thank u h3h3 for giving us quality cintent
I wanna get the full song on mp3.... come on Ethan... please release a full version...
This video will go down in history as one of the most amazing videos YouTube has ever contained. NAME A MORE ICONIC MEMELORD.
8:38 "you ain't shit nigga" 😂😂
i remember having spikey hair with red frosted tips. those were the days
Frank says nigga and nobody bats an eye... PewDiePie says half the word... Everybody loses their minds
Ethan's face in the corner of the screen when Frank is insulting him always gets me
This music video made my cold worse.
I'm honestly crying 😂😂😂😂😂
Call me weird, but I immediately loved this song (and the song Schmoyoho made for Ethan) in the first second I heard it!
it looks like this dude is wearing a fuckin diaper
I used to play this song every single day in my high school cafeteria... it still makes me laugh.
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This is the best H3h3 video of all time
3:05 XD
how can i download this song😭 #90'sNostalgia
whenever I get a haircut
Note to self

Song starts at 11:49
Real talk those guys are fucking hideous
I NEVER SEEN THIS ONE! i can see potential but...
2:18 Legend
Ethan should make a song with Jenna
im crying laughing
"Blackface" lmao
A year later ethan would join the true musicians (post-malone)
This is the H3h3 I love. Stop whining and stick with what you do best.
when Frank got closer to the camera like it was gonna help him see 😂😂😂😂
say egg yolk
OMG this is the funniest shit ever
man this came out like right after vape nation, i remember those weeks, best weeks of my life
lol when youtube demonitzes your page and you wonder why
Where can I get the song at the end in iTunes
holy shit a chromatic scale in pop music. this is unheard of.
dam ethan, u thick boi.
Ethan looks like Fat Mike from Nofx
THIS IS SO GOOD
I thought It was snowden 10:09
I don't listen to alot of pop but he sounds just like them when they doing their chorus
You know you went overboard if filthy frank himself says so.
Lyrics please
9:26 did you purposefully sync the music to that guy's footsteps LMFAO
ok but Ethan is thicc
Song sounds kinda like David Bowie
7:22 when your mom starts yelling at you in front of the guests and you have to act like you're ok.
Best video ever
damn even filthy frank thinks you've taken it too far. but this video made me laugh more than your other videos. i know you didn't like doing this but you need to keep sacrificing your soul for our entertainment.
imo this is the greatest h3 video ever. its fucking perfect.
I've just looked up b4-4 on Wikipedia and it says that track "Get Down" was released in 2000.Last time I checked that wasn't the 90's dude. :P
Puka shell necklace lol
He looks like Carl from Aqua teen hunger force
Quarter to one b5 5. I fucking laughed to tears. This is my favorite h3h3 vid.
Super cringy lol
remember ethan, it wasn't the real frank
something in this video makes me think of the Holaucaust
No lipstick? What are you thinking?
Tim and Eric finally fused
Our90's Are Back!...
I was like "what happened to Ethan joins a gay  band?" That was it right?
ourmine are back?
isn't it "gonna make him cum tonight, over to my house"? because they're setting that kid up with pussy so he's going to cum? but it doesn't make any sense because it's like the singer is going to fuck that little kid
what is this ourmine thing in your titles?
That chub and tuck thoe
did ourmine strike again or did you never change the titles back?
Stop trying to talk like pewds ._and stop saying nigga u dumb ass
Bronze is third place, that's sh*t, you're sh*t Ethan
All of my recommendations filled with this OurMine thing, this driving me insane)
"i'm gonna make you jizz CUZZI WITH ME ANYTIME" my favorite part
I loved it!!!
"If you go down on me Ill go down on! You! Too! TONIGHT!" NOICE!
Who's ourmine
Why does this video called ourmine are back
After preachin this video so much im at the stage where i now like ethans song,man, stockholm song syndrome at work
OurMine Are Back!... ( Read the description )
OurMine Are Back! as a title. h3h3 got hacked?

"You look like an Israeli carrot"
All of his videos have the same title now. What is happening?
Balls the size of fricking texas
Just watched hot ones, I'm so sorry Ethan
Why is he actually the best person ever
And then Jontron went home and complained about Blizzard.
Makin' you jizz tonight...
This is one of those videos where I just feel embarrassed for everyone involved.
This man is so committed to this joke. I only started watching H3H3 yesterday, been on YouTube for several years now too. I cannot stop watching this, it's so funny.
1.25
I know this is the most humiliated Ethan had ever been, but it is was so worth it.
I've seen this video so many times that I've memorised the lyrics to this gay ass song
LOL WTF why is that kid watching that thing?? LOL I totally missed it until Ethan pointed it out.
I wish I could give more upvotes.
8:38 philthy frank - you ain't shit nigga
That was Tidus from Zanarkand, LOL
I would have thought Ethan would be too dark skinned for Jon to want to hang out with him any more.
Your song man fuck me where do I start 😂 fucking gold man, both you and the track
Who came here from the spicy wings video?
This is straight up the most underrated h3h3 video. I've always been bummed this didn't get memed as hard as Vape Naysh.
am i the only one who thinks that ethan looks like a indian IT dude? - PAPA BLESS
LOL that song

Still one of my favourite episodes 😂😍
Ethan is THICC
8:35 say what
YOU ARE MEME GOD
this is one of my favourites!

I would buy Ethans single.
I laughed so hard. Oh my Ethan.. 90's makes everyone crazy.
9/11
hey,  you can't copy Jenna's 100 layers of spray tan,  fam.
you look like guy fieri's more rapey younger brother, whose parents after having guy were severely disappointed, just gave up completely in trying to raise you.
BOO HOO I WAS BORN IN THE WRONG GENERATION
Frank: You ain't shit nigga
lol
Ethan Heidecker
when Ethan sings at the end he sounds like Randy Newman with down syndrome
how you clean that fucken shit up ur face?
I'm gonna make you come.. over to my house. Then I'm gonna make you cum.
I LOVE IT <3
2K17
With the spary tan Ethan looks like a Jewish version of my great grandfather if he had down syndrome.
*has serious money-problems due to being sued 
*uses money on a spray tan 



h3h3<3
JFC Tim Heidecker's brother
Still one of my favorite videos by h3
Who else really enjoyed the singing part and thought that Ethan actually had a great voice?
you sound like red hot chili pepper
Filthy Frank's voice is so fucking irritating. Trying to sound like Christian Bale's Batman.
Schmoyoho has a little too much bass tbh
Franku had ZERO chill
he looked like george michael at 10:24
3:09 Blow me
         A KISS
Good job you made a person happy today!
ya too far,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,down the rabbit hole
"Hila, I'm gonna make you cum tonight."

"... you are?"

lmao
After he reaches maximum bronze he looks like Tom from parks and rec lol 12:10
Ethan is one hot thic bitch
I was born in the wrong generation.
"You look like an Israeli carrot."
This might be the funniest video on YouTube.
why won't they make more vids like this?
I've watched this video a few times before, but has anyone noticed that in the first frame of the music video at 1:17 we have Keemstar's gnome ass grandpa sitting there?

Did we just completely gloss this over? Memeception?
my fucking face when i realize i own those shorts ethans wearing
I miss these videos
BRING BACK THE OLD ETHANNNNNNN
If he wouldn't of fucked up the Mohawk his hair would look nice.
Poor schmoyoho and Jon and Frank man...
that's fake frank, real frank would've said yes, you should ask him now I heard he's back from the rice fields
This video was an instant fucking classic
This is one of the most epic episodes you've ever made.
how did you get that scar on uour back ethan
Jizzcuzzi. Case closed.
I can't believe Fake Frank and h3h3 were allies all along.
When Filthy Frank tells you you're taking things too far....
Jon said he is too busy saving the white race to join your boy band
9:15 Lmao He almost drops the tanning lotion
2:19 Actually, we didn't have that shit in 90s. OMG, I miss so much 2016 ç_ç
2:18
that FUPA dance is everything.
How this didn't get like 20 mill views is beyond me
lol you guys are so funny!
ethan i love you <3 please make me come tonight






really hard
There's no way these guys were ever taken seriously. Not even in the 90's right?
hila must be a very very strong and emotionally stable woman
U got a nice ass
went to papas closet got them 90 clothes
A quarter to 1! I'm dying...
10:09 Is he high?
PICK UP SOME HOT BABES, TAKE EM TO YOUR MOM'S PLACE
HAHAHA THIS GUYS FUCKING HILARIOUS!
I guess we now know where Trump got his look from huh?
sucks that there probably won't be any collaborations with jontron anymore :(
Is this what Ethan does every time he needs a haircut?
say it ain't so
I will not go
turn the lights off
carry me home
omg im dying youre the best ethan
7:30 that's black Face, loled so hard
That tan is Donald Trump level
when filthy frank tells you you want to far XD
when's the song coming out on spotify?
I kinda hope he was only spraying water in his face :L
Omg what did he do to him self
christ, ethan
this was the first filthy frank thing I ever watched and his voice annoyed me so much and then I watched ethan's homeless prank video and he was on it and I was like Wtf why is this annoying ass back.......ended up finding out he had his own youtube channel, watched his content and now I'm trash for papa franku,,,, send help......he's my favorite youtuber now
I've got serious hair envy on ethan
I need to wear this to school
dude this so funny
Dude. The dark haired guy, looks like he may actually be a Klingon.
I honestly rate this over Vape Nation. Pure Gold.
Fake frank has been around for a hot minute
Why doesnt ethan know thats a fake Frank?
patrice the menace
He actually can pull off that hair
Perfect body

Any one noticed that he said nigga
Whenever I'm sad all I do is watch this and it just fixes all my problems
I can see the kid watching me fuck lmfao
Man this is still one of my all time favourite h3h3 videos.
You know that if frank disapproves of it its bad...
Exemplary commitment.
is it just me or does the guy with the frosted tips look like soflo? xD
"bronze means third place" hahahaha
What a tool
Bronze face third place nigga
Ethan should've spray tanned himself, oh.
The boy picked up a view master bro!
the amount of hey's at the end is just right
papa bless.
God Damn thank you Edups for turning me on to h3h3. Love this channel.,
This video is gold.
I have such a huge crush on Ethan.
I like to eat acid and binge watch h3h3, I'm pretty woke
Bronzeface
that dude in the black tank from b4-4 looks like a fucking human cat or some fucked up science experiment...
Ethan sounds like Trent Reznor.
Just chugging my way along the back catalog - this is by far my favorite. Hey I would have joined your boy band dude! next time hit me up, im in man!
Ethan looks like he bought his outfit from k mart
"It's like I'm in prison!" - said while getting a spray tan. WTF prison gives FUPA spray tans?!
This video
That song
I am now going to hang myself with a noose made of sea shells
"You know what bronze means? 3rd place. You ain't shit, nigga." - Filthy Frank
ive been watching ethan and hila videos for the past week
That edit at 2:12 hahahahahaha!
The songs actually lit tho
so you can look more blackface lol xD
Bro, your shits hilarious :P love it.. No daily neistat vlogs nd shaycarl is gone. I think your my new favourite youtube channel <3
Imagine it was real
You look like greg valintino before his arms exploded.  Google him... exact clone.
first thing in the morning and I'm right back into laughing my ass off.
He looks like feminist about to be triggered
when he told frank to go on tumble you pc bitch i literally spat cola out of my mouth
5:16 Fat idiot harasses lady by politely asking her how she's doing.
Hilarious
why didnt he do some autotune shit?
It was the Fake Frank! Real Frank would have joined.
How the hell does Hila film this and not laugh while filming
I think frank was poker facing really hard
Cool table for your pc. Where can I find one?
I've watched this video at least 100 times
HIGHLIGHTER WITH DOWN SYNDROME HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
7:11 a guy imitating superdave? stole his act atleast
"they wanna fuck the kid" lmfao
2:51-2:57
gonna make you cum tonight... over to my house
Ethan is like my comfort food, but without the food
ETHAN IS DUMBB THICCCC
I never thought hearing "til it looks like you have Jaundice" could hit me right in the feels liek that.
8:37 you aint shit N*GGA, ........bruh
I miss NYC h3h3
Legendary
Hila had fun that night ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
"Why don't you write a fuckin tumblr post about it, you PC bitch" 😭

2:18 Hands down the sexiest fupa I've seen.

Liquid Skin Cancer

Oh my haha the beanie was literally sold for 10 million 100 dollars
I think I see Donald trump' s brothers 😂😂😂
this is everything to me
2:17 thank me later.
Cringed so hard I'm a human pretzel #papabless
the bronzing girl was a total bitch
This is my favirote h3h3 video
Lmao aye he said "you know what bronze is?, 3rd place"
I want Ethan's song.
I won't lie that's pretty good!
Ethan is thiccccc
1:54 sounds a little reminiscent of something off Channel Orange
thats a viewmaster not vr goggles lol
I like how everything this circle of youtubers do is always one take.
Haahahahaha , those fucking lyrics man.
"i can see the kid watching me fuck" i cracked.
90s was Nirvana not this shit but damn this video is funny xD
That nose picking action at 4:01 though
Sometimes ......... I worry
That's not the real frank
She picked her Jose haha
Ethan is my favourite person
Holy shit I watched the beginning of the video after seeing the whole thing and in comparison Ethan looks great. Lmao.
ethan going ganguru on this bitch
i hit 200 subs in a month and now im famous
I definitely have those shorts
this is a great episode. as a sweet young canadian child i loved this band b44. truly a blessing.
Mid life crisis???
watch this on 240p to make it 90's
thats not a vr headset *cough
they're yellow
I'm a new subscriber and i must say, I love your videos. thank you for the laughs. :3
I love how he calls Hila "dude"
Yet another embarrassment for Canada
Wow I can't believe you did this. You made Schmoyoho look so horribly ugly by standing next to him as a Greek bronze god. Little inconsiderate to others busting out the pooka shell necklace next to others.
5:18 welp I'm dead
Still my all time fav H3 video
I would buy the song at the end
Ethan what happened to your back? You have a scar on your left shoulder blade
you know what bronze means, it means 3rd place, you aint shit nigga - frank
Their Dads must be so disappointed...
Ethan's self confidence is level God
lmao! 5 seconds in and I'm already in stitches. 😂😂
I'm crying
my favorite part about this video is that b4-4 were a 2000s band lol
your suppose to go orange not brown face XD
did anyone hear Frank say N!&&@
It's not black face :/
That black guy who laughed at Ethan hahaha
Please put this on iTunes
fupa shell necklace
ethan got the fuckin moves
fake frank
Frank said you ain't shit nigga listen closely. 😂😂😂😂
Ethan looks like some kind of prison bitch in this.
Ironic how filthy frank is talking about what is morally wrong
10/10 would fap again.
i need his level of confidence
This is the fucking greatest channel ever. I have no idea why they only have 3.4Mil instead of like 10Mil subscribers.
"let me to do da medium colour..."

OH GOD THE CRINGE
How cringy could they be? I can't imagen whats gonna be cringy in 20 years.

most underrated h3h3 video
I want to buy this as a single.
these 90s douchebags are honestly the most annoying fucking people i've ever seen, i think i have eye cancer
This Is By Far the BEST h3h3 vid. Frank, JonTron, all all the goofs and gaffs is all so good. From beginning to end this is filled with jokes.
looooooooooooooooooool the dance moves loooooool
Highlighter with down syndrome XD
Ethan you have a weird cut scar on your back that makes me worried.
LOL I used to love B44 the band in the thumbnail! They had like.. 2 good songs LOL
1:51 Why does this dude look like Akuma from Street Fighter though?
oh shit, thicc af boi
You go so far just to entertain, definitely best video lol
Im gonna make you jizz... cusi tonight
oompa loompas before drugs.
He sounds like DRAM in the best way
Ethan actually has a really good voice at moments. Sort of a Phil Collins TV on the Radio Style
For those of you just here for the song 11:49
That John dude looks like a fat Bieber
why ethan walks like he shit himself
That's actually a View-Master, not virtual reality.
Shit reminds me of Tim & Eric and I love it.
8:00 that guy on the computer does do crystal
wow ok... so in a few years when you're 40 it's obvious you're going to suck dick for views
dope shit..couldn't stop laughing dawg😅
showed my dad this and he said he is just jelus
11:29 Ethan's head looks like it was edited onto his head with computer software
Frank was like "You ain't shit, nigga!"
12:47 had me dying
That first guy looks like SoFlo.
2:24 
hoooooooooooly fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
that old-ass YTV logo. I remember that shit from when I was a kid!
"You look like an Israeli carrot."
BEST. LINE. EVER.
thats pretty bad when filthy frank says you have taken it too far
still my favorite video of h3h3
He became Fat Mike from NOFX
i love the subject of the video is the 90s yet this song was released May 2000
Absolutely brilliant!
died laughing at 3:47
2:15 made my whole day
"You really believe in me don't you?" 

His face is like "Do I...?"
You look like an israilie carrot
This to me is the greatest work of the genius that is Ethan Klein.
the music guy is super cute lol
oh my lord... i am holding back so much laughter at school right now lmaoooo
You know what bronze means? 
3rd Place
You ain't shit nigga
2:52 dude...the chick behind the kid who's stroking his back suggestively...that's fucked up. Super creepy.
They remind me of overgrown Oompa Loompa's
Ethan has bigger titties than Zoie Burgher before she made her boobs fake.
Anyone notice that their emulation of the intro to Get Down is an emulation of a song itself emulating Wouldn't it be Nice by the beach boys?
we need the 90s song
this is my favorite H3 video and I watch it once a week
"You look like an Israeli carrot" 😂😂😂
love the song
hey, that "jizzcuzzi"'s brilliant
the son is the best part
PLEASE RELEASE THIS SINGLE ALONG WITH "SOFLO LIKE ANTONIO!"
"Bronzed. Frosted Tips. Gentleman..." XD
Why would they use a little boy instead of a girl their age?? 🤔
born in 93

When filthy Frank started calling it blackface 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Israeli Carrot"

JonTron

Why don't you write a Tumblr post about it you pc bitch. Best line of the whole video.

Why does Ethan's head looks so big , it looks photo shopped?

I thought that audio engineer guy was Not Gay Jared.

I don't care what people say, this is the best youtube has ever been. crossovers are the fucking best.
Guys





I'll get down on you
"I'm gonna make you come tonight over to my house."

Greatest line I have ever heard. Move over Led Zeppelin!
I was born in '81.... fuck yeah I miss the '90's
i would be so scared to walk in the street looking that amazing. i mean i might get rapped
JONTRON
Hila's hair reminds me of my mum
8:37 hahah when you get caught in the moment and take it too far
This first guy instantly laughing at him xD
Schmoyoho looks like Edward snowden
so...cos h3 was talking to fake frank before the real frank came back does that mean h3 is an enemey of frank...oh shit jon too...
2:18 THE FUPA SLIP
damn that bronze
This might be the greatest sketch of all time
He looks like an older Tai Lopez after his Lamborghini's were taken away from him and he had to mortgage his house in the Hollywood Hills.
Dayum Ethan. You need to stick to making videos bruh. Y'all singing aint too good. I ain't hatin on yall but dayum. This new rpute don't suit you bruh.
this is amazing
Ethan + iDubbbz + Conan O'Brien +Clueless Gamer = Perpetual orgasm
Ethan + iDubbbz + Conan O'Brien +Clueless Gamer = Perpetual orgasm
My siblings always get mad when watch you're videos is not my fault that you guys are so funny keep it up Ethan & Hila when do chub n tuck they get jealous because my bold beautiful women.
Every year there is a 90s bar crawl and people dress like this. It was a simpler time...
Probably my favourite till this day!!!
P.S. Still sad abour jontron not joining israeli carrot though :(
Better than this 10's crap
Im balling in my jizz ..........................cuzzi
wow ethan good at singing i didnt know
Frank is holding himself very hard not to laugh
that party pooper commercial was hilarious
shouldn't Ethan be b4-2 because b4-4 has 3 people and 3 is before 4 so since Ethan is 1 person and before 2 is 1
When does the album drop?
he is b4 2
lol this song is from like 2003 but close enough i guess. canada is like 10 years behind soooooooooo it counts?
I want a full version of that song.
i think this is ethan's magnum opus...
I can't get over how ridiculous those dudes look!!! I mean are they serious with that tan? It's blowing my mind
my graduation is coming up. for the photo i was thinking of doing a V A P E N A T I O N. love your videos. and my whole school will know it.
lmfaoo!!! when frank says ' you ain't shit nigga!! ' 😂😂😂😂😂 Im dead
Real Frank would have done this, fucking impostor Frank
I was born with jaundice #TRIGGERED
Don't buy Acer products.
 "This shit just broke!" - Acer customer.
 "Faulty piece of shit!" - Acer customer.
 "It has been almost half a year, time to buy new Acer products, because they broke" - favorite customer of the Acer team.
I've seen this at least 30 times but it's just a funny each time . 
thankyou Ethan and Hila
Top 3 fave video. <3 "90/s hour" (!💕) PLEASE MAKE THIS A THING. ❤ A full hour of maybe some wardrobe changes, music video commentaries, bad and cool trend reviews, maybe some silly sweet personal flashbacks. A chill live one cut hang out hour of goofs, boogies, and ganders.
I F  Y O U  G E T  D O W N  O N  M E ,  I ‘ L L  G E T  D O W N  O N  Y O U
Where did Ethan get that gnarly scar on his back?
5:07 ethan lookin like a fancy pimp
Welcome to Ethan stealing the show from FilthyFrank and Schmoyoho. Coughing like an idiot when Frank is talking and dancing like an idiot when Schmoyoho is talking
Keep the poof
Ethan has a nice butt ;3
It is amazing in 1.25 speed. hahahaha
12:45
Man, you must've fucked up so bad when filthy frank tells you to get your shit  together
This is my favourite Anime
EH
omfg this is some fuuuunnnnnny shit
That is definitely me when i'm in a 90's band
Why is this song not on itunes or the google play store???
I'm definitely memorizing this song 😂 I love how Ethan sings the "puka she'll necklace" part at 12:43, just before the end 😥
time to bring the 90s back by ditching wifi, slowing our internet down to a crawl, and swearing at our other half every time they disconnect you from the internet to call their friend
that's a view master Ethan... a view master.
Sometimes, I'm legitimately concerned about Ethan's mental state.
Near the end he looks like a creepy Indian dude trying to score in the wrong decade.
6:39 lmfao
anyone notice how originally the song was originally in the trash? it was there for a reason.
Sup my dude



Read More
Real Frank would have said yes
im just dancing to the music dude, this isnt about you right now
You look like someone from Jersey Shore
By far the best H3H3 video, I was in absolute stitches throughout.
His body reminds me of Lena Dunham's
I'm waiting for that song to come out on iTunes
"Bronze is third place, you ain't shit nigga." Words to live by
My friend wondered how he could afford to tan, get a frost-job, and record music. I guess he never heard of ad revenue.
you need to make a new video like this ethan its a classic perfect video. keep it up proud of you
your hair looks so good
I wasn't alive in the 90s
2:22 #fupaleak
Ethan is one dedicated motherfucker. Mad respect for you man.
Did you ever asked OBJ joining you? 

http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/16733.png&w=350&h=254

wtf was this.
that junkrat haircut though.
"You look like a hi-liter with Down syndrome"
"you aint shit nigga"
Ethan, you forgot to tan your ears bro.
omfg I love it when he coughs
This dude just doesn't give a single fucking fuck
i played ethans song at the end of the video to my boyfriend and he said it sounds like coldplay
i wonder 
if this was real frank , what would he say?
Ethan, where did you get that fucking thunder ass from? Jesus Christ, it's exquisite.
THANKS A LOT ETHAN, I CANNOT get this damn song out of my head, when I go to bed... When I wake up...All I hear is the damn song!!! So what do I do...come back to this video to get the song out of my head but clearly that doesn't work!! It's been over a week. 😔🔫
This video😂
His tan look like Donald trumps tan
2:13 such a slept on cough
2:21 IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY LIFE RN
"nobody's getting down on me, I can tell you that for sure" is that a subtle hint that Hila doesn't succ?
Why don't you write a tumbler post about it you PC BITTCHH!!!!!! I literally, fell of the bed and died.
This is the best video ever
That man made a retards dream come true
i love this ee ee ee sound that is at the end of the song
Peaking at them shorts.

You should have gotten a golden grill to go along with the golden skin lol now that would have got some reactions
Stay in the sun till it looks like you have jaundice 
 oh my god i couldnt stop hearing that
I'm sorry Ethan I don't have time to watch this, I'm too busy watching friends.
YTV lol, did anyone else notice that?
the roast is real
You can grab my dic...tionary when we study tonight.
I can shove my fist into your box...ing gloves alright.
Real Frank would've supported him
Guys dont forget to support their other channel Ethan and Hila they recently posted a new vlog after quite some time away, they deserve our likes and views always.
What's blackface?
Who wants to come over? OVER AT MY HOUSE!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Your skin must hate you after this. Poor skin. :D fun vid!
they're slightly browner than me and that is not ok...
2:19 too much fupa, even for my tastes...
4:01 the lady was picking her nose
I came.... over for the frosted tipes, and stayed for the jizz... cuzzi?
Omfg Ethan you are amazing xD
Ethan looks sun burnt!
I wasn't born in the 90's 😐
He looks like Bobby Moynihan on SNL when he does the double chin
2:17 is just a masterpiece.
production value
Lmao that rude ass trumpet effect on the song is perfect hahaha
the non twin guy just looks like a demon from charmed i think
A fucking classic lmao
Everytime I watch videos like this, I wonder: How the hell do you have the courage to just do that?
you know it's bad when filthy Frank tells you to get your shit together
His carer is so sweet to him but honestly I think she's enabling self destructive behaviour 😒😒🙄🙄
I'm convinced that no one can ever beat this vid and the vape nation one, honestly it's comedy gold
hahaha hahaha the Jizz Cuzzy bit killed me. Awesome
Ethan looks like chell from portal at the end of this video
What'z the battle scar from dude
This is better than Vape Nation dude <3 love thsi video
He's like the Peter Griffin of real life
i dont even give a fuck, ethan can fucking dance dude xD 2:19
9:30 - Don't be afraid to be different. I am so inspired.
comment
What was that scar on Ethan's back?
fuck me... This is so funny. Love you guys!
I wish I had the balls of this madman. Papa Bless.
This song was released in 2000's not the 90's.
I like how you don't take yourself too seriously and just enjoy your life
He T H I C C
Pause at 4:02 ...thank me later
I now understand Hitler's views
8:39 lmao filthy frank says nigga
Getting this in my suggestions now...
@12:55 that "hey hey hey" is too funny..... And that last little hey at the end😂😂
ethan looks like a prisoner
"it was at this time he knew he fucked up" tries to put hair back on head
"theres probably like 10 girls sucking each of their dicks right now" so by that logic, each one of them has 3.33 dicks?
I have the same shorts 😂😂😂
it's called a viewmaster. jeez not hip Ethan, you should know that
You got a Nice ass ethan i Wish can i have that ass in me bed lucky hila
Boy bands in the nineties were the cancer of music
His head looks abnormally large with beautiful black face, i mean bronze face
My biggest thing is how does hila fuck him after all of this.
One of the classics right here
Ethan did the 100 layers of bronzer challenge before it was cool.
ethan could be a good singer if he tried
A HIGHLIGHTER WITH DOWN SYNDROME 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The greatest Canadian boy band ever! Gone sexual!!
2:18 for the ladies.
"... and I just looked like a fat, brokeass Justin Timberlake." 😂😂😂
It's not gay to have a thing for Ethan
11:55
Schmoyoho's awesome nd funny too hahahaha
man I need him to fill in that white spot in top corner of his forehead. it's. fucking bothering me sooo bad
No, don't bring the 90's back, bring the 80's back.
without a doubt the best video ive ever seen
This is one the greatest things I've seen
The youtube algorithm thinks that this is the best H3H3 video ever made.
Haha an actual 90s kid. Not someone born in the 90s.
I also have those pants 
Can't believe I dress like a celebrity
DOPE
0:22 Joooooo wahrscheinlich :'D
I Wana make you JIZZ....CUZZI WITH ME

Golden age of h3h3
Where's Ethan's beanie?
Wow Faze Rain is pretty good at singing!!
7:00 is this a recording of "TalkToFrank" drug addict hotline?
Why does Ethan look 10 years older than he is.
XD Frank ranting in the background
Does h3h3 mean hehe
10:54
Is was in the trash for a reason
I just turned 17 watching this video
It is the  most  Beautiful thing I have ever seen
omfg the first part i felt like i was in a christmas wonderland then it turned to being in a disco doing drugs wtf
when frank says no to you...you know it's fucked up
4:02 gross she's picking her nose
DIABETTEESSS
me and my buddy had a little debate over this on where this boy band came from and i was deeply sad when i realized they were from canada.  of course they're from canada. only the shittiest of the shittiest come out of canada .  from politics to boy bands . jesus .
ethan actually rocks that hairstyle tho hahaha
"You look like an Israeli carrot."
I did some research on this song. It's a Canadian boy band, and this song was #4 on charts at some point. Later, the band admitted that the song was, in fact, about oral.
I actually jerked off to the song. Came so hard. He was right tho.
The "Wah, what are you wearing?" from Hila sounds edited in
I have now watched this video around 6 times from it getting recommended to me.
12:51 is the first time I have ever seen the true love between Hila and Ethan, I can't even picture how much Hila is laughing her ass off behind the camera!
That poor man
Filthy Frank cameo, yes!
If you're like me click like before you watch the video because you'll be too busy clicking on the next video to remember.  But seriously who cares about clicking like?
The FUPA cannot be contained
The cough had me dying
"You look like an Israeli carrot" - JonTron, 2016
"I'm gonna make you come tonight over to my house."

Cause, ya know, that doesn't sound rapey at all.
best film ever made
b4 4 are some goons
My favorite h3h3 video
Anyone else watching this in the 90s?
Haha filthy frank is dad
Ethan: I'm gonna make you jizz...cuzzi with me
Me: dies
2017 still laughing
VR?  You call yourself a 90s kid and you don't know what a Viewmaster is?
Ethan's video has more views than the original.
Ethan made me realise that him and Hila have sex, that's like finding out your parents have sex.
#shark_jumped
Zina Ronaldo Ronaldo
4:21 is that a scar or a birthmark? O_o
the amount of "EY" in the music video made me die xD
2:39 look at his screen XD
actually the funniest h3h3 video
He sounds like Chris Martin
I'd tap that. I'm fucking serious, man, I would fucking smash Ethan.
4:01 the woman
It takes a fuck ton actually make me laugh out loud. I am death bed cancer cough-laughing like ethan non stop as I write this. You fucking rock my dood.
Im gonna make you jizz.........Cuzzi with me in the night
"You look like a highlighter with Down syndrome"
This is definitely the funniest video Ethan´s ever made.
Never laughed so hard
If my self confidence was as high as his lack of shame, maybe I would have a girlfriend.
"This is black face get your shit together nigga"
that song came out in 2001
He looks like a mom trying to be cool. His wife looks like a mid 90s snl cast member.
did anyone see the ytv logo
if Filthy Frank says it's not okay than it's beyond acceptable

lmao
8:30 
did he say the N word
don't judge it's a Jersey thing hahahah. God damn they're hideous
wow ethan was not fucking around when he said he doesn't give a fuck
IMMA MAKE YOU JIZZ
Dude I'm gonna memorize this entire song in case I ever meet Ethan because I saw him and idubzzz at a taco bell by my apartment
This video is why I haven't kms yet
GO TO THE BEACH AND FROANS YOUR TIPS

Can I have Franku's Skype lol
WTF why does he look like Sean Klitzner?
Wow, Ethan, great move. Keep it up. Proud of you.
Here for filthy frank really wish eathan and filthy frank make another video together.
I still can't believe this video was played on YTV. That channel is so kid oriented nowadays it's just unbelievable they were okay with this.
11:55
This video made me laugh so much. Love you Ethan and Hila!!
the glass of wine slays me
Ethan is friends with all of my favorite YouTubers
ethan is actually my hero after this video <3
Holy fuck, Ethan was looking just like Fat Mike with that mohawk.
crying
Omg I love the FilthyFrank bit, it made me laugh way harder than I should have.
you shold have asked idubbs, he would have totally been ok with blackface
8:25 when Ethan calls FilthyFrank a pc bitch lmao
I did this for my "Air band" performance in the 3rd grade...
"Why don't you write a Tumblr post about it you fucking pc bitch!" Yassss
12:00
11:50
11:48
is Ethan based in Toronto?
Go To The Beach and Frost Your Tips! the auto- tune of his voice was too good!
scarce is fat
Then Ethan died of skin cancer.
Yeah I think those guys in before 4 are super pedo. I know its very subtle, but I have a keen eye.
Deadass Ethan's singing sounds like the 2D from Gorillaz.
buy the album for 69 easy payments of $420.666 so call:
1-800-BRONZE-JIZZ
MY GIRLfriend saw this video as "Elton John IS a boy band"!!!!LOLOLJKJKLOL Now she fell in the SHOWER!!!?!?! #gone sexual!?!?!!!!
I don't see how three bronze douches with a wife beater t-shirt and shorts is sexy. Did people really find that shit sexy back in the 90s? Because apparently those bronze boy band dickbags think it is. Except Ethan. Ethan looks hella sexy in that look
Schmoyoho, JonTron and fucking Filthy Frank in the same video.
I just the biggest boner ever.
these dudes look fuckin freaky
ethan bradbrry
Wish I could like this more than once
I see Uranus




The planet
I can't. It's like Mr. T meets Bobblehead. 

http://gph.is/2ioe0VL
Love this type of comedy
"Aye Aye Aye Aye Aye"
he's looking like the tan verison of Ricky from trailer park boys
yeah but that vidoe was relased in 2003
Ethan:"Hila im gonna make you kum tonight"

Hila:"...yea-"

Ethan:"over to my house"
"You know what bronze means? Bronze means third place , you ain't shit nigha" 😂😂😂
I have no idea how many times I've watched this video, I love it
I'm gonna make you come tonight





In your vagina
Papa Franku senpai...

"Hila I'm gonna make you cum tonight" "*hila whispering* you are?"
filthy frank sounds like pewds
I want a full song xD
i actually love this song
7:00 now i know where Pewdiepie has his weird way of talking from
if he didnt cut the front he could have a nice mohawk
he's so damn lucky to have hila as his caretaker
What is the name of the music at 5:29?
Step 1 : Find Tim and Eric.
Step 2 : Put them in an h3h3 skit.
i have never laughed so hard at a video
is pewdiepie's deep tone sarcastic voice a parody of filthyfrank???
this is still my fav [h3]vid. like it even more than vape nation and the classic dj khaled reviews. the production value was just so high!
6:16 That's a fucking date, men. 
Jon x Ethan 4ever and ever, amen.
I bet real frank would have loved it
Dude this is the most cancerous video I've seen from [h3].

Hila would look really attrative as a boy tbh
#bringbackthereationvideos
This isn't Ethan joins a 90s boy band, he BECOMES a 90s boy band!! Btw I gotta say Ethan's singing voice is good as it is funny lol. This is great!!
If that was the real Frank, he would be down to clown.
do one from every decade.
This shit is too funny.
true comedy kino
You look like my uncle Jose
8:54
I'm gonna make you cum tonight...............................................................over to my house.
More than half the video was a sketch and I love it
I liked that song back in the days
you do not expect boy group sing how hard life is to little girl, that is just business
4:01 I wonder if she found a good ass booger
If Filthy Frank's telling you to get your shit together, you know you fucked up xD haha
#SaveHila
Holy shit the feels

What did John say at 6:40?
Israeli carrot?
Ethan. you simultaneously remind me of Tim AND Eric. it's really weird. I love it. I miss the dunnie.  I need him.

Every vid I watch of yours is better than the last.
I fucking love Ethan oh my god
Imagine IDubbbz Was In This Video
Holy Shit This Is Pretty Fucking Funny AF
It's not pedophile, it just the 90s
"you look like an Isralei carrot " ha
You need some fucking help Ethan . Hila is gonna leave u bitch. She can do a lot better
you take it to far
This was the best video of 2016 for me, hands down
his face looks superimposed on when hes at the studio and dancing. so weird.
7:22 he looks straight up like the dude from one direction
This is the best video ever
wait so.. was donald trump in a 90s boy band?
Ethan and Hila - you guys are saints. God bless you. Has there ever been a more perfect match made in heaven than you two? Maybe. But, will we ever see it in THIS lifetime? Maybe... Still, you guys are just the best things to ever happen to YouTube and you two really are the a perfect pair. As your carer, I can only imagine the everyday struggles Hila must face; feeding you, clothing you, taking care of your sporadic yet violent coughing fits, and getting you to put both socks on so that you can then put on your sandals. God. Again, what a saint.
I am so glad to have found your channel. It has blessed me in more ways than one and I just want to give a big, fat "Papa bless" to you, in return. Lately, life has been a real bradberry but your videos have lifted me up and I'm thankful for that. I've shared them with all 2 of my friends and they, too, have enjoyed your content. (You're welcome for sending TONS of new views your way!)
I plan to get one of your SICK sweatshirts. As a member of the Vape Nation, myself, I think I already know which one I'm going to get. (I asked my mom to get it for me for Christmas. She now thinks I'm insane.) 
Thank you for all you do and thanks for cheering me up when I'm sad and have run out of sodie pop. 
A merry Christmas and a Papa Bless to you and yours,
- Taylor
I love that cough!
He looks like Fat Mike.
Ethan has bigger tits than me
It's weird to see that the twins from B44 are now a couple of normal, serious singers called RyanDan. In recent interviews, you can actually see their embarrassment when someone brings up B44.
ICONIC
Thats the best video he ever uploaded :)
1:42   I spat food all over my computer screen
only 3 million views for this video? SERIOUSLY?
With them socks n' sandles, I don't think Ethan and Hila would be having any kids.
3:41 🙏
ethan do it for hila try KYBELLA
u could've save that hair for the human cake dawg
taking sarcasm on a whole new level
6:34
I dont do...you. Ok, you look like an Isreali Carrot.

#whenethanandschmoyoaresuchbadasslyriciststhattheirmockupsongisbetterthananactualattemptatmakingagoodsong
I wish I had the confidence eat ham has to go out into public like that lmao 😂😂
This whole video had me laughing so hard fuckin A 😂
the new frank episode means that was fake frank, so maybe now real frank will help you
the song is pretty good
I peed a little
2:18 THOSE DANCE MOVES THO 😂😂😂
roses are red
violates are blue
ethan is sexy
dat ass
this is like when joaquin phoenix tried to become a rapper
Are you Canadian?
If they ever make a live action "Bob's Burgers," Ethan needs to be on the short list to be Bob Belcher.
he's like a younger kenny hotz
Dude, I wanna buy this track.
Papa Franku
it's filthy prank
I'd buy music from Ethan. I honestly like his voice.
hahahaha those frosted tips!
Now both you and Sean have said the n-word on tape :/
Frank talks about how racist blackface is then uses the N word lol wtf
If they're B4-4, and there's only one of me,
I guess that makes me a quarter to one, after five.
Which is before four, I'm five.
I'm B-5, quarter to one.
Quarter to one o'clock, before B-5.
Before there was four, there was B-3,
which I'm after four, so I'm actually B-5.
And I'm just one dude, so I'm quarter to one. 
Quarter to one B5-5.
only 90s kids will remember this.
The Eh's xD
Where can i buy the track?
He looks indian
I'm gonna make you jizz...cuzzie tonight lol
fuck I love this video. I'd be so alone without you h3h3
What A Time To Be A Klein. Dropping 12/25/16
filthy Frank dropping that nigga bomb
I'm gotta make you "come" tonight, over at my house!

I totally lost it! XD
ethan knows exactly how to smash the juice out of a reaction till its dead and gone
Of course the imposter thinks it's a bad idea. The real Papa Franku would have joined the boy band in a heartbeat.
Haha fucking legend
looks like trump
"You look like an Israeli carrot."
Running in the 90's
12:45 😂😂💀
This is SSSSLLLLAAAAMMMIIINNN. I was eating this vid and I just spit it out and my god, this is amazing. Stay slamin my [ocks
classic h3h3
you look like a fat Bradley Cooper but its cool
please make a full length version of this song!
We need to purge Ethan's racist fat ass before he melts the polar ice caps and we have to built an ark.
2:23 Ethan looks like a big fat jelly bean with arms dancing
9:10 anyone else see that package ;)
The imposter was here
3:08 I like how Hila says a faint "you are?" after he says he'll maker her come
If i didn't know this was a goof and a gaff i would say this is a video covering an entire mid life crisis in the span of 13 minutes
I CANT BELIEVE you did not mention the sheer GENIUS of "B4-4"' as a 3- boy-Boy Band name.  I truly don't think Ethan understood the name. See , there are THREE of them. The number three is the ONLY number DIRECTLY "before" ("B-4") the number 4.  So they are "before four" - it's a name they likely sold as it was worth more than they cold make and touring was taking a toll on them due to insufficient tanning solutions in the tour bus.
In my opinion this is H3's best video.
I'm thinking jontron has some competition when it comes to majestic vocals now.
more sketches
all went down hill from here
we need lyrics
i've been watching your vids like crazy these last few weeks, you and Hila are awesome, and i have to give it to you, i would never walk the streets of NYC the way you do.... you have balls of steel or you just dont give a crap but either way you are the man...
I used to dress like that...unironically
When Ethan is talking about the puka shell necklaces he sounds so puffed from when you did the dancing
can you put this on itunes?
XD Frank disapproved
I would totally meme some twitch streams with this track lmao
lovin the kills e bot/ H lala
This is without a doubt one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  Quality quality content.  Great moves h3h3!
Still my favorite H3 video, so hilarious
They all look the same...
Ethan walking with a dick up his ass🤔
Filthy frank accepted my skype friend request lol
Ethan takes satire & parody to a completely other level.
what a time
#SaveHila
Best episode confirmed haha love all your work guys please fight through this youtube crisis we need ya
0:15 daaaam papa, u thicc
Why am I only just discovering this. I know this song is a joke... well I think it is - but I fucking love it!!! 😂
"I just look like a fat broke ass Justin Timberlake" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA #hotboi69
at the end you can see his cock and balls in his sweat pants
I love how you put a ton of work into your videos. Keep up the good work.
the song was good
Are they still going to make skits like this?
This is one of the H3H3 greats. Love what you do Ethan, keep on doing you!
God bless
It's fucking brillant
I wanna kidnap Ethan and use his skin as a body suit. Then, wearing his skin suit, make out with Hila.
Should'nt he get like flashbacks while being gased in that hall of coast chamber?
Are you serious rn Youtube? An unskippable 30 second ad in the middle of the video!? What kind of horrible torture is this?
alolan ethan
someone put the lyrics pls
I'm fucking dying lmaaooo
this is an early 2000's band, not from the 90's.  still funny though
I'm gonna make you jizz-          Cuzzi with me
This feels like a golden age h3 vid
3:08 
Hela: You are?
Hey ethan I just got a call from willie wonka he wants you back at the factory
Why don't you write a tumblr post about this you pc bitch
"You look like an Israeli carrot"
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Is it just me or does the darkest haired bloke look like Ethan Bradberry???
He looks like some Romanian, no disrespect to Romanians xD
That "you aint shit" at 7:37
Frank nor Jon wants to join -_- I can see Jon in a boy band but not frank
yay frank was in this episode :D
what the fuck was that math
2:25 u can see his pubes
My body just felt gross watching this video
,,If you get down on me i'll get down on you. I'll do things to you that you don't want me to.“
Literally just realized the two blondes are twins--
When you realize "get down" was released in 2000, making it not a true 90's song
I would love a sketch or a sticker of Ethan standing outside of the hairdresser salon with frosted tips drinking wine. #downtojizzcuzzi #makingyoujizztonight #wathcingthisforthetwentiethtime
How does Ethan go out in public like this what level of self confidence does he have
that bit at the end made mae want to kill myself
You can roleplay as a league of legends player too
JonTron's cameo was hilarious. This video brought me back to the 90's for sure. I actually shit a super nintendo.
HAHAHHAAH 😂😂
11:45
Should of called up idubbbz
hila makes the show
They're not from the 90s.
@4.02 your Spray tan lady is picking her fucking nose whilst she is talking to you bloke! bwhahahahaha :P
where can I find that music video?
Anyone else notice TJ Collins rockin the headphones in the background at 9:18?
im gonna make you jizz... cuzzi with me tonight! that shit had me dyin lmao
I'm going to make you jizz
Couzzi with me
The song by before four came out in 2003
"You ain't shit nigga. bronze is third place you ain't shit"
You made me cringe, congratulations.
Please never change the theme song!! I love it so much!
song is far too catchy. help
anybody just in love with the way Ethan walks?
I think after this video Ethan, you can release kleingina video :D
it's nice to see make a wish let this autistic kid dance and make a music video
how much does it cost for that slut to be in the bed ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
lmao that song came out in 2000.
Deserves way more  views
I'm a simple man, I see papa franku I press like
You look like a homeless homosexual at the end
Easily the best reaction video of this year.
I'm gonna make you jizz...cuzzi with me tonight
holy fuck. This is too good.
"You ain't nothin' boii bronze is third place"
Stay bronze, binocular boy
When h3h3's content was amazing. I really miss the old videos.
this motherfucker is so FUCKING hilarious. oh. my god....
you know what bronze means? it means 3rd place.
Their first album came out in 2000. They're not even 90's. I guess the early 2000's were longer ago than I thought if that was the music coming out then.
4:02 OMG that hairstylist COULD NOT be more hot
Backstreets back
Hands down my favorite episode.
I can't 😂😂😭😭😭😭😭 found your channel like yesterday so funny 💕
this is a god damn masterpiece.
love the 90s
hail trump

The shot of that cough at 3:47 just encapsulates Ethan

2:12, 5:14
why would anyone pay to be like umpa lumpa xD
It's a masterpiece favorite video
i miss the old ethan
I have a brain tumer

tanner spray isn't obly justified, it's JERSEYFIED
"Layered eh's become more distorted and weird."
You know you fucked up when even the Frank says  "You took it too far".
I'm gonna make you cum tonight.........................................................................................over to my house
H4H4

God damn, John's chin strap beard though.
1/4 to 1 b45
"2016 sucks, I can't get down on anybody and nobody is getting down on me, I can tell you that for sure". Lmfao
This video reminds me why I love you guys so much.
Ethan and Hila, this is your magnum opus.
Hmmm I see a scar on Ethan's back...
*marks that under useless facts about my papa
Wow, Ethan, great moves!
that guy laughing at 5:15 haha
lmao i died. i also loved that character breakdown and self assessment in the end
sik danz movz m8
jizz...cuzzi.....hahahahahahahahahahahahayhahahahahaha
jontron!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2:20 that dance tho.
5:28 what is dat mewzik?
Holy shit, shmoyoho's sound system is unreal
hilarious
''Yes, I have the sound that does that''
1:50 Patrice Wilson as a child
I always come back to this video for 7:22. Ethan's dejected face while he's being insulted is too good!
"You aint shit nigga" 😂😂😂😂
For how much dancing Ethan does he can't get rid of the fupa papa bless
you killin me dude.
.is it time to stop
Best H3 video 👌🏻
how does this not haav 10 mil views

#alllivesmatter
ethan is the funniest mofo ever man XD
lmao puka shell necklace tonight
#Ethans eyebrows
Anyone notice how one of the guys said the n word
When you shaved the side of your head, you looked like Fat Mike from NOFX
The real Frank would've joined him.
I saw this at least 20 times on vacation. I showed my mom and my wife and they couldn't stop laughing either! Hahahahahahhahahaba
You sing like daman albarn on heroin
ethan's thicc tho
the part before the tanning this sounds like the plot of a Disney movie
lmfaoooooo you look like a puerto rican mom
By far the best one
Ethan's head seems independent from his body around 11:30
i miss the old ethan, straight from isreal ethan
#1 song of this year
B44 is so ugly like my sister kept listening to this song and I would just get made because their ugly hair and tan
you aint shit niggar died hahahha
Jizzcuzzi tonight
Ethan has a nice ass... he's a bold beautiful man.
Ethan Looks Like George Michael
"Why don't you write a tumblr post about it, you fucking PC biiiitch!" LMAO
H4-4
he's got that sweet little tim heidecker bod
He looks like a Half-Indian/Half-Armenian child smuggler
they all look like trannies... lol?
"Spray them AIDS yeaaaaah!"
Guido
Those nike socks are actually dope
dayum ethan is thiccc 9:36
"Stay in the sun till it looks like you have jaundice." I fucking died laughing!!!
Lol you ain't shit nigga
What is that piano music?
he sounds like bowie wtf
"You're takin it way past." said the man who made a cake of hair and ate it, made a cake of other human stuff, and pitted animals against each other.
A little boy is wondering around the streets, picks up some VR goggles from the garbage, puts it on, and what do you see? A fuckin bronzed, frosted tip gentleman, talking about how he wants to FUCK you.
This video made me sad because I can't get down on anybody, and nobody is getting down on me, I can tell you that, for sure.
lyrics please xD
Do a skit with Tim and Eric
H3H3 predicted aloan dugtrio
papa bless
bro you are far beyond god hhhahahaahaa I watched all your videos in one day your a legend HAHAHAHAHAHAH
Dang Ethan, tuck your chub.
Michelle thinks she's special because she told Ethan that he had great moves? Please.
This deserves as many views as Vape Nation honestly
Ridiculous.
I love how Frank reacted to his Bronze face
Why do all the 90s people look so boxy and bulky? Those guys in b4-4 are a good example. It's almost like a whole extra layer of person is around each one. Sure clothes in the 90s are fat and shoes are fat too, but those guys weren't even wearing a lot of clothes.
He's got a nice ass
The part with frank felt like a crossover
12:46 probably the best thing ive ever witnessed in my life
MY GOD IM TRIGGERED! You Kids Don't Know The Good Comedy! Oh You Have Your Own Opinion? FUCK YOU! THE 80-90's WERE THE BEST!!!
DUDE @jontron is sick lol hell ya
The shit that they used to air on YTV. God I miss the good old days
I didn't realise American knew about B44. Cringy-est boy band from the late 90s. Thanks for the throw-back!
His outfit has my crying omfgggg I couldn't breathe
is this actually modern
PAPA BL3SS
when you realize ethan wasn't always 200 kilograms
i asked my mum for frosted tips ,and she said no saidly but if i did i would look so sexy
you need some dippity doo
that song is from 2000. it's not even fucking 90s. also, those shell necklaces were popular until the mid-2000s
that's a viewmaster, not vr goggles lol
I don't know why, but I see a lot of unintentional symbolism in the video and song. To be honest though, all this pretty much only applies in a western context, 90s Russia was VERY different.
This was totally the peak of h3
I'm gonna make you jizz... cuzzi with me tonight
2:12
11:20 you're unsettling
When Ethan's belly popped out, I died.
That cough at 3:44 got me dying
When I saw this on my recommended I didn't really feel like watching it for the sixty-second time, but...ugh whatever.
send me gifts on tuber simulator bitches my name is coolguycaloon
What even was that video
They look like fucking Jersey Shore avatars wtf
There was a reason it was in the trash,
I fucking lost it when he said he 'looked like a fat, broke ass Justin Timberlake'
"Bronze means third place, you ain't shit nigga"
He held up 4 fingers lol
why can't you like a video more then once there should be a super like. please YouTube 

papa bless
Franku was a perfect cameo
not laughed like that for a while, funny shit
Ethan: Hila, im gonna make you cum tonight...Over to my house, and then im gonna make you cum tonight...

Hila: (thinks) I seriously doubt that...
Ethan is thicc
it's so good his carer supports him through all this
@4:03 You lost something in there lady?
omfg frank And jon LOL! just this vid is amazing
Franku baby 💕💕💕💕
This video is genius it should have 10 million views.
lol u look like a new jersey douche bag 😂😂😂
9:28 That guy behind Ethan must be listening to that song. Keep the beat.
wow, the dedication in this guy, why does he not have more subs
12:46
"I'm gonna make you jizz-cuzzi with me tonight."
I laughed so hard neighbors called the fire dept saying their microwave just exploded
one of the best videos ever hahaha
Last.
It's a nice and beautiful song, i like it.
Nice moves
It's kinda crazy how all out Ethan goes for these videosXD mad respect
This and Vape Nation are my two favourite h3h3 vides. This is a mastapiece.
this is some funny ass nonsense. You guys are killin it. Why did Roman Atwood win best youtube comedian when this exists? This ONE video gets more laughs than all of Atwood's videos combined. Okok, Atwood is a good dude, and kinda funny, but he ain't H3H3 funny.
What is the song at 5:50 ?
The dream of the 90s is alive in Portland
the guy on skype looks like my gta online character :'D
Omfg I've been so depressed for a few days and this made me laugh so hard my stomach muscles hurt. Thanks H3. Papa bless. 🙏🏻
This is my favorite h3h3 video of all time, and I've seen almost all of them. This and Ethan Bradberry one's are the best.
10:21
Nice beyers
90s kids not 90s babies... who will get triggered
i quite like his hair like this
wow ethan, great boobs
The second papa franku tells you something is offensive....
one word...Commitment
This is my favorite video by you two.  It makes me laugh everytime I watch it.  Good Job!
I but the three of them bang each other all of the time
only good 90s bands where korn and slipknot
I ain't gonna lie Ethan got that WAGON
i wonder if they ever fuck?
The 90's looks weird af to me
He thicc af
Lololol he commits so hard I love it
I got an ad for the Book of Mormon on this wtf
ew
7:31-7:42 lmfaoooooo
was anyone else dying when he called O'Dell a Brazilian soccer player
Truly a classic h3h3 video, maybe even the best
I was born in the wrong generation. H3h3 is real music
If you search the song it actually came out in 2000.
2:20 NAKED FUPA
The Holy Trinity in one video: Uncle Ethan, JonTron, and FilthyFrank
This video made me upset for some reason
let's get real though that song was a fucking prime example of outsider pop
pls make more ethan
Spray them aids
video starts at 11:49
sounds like young thug kinda XD
what about edubs? (idubbbz)
when Ethan was my favourite YouTuber
when hes dancing in the studio his face is so much darker it literally looks like his head was pasted onto someone elses body dancing
fat
I feel like an idiot commenting on every video..but God ..my ribs are literally hurting from laughing..
"You fuckin PC BEYUCH"
Funniest video I've never seen honestly
when Frank says you ain't shit nigga haha
I am gonna make you jizz cuzzi with me tonight
0:14 YOOOO HE THICCCCC
When I clicked on this, I was expecting Ethan Bradberry 😂
Anyone else watching in 1999?
lol I died at the off sync "ayys"
He looks like Bart Baker's paralyzed 3rd cousin.
When Frank says there's something wrong with you, you know it's serious.
That base in the song
bronze means 3rd place
thi guy is the best youtuber ever
This dank song was released in 2003 though... Hot Fiya!
2:18

This was the last footage of Ethan before Hila filed the divorce papers.
"That's black face okay, that's racist!"
Are they going to celebrate a decade from now the 2010's? "ONLY 10'S KIDS REMEMBER"
The batshit crazy nostalgia you've tapped into reminds me of Always Sunny.   The gang descending into madness while attempting to recapture the magic of the 90s  would be a cool episode.
"You can bronze on these nuts faggot"
you look like an Israeli carrot
bro all your videos are fucking amazingly hilarious!!
you ain't shit nigga lol
2:16 nastiest dance I've ever seen
Ah, I forgot about the come over to my house meme, so dope
can u make another 1 of these please
This guy is so unfunny he actively depresses me...
b44 are weird
Papa Franku!
Lmao i swear it sounds like DOA Beach Volleyball music
why would u make Ur sister come wtf Ethan bad work, don't keep it up
Filthyfrank's comment at the end had me laughing uncontrollably
My lord
4:00 Anyone else notice that nose pick?
I wanna buy his song.
this video was fucking gold
do more collabs with filthy
Love it.
Is this the new Gorillaz song?
7:03 but he's an impostor.
lmfao
THUMBS UP IF YOURE WATCHING IN 2016!
he looks like hugh mongus
haha he is so good at pulling a straight face!
Does he look like his head is huge when he has the tan?
ah man where can i download that fire???
Who The Fuck Is That Black Woman
waiting for obvious tim and eric crossover episode
This is fuckin' great dude
2:12 
Closed caption
Coughs in 3d
do you think that all weird looking gross humans on the NYC subway is just making YouTube videos?
that song is actually pretty catchy
Ethan can really not sing
the 80s is the shit
2:21 I'm on point
+h3h3Productions whats the scar from if you don't mind sharing?
is this song on Spotify
4:02 okay.
Ethan, THAT'S NOT FRANK! THATS NOT THE REAL FAAAAAANK
Hilarious!!!
Ethan sounds like Bowie
Why do they look like Second Life models?
i love his shorts. on point ethan
Ethan isnt a quarter to one... hes SEVEN THIRTY!!!!! (OOOOHHHHH DAAMMMMNNN!!) Also, cant believe Ethan didnt show the ridiculously high pitch these guys get to later in the video
with that brown skin he reminded me of my Indian uncle like in mumbai
It's sad to realize that most people probably think of boy bands or bad poppy R&B instead of college rock or first wave grunge when they think about the 90s.
"You look like an Israeli carrot."
Best JonTron line.
i actually liked Ethan's song very much :(
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z

Notice anything? The alphabet you retard.
Messed my back up laughing at you last night and tonight I've fucked it up even more by watching this shit which sent me over the edge.
i can't believe he did this
Hey man. Remember that harambe video yo made?





Kill yourself.
Not even joking Ethan is so fucking         T H I C C
I have never truly enjoyed a youtube channel as much as h3h3
kinda gross how he wants to make his sister cum
Israeli highlighter carrot with down syndrome.
"You look like a fat, broke-ass Justin Timberlake."
Ethan has hair?
are you actually fat mike from nofx?
Where do I buy Ethan's new hit single, "Making You Jizz Tonight"? I must know.
he walks like he has a permanent groin rash
"You Ain't Shit NIgga" 
- Filthy Frank 8:37 2016
2:56 ohh, that is such a dope line
Prolly my favorite h3h3 video in a whilw
"You look like an Israeli carrot" 
-Jon Tron 2016
"You look like an Israeli carrot" and "a highlighter with downs syndrome" jonhtron, filthyfrank and ethan are the magic trio... like the fucked us powerpuff girls
if someone asks me what h3h3 is im sending them this video
Ethan sounds like he could be in Tenacious D honestly.
The funny thing is that this song was made in like 2003 or 2004 not the 90's lol
Someone called Filthy Frank PC? I thought I'd never see the day.
ethans butt is so cute you guys.
I'd buy this if it was on iTunes
Lmao Ethan's song made my day
surely the best h3h3 videos.
I mean, it have the best jokes, the crazy aspect, guests...
And if you get down on me I'll get down on you I'll do anything that you want me to I'm going to make you come tonight over to my house
He could do some Blur
That was one clever in-ur-endo in that song. God bless. Burnt Chrysler is fat.
I want to make you jizz... 

over to my house
Jon would look amazing with the boy band look
oh papa franku
Your like my mom! Always changing races!
HE LOOKS LIKE FUCKING FAT MIKE FROM NOFX HOLY SHIT
Israeli carrot
They bleached their hair when they should have been drinking it.
When Franku tells you that you "look like a fucking idiot" ;_;
also it was released in 2000.... but they are were definitely before their time.
Sadly these trolls were made in Canada
instead of adapting 90s boy band you could try out what was happening in Norway in the meantime...burn churches, wear black and white make up, worship the dark lord and make music that has quality worse than when recorded with a phone...also known as black metal
but why spellchecker
vale Nash
Ethan you outdid yourself this video 😂😭
Omg
you ain't sheet niggu
"how about you write a tumblr post about it you fucking pc BITCH!"
The self-conscious shirt correction during the dance at 2:23 nearly made me shit myself laughing... no wait... no, yea I actually did. It's in my socks... fack.
Everytime I feel like my age is bad, I'll just watch this. xD
fucking dying laughing pls send help
I almost passed out from hyperventilating hahahahahaha
laughed way too hard at this one, h3h3 quickly becoming my fav youtube channel XD
jizzcuzzi

Haha ethan is best

His band should be named "Ethan and the Slamberries" lmao
"you look like an Israeli carrot"
Not gonna lie Ethan has a nice ass

This video is legit mentioned in the Get Down wikipedia page. xD

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Down_(B4-4_song)
Man, 1990s were scary.
you hate yourself don't you?
who else loves ethans dance moves?
This song came out in 2003...
in the song he sounds like Bob Dylan mixed with mark from the key of awesome..... with downs of course
5:10 that is gold
😂😂😂😂
You know what bronze means... Third Place







You Ain't Shit Nigga
Somebody need to tell Ethan he's horrible at physical comedy
😄😂😄😂 omg i couldn't stop laughing!!!!
I have that same exact "hey" sample. I mean, it's royalty-free, I'm sure everybody does. But that doesn't stop me from being proud.
Idk why but I think Ethan looks like a 50 year old lesbian in his final form XD
Jizzcuzzi with me tonight
Make full varison of this song
if this is what Satan looks like. I will devote my life to becoming immortal (it's guaranteed that I'm going to he'll when I die)
Ethan got Morchael'd so hard man
Lol
"You look like an Israeli carrot."
The video would have been much better if he got a 90s boombox and played that dope schmoyoho track out on the sidewalk in public
B4 4? So 3?
frank: you aint shit nigga LMFAO
This is genius
One of Ethan's best vids.

Yo does anyone else think Ethan's singing and song were actually pretty god...just me????😶😶😀

I had a dream last night that Ethan and I dropped acid at a b44 concert.
I can't stop watching this video. send help.
someone gif Ethan dancing to this
Did I see balls or an oddly angled weiner at the end there?
This video is a miracle.
OMG. When he looked through the google things and you saw the dude just start singing without hesitation.
2:22 don't hide away the fupa!
2:22 don't hide away the fupa!
Tell Jon to shave off that fuckin' chinstrap, please! Or at least grow a mustache. Muthafucka lookin' like Isis
I couldn't stop laughing 😂😂😂
This song was released in 2003.....
It's still crazy that these guys were considered attractive.
You are a fucking legend
Why does his head look so big every time he dances
That is the most I've laughed in a while. 10/10
it sounds like they said, "I'm going to make you cum over my ass"..
0:15 Damn, Ethan thicc af
The girl at 4:00 picking her nose?
i admire you not everyone laugh about himself like you :|
12:19 HOW HE SINGS VOLLYBALL OMFG
a fat broke ass justin timberlake😂😂
If filthy frank says you're taking it too far



You seriously fucked up
I'm so fucking dead
I feel a bit sick.
"you look like an Israeli carrot" lolol
this might be my favorite h3 video
You know you've made bad live choices when filthy frank tells you "get your shit together"
Frank is the best part of this video
I can't stop coming back to this video. I think it gets funnier every time...
12:10 was 🔥( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
needs more straw.
By far my favorite video from Ethan!
2:12 "AHUEHHH"
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
😂😂😂😂oh shit frank 😂😂😂😂😂
did that lady pick her nose on camera? omg
best video I've ever seen o baby i just laughed so hard I shit my pants
9:12 you look like a guy who would wear a shirt that says, "no gag reflex"
I love how frank is trying so hard not to laugh.
I want to see the behind the scenes of this
The real papa franku would have joined the band.
i read this as 'Elton John joins a nineties boy band' oops
Holy shit he went all out on himself for this video.
To this day, this is still my favourite video on this website.
I'm almost 3 quarters the way through and I can't handle it any longer omg
Look at Ethan in middle school, now compare him to now.
Filthy frank and jontron. made my day
you look like a fat new jersey news guy
I was fucking dieing when Frank told him to get his shut to gether
best boy band in the 90's is................... METALLICA!
he's actually really  good at singing
Israeli carrot
I still can't believe you actually went through with this, Ethan.
Ethan this is the content we h3h3 fans enjoy, videos that took work and didn't use a tripod... please stop uploading content that only takes a day to produce because most people don't want to watch bad content
That chub and untuck had me cracking up! Work that fupa bah!
B4-4 is from 2000
Just got kicked for mic spamming Ethan's song on TF2
That's not the real Frank. We know.
7:14 I wish that he had said "Ethan it's time to stop!"
90's Ethan's singing sounds like Mark Hoppus
So... anyone else notice that isn't actually the real Frank?!
fucking legend
you may have stopped emulating Tim and Eric but your singing voice never stopped sounding like them
He looks like Donald trump with the spray tan
i fucking lost it when he showed up at the tanning salon with  printed pictures of these guys
I like how the guy who made a vomit cake, human cake, and hair cake is telling a guy with a tan to get his shit together
one of the best videos i have ever seen. proud of you
this video saved my life
i remember at 5:59  when i took  the first chemo all of my hair was falling just like that
LOL this is almost on par with Vape Nayshe!!!! God damnit Ethan you are truly a legend.
0:13 dat gap
I laughed so hard my whole fucking face hurts. 😂😂
Bronze is Latin for black face
Jon cameo! :D
Lmfao Frank almost loses it at 7:40
5 secs too short
Looks like he bathed in ketchup
dude I would actually buy Ethan's album if he had one! I've listened to way worst shit honestly so yeah I kind of liked it😂😂
These were the first trumps
Fucking shit that was funny.
This is the greatest dance sequence of all time! 2:18
If you released that track in the 90s it would probably chart.
what the fuck
I still think this is funnier than Vape Naysh
put it on itunes
We need a reaction video from b4-4 or have a B4-4 reunion with H3H3
Dat chub'n'tuck
Why is their skin colour orange?
I kinda like this song
He is rocking that chub and tuck so hard dood
i have this on loop
That tan
h3 deserves waaaay more subs he's halarious
When Ethan put the ball of hair he had cut off back on his head and tried to tape it back on...I lost it!!! XDXDXD
2 MILLION
I have crippling depression
Just a small box of potatoes on their table
His face during the Skype call😂😂😂
H3h3 is my new favourite channel
He looks like a homeless diabetic George Michael.
you can't bronze the pain away.
Ethan's dancing is so unbelievably rythmatic. The studio end part is exactly like 90s dances.
those boys are gonna start SLAAAAAAAAAAMIN' on you tonight
when he said there fucking the kid my face turned to red and im black
Wow! Ethan, great boobs, keep it up, proud of you!
you got a good base coat.
where can I buy this song?
"Get Down" was actually released in the year 2000, not quite the 90's not good enough Ethan, bad moves, stop it, dissapointed in you.
They all look like ETHAN BRADBERRY
Vape Nation 4 Life... Real talk!
Dude, you had it 99%...all you were missing was the pencil line chin strap. That chin strap would've mastered the look!
Anyone hear Frank say nigga
I could watch this video 12941 times...
this is modern art
You look like an Israeli carrot
Someone please make a gif of 2:19
5:30 "...I just looked like a fat, brokeass Justin Timberlake" lmao
I think I know what Ethan's band should be called "h33" (like b44)
Ethan kinda looks like a schlubbier, hairier version of Tim Heidecker
I think u need a little more bronzer
Lol I kinda felt bad when frank was yelling at Ethan
Haha that wasn't VR goggles lol, it was a ViewMaster, obviously I am a 90's kid, born 1991, I had one of those stupid pieces of shit, you used to get them free in cereal boxes, basically the most primitive form of stereoscopic 3D you can get lol

Step4: Enjoy
gasp* fake franku led Ethan away from the glorious boi band lyfestyle
This is by far my favorite video of yours. I have watched it like 5 times lol.
I was really hoping with the 90s theme and the "I'm sick of being me" joke that he would pull some Type O Negative shit. Anyone feel me?
One of those has to be prank invasions father.
Is filthy frank secretly Omar Isuf?? Or maybe Brady Brosef???
This guy needs his own Comedy Central show
boy came out of that spray tan looking like a fat aziz ansari
he thicc👌😩🔥💦
I think you are probably the only youtuber that has cut his own hair more then once for comedic effect. And this is why you are my favorite YouTuber!
Ethan doesn't have that bad of a voice, i'm dead ass
"doot"
SPRAY THEM AIDSS
When Jon looks at Ethan, he's probably wondering how his life has come to his friend becoming an orange muffin.
I lost the track of how many times I've listened to that song at the end, make Ethan a singer
That dance was so powerful the chub untucked itself
His dance at 2:23 xD
This is a surprisingly, well thought-out, surreal documentary.
Where are these kinds of episodes anymore?
T H I C C
This video is Ethan's Apocalypse Now.
90'S Overdose yeah!!
This is only second  best to Vape nation.
7:17 IT'S TIME TO STOP, ETHAN
7:20 he sounds like Pewdiepie. completely!
ey where do you get your garries from ethan I want some
MISSING PART OF THE VIDEO 

ETHAN: is this too much (with black face, super saiyan hair)
FILTHY FRANK: IT'S TIME TO STOP!!!!!!!!!!!
lol
Go to the beach and frost your tips!, stay in the sun til it loos like you have jaundice! best line
You can see Filthy Frank trying his hardest not to crack up.
but this song came out in the 00s
I've gotta say, I completely agree with filthy frank, you took this waaaaay too far. I mean, that's taking dedication to a whole new level. That being said, I really enjoyed this video and your content in general so keep it up!
Ethan. You took it too far this time. Good vid tho
omg hus giddamn eyebrows
This is the best video I've seen from them so far
Ethans song= life
If you go down on me, I'll go down on you
I have a crush on filthy Frank, but oh well, we all kinda do
Thats how you know thats fake frank, real og frank would get down on you no problem
8:04 i come back after almost 4 months just for this part
Sorry about this but why does Hila look kinda strange..?
video on trial
I found this from EDM Lyrics
Ethan kinda looks like Moo Snuckel's GTA character
that shit hot af
I think the original video is not available anymore
I sexually identify as an African Asian gendersoda who wants to be dominated by h3h3
funniest thing youtube has to offer.
6:58 ITS NOT THE REAL FRANK
Wright  a tumbler posts about it you fuckin pc bitch......>>>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhahahahahahahahahahah
This is by far his best video
how does he live wiht himself
The cringe is real.
Ethan, you hangin out with them pineapple boys again?
I'M GANNA MAKE YOU COME TONIGHT, OVER TA MAH HOUSE
I have cancer.
He looks like Fat Mike from NOFX.
"BRONZE MAKES THIRD PLACE YOU AIN'T SHIT NIGGA!" AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ethan is t h i c c   😫😫😫💦💦
I literally can't breathe. I'm dying. No wait I just hanged myself.
ethan stop vaping please it is bad for you!
Damn daddy material 😍😫👌🏻
You look like a fucking highlighter with down syndrome...I fucking died.
this guy is a legend and always has more views than subs
who is that guy called with the deep voice and hat and glasses
did anyone else just realise that the person that says "Wow Ethan Great moves! Keep it proud of you" is Michael Obama
You look like Trump's lesbian mom
What am I watching-
This was H3H3's peak, I feel like. The stuff they made after this was good, but this was like the best video they've ever made.
To be honest I want the 90s back as well
lmao N-Bomb at 8:38

You could tell frank was so close to breaking character when he sprayed himself
I couldn't stop laughing!
I cried :(((
he could be a actual sing
Did I just watch the best thing ever.
8:37 "You ain't shit nigga"
Pause at 2:21 lol
So glad I missed the 90s by 3 months

They're Canadian too...
Im on a H3H3 marathoon today. Tucking my Chub
What are they ... FORTY???
I totally lost it at that conversation starting at 11:15
i'm crying right now this is so funny
THIS, THIS, is quality YouTube content!
The things Ethan does for us
if kamikaze /failure/ frank tells you to act right -- a guy who tried to pass off fucking mice as crawdaddies in a race -- you better take a long look at what you're doing with yourself.
Watch his head at 11:25.
this is probably my favorite video of all time

i had it in background while playing dks3 for 6 hours
I'm scared his next video's going to be a sniff film or something.
that track was fire
why does one of them look like soflo
"Yeah I'll think about it but its probably a 'no'..................no" Jon -6102
Still better than jacob satorious
"I noticed you have a surgical mask on.........should....should I have one of those on?" -Ethan 2016
aye
ethan has a really good voice xD
just bought that same akg mic he has
how do you only have 1.8mil subs you should be at like 5 lmfao, this vid got my sub for dure
papa frankuuuuu!!! oh man that was an amazing surprise; that just warmed my heart        = ]
Ethan has such a dad ass
what the fuck dude

this guy is fucking mad
From the GARBAGE
You can never take it to far. NEVER!!!
"Duud"
bronze means third place you ain't shit nigga~ quote from filthy frank
Jersey as fuck, son.  GTL all day errreday.
lol remember how in the 19 hundreds a trend would last like 10 years now a trend lasts like 10 weeks and we move on lol
LMAO frank is funny as hell
I thought he was rubbing BBQ sauce on his face when he met up with Schmoyoho
ethans hair actually looks kinda good.
And you know hundreds of teen girls all across Canada got down to this song and those lovely lovely tans and frosted tips mmmmmmm
"IT'S TIME TO STOP!"
schmo has so much bass
When you fully understand the situation youre in
https://gyazo.com/5a71648133ee5bf57e1fbd011c213d3b
JESUS CHRIST, YOU'RE OVERWHELMING ME WITH YOUR SHAMELESSNESS
haha "do you know what bronze means? it means 3rd place .. you aint shit nigga" lmao
2:18 OMG IM DEAD XD FORREAL
I miss the 60's music and the years itself
A broken man
I respect Ethan so much for walking around like that.
spray them aids yeaaaaah
I've watched this video atleast 10 times in the past few days,

I've been on youtube since 2006.


This is one of the best video's I've seen in my life, if not the best, we love you Ethan <3.
I'm DYING OF CRINGE POISON
I love this man, he makes me proud to have a big gut
My adopted brother is 10% black so I can say nigger now.
I miss the '90s?... Ehmmm... Well... Sort of?... I've been watching the old Power Rangers series again... lol
I mean, it's frickin' stupid now, but it's still fun. Unlike that shit they make for kids these days.
Man, I remember when my homeboy NL made a reference to b4-4 in one of his binding of Isaac vids
3:25 Personal Space Guy
This just might be the best video on YouTube.
Funniest video i've seen in my life, cannot stop laughing. All hail the meme lord Ethan. His comedy completes my life.
12:50 ay ay ay ay ay AY AY AY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYayaYaYAYAYAyAYaY
lmao omg h3h3 the movie heheehuhahuhehah
eating honey grahms and I just inhaled them when was just standing outside the building
This song was Made in 2003
how long did it take to make this video?
some true dedication
YOU CAN SEE HIS DICK 9:09-9:12
this is fucking hilarious
10:42 made me die
This video was actually made.
But this wasn't the 90s, Get Down was released in the year 2000 and the video 2003.
LMAO.. Frank at 8:37
frank annoys the fux outta me
Spray dem AIDS, yeah~
WTF how fast does Ethan's hair grow????
If I'm gonna go it alone, I better do it right. With the only boys I ever loved. B44. And if they're before four and there's only one of me, I guess that makes me a quarter to one. After five. Which is before four. I'm five. I'm B5, quarter to one. Quarter to one o'clock before B5. Before there was four, before there was four there was B3. But I'm after four so I'm actually B5. And I'm just one dude, so I'm quarter to one. Quarter to one B5 5.
"Bronze means third place. You ain't shit, nigga". Papa Franku Bless.

He looks like a giant orange bobble head
Okay this is really weird, but I was wondering... does anyone think that h3 sounds like a meeseek from Rick Morty? Like when he's singing, he sounds a bit like one.

ETHAN GONE TOO FAR DUDE
LONG LIVE TO THE VAPE NATION!!!!!
the song is from 2003
Man. I wonder how that kid felt after the video shooting when he got pink eye from using a toy from the garbage can.
At 11:30 Ethan looks like he has a giant head. Can't stop laughing. He's like a cartoon character.

Frosted fucking TITS
Filthy Frank made this video:
"You look like a highlighter with down syndrome."
Ethan can walk around like this but gets embarrassed when picking up women?
Ethan has no shame.
The lip sync is sooo bad in the music video.
It was in the trash for a reason
2 out of the 3 look like that soflo bitch
1:56 till the end I love you h3h3
He out Heideckers Tim Heidecker!
I would honestly love to see a Boy Band starring h3h3, Jontron, and FilthyFrank.
this is disgusting.
too disgusting even for filthy frank? wow
"You look like a highlighter with down syndrome."

Omg both papa and jon... I feel blessed.

i was born on 2000.
i was born on 2000.
Are we not going to acknowledge how fast Ethan is always able to grow his hair back after these shenanigans?
haha at 5:45 he looks like fat mike. Awesome.
Bronze means 3rd place nigga
I know it's Ethan's thing to cough and "ECH" like Jon and all, but I feel like lately he needs to take some Pepto Bismol
That song and music video is so cringe worthy!
Nsync confirmed. Another New kids on the block fucking Backstreet. (I hate boy bands)
OH SHII TIME TO GET MY SOCKS ON AND PUT MY SANDALS WITH MY SOCKS STILL ON ITS 90s TIME !
How'd he get that scar on his back? I believe it's on his left shoulder blade. Where'd it come from? It looks surgical.
He looks like if Donald trump was homeless
This is the best h3h3 video so far
1:13 does his head look larger then normal
Where did Ethan get those pictures on the side of him from?
"I'm gonna make you cum tonight"...well...ok
Omfg, I laughed so hard when he started doing the song. At first I thought it wasn't going to be good, but holy fuck that was hilarious.
Imagine how awesome it would be if jon and frank joined ethans band
Why do I dream this every night?
Can I get Ethan's song on iTunes?
by FAR my favorite h3h3 vid
cles
ti
tes
Holy shiiitttt.. Fuck.. I havent laughed this hard in a long time.. Fuck... Lolol
Express yourself NWA, that's a good meme
is there a full song of that song at the end? Would pay for it tbh
Pink Guy feat. Ethan Klein would be gr8
5:45 damn Ethan you actually look hot too bad you fucked everything up seconds later dude
"YES DUDE! That's the nineties! A little boy's wandering around the streets, picks up some VR goggles from the garbage, puts it on and what do you see? A fucking bronzed frosted tip gentleman talking about how he wants to FUCK YOU!"


THAT LINE KILLS ME
what's the song at 5:30
This song is a fucking jam
That illeagal U turn at 12 minutes tho xD
Ethan, please listen to me for just a second. 
I want you to know that you make art on a level the world has never known.
this should be the new darude sandstorm
hey yo, this isn't actually Frank! glasses and hat is papa fakeu
This is just amazing...

Papa franku
ethan has a big ass head
I constantly have "Pooka shell necklace tonight!" playing in my head all day...thanks Ethan you frosted tip Israeli carrot
You look like an Israeli carrot
Those yellow pants OMG lmao I can't
I was brought here by b44
If I'm gonna go it alone I better do it right, with the only boys I ever loved, b4-4. and if they're b4-4 and there's only one of me, I guess that makes me a quarter to one after five which is before four, I'm five. I'm b5-a quarter to 1, a quarter to 1 o'clock b4 b5, before there was four, before there was four there was b3 but I'm after four so I'm actually b5 and I'm just one dude so I'm quarter-to-1, quarter-to-1-b5-5.
That moment when you get cancer.
"I can see the child watching me fuck" haha
he looks like the bass player from NOFX....
lmao when he pulls his pants up so high that shit is priceless
this dudebis absolutely hillarious
He's looking like Donald trump lol
Is it just me, or does it seem like Ethan could become a pretty good singer with a few lessons? 😂
"I'm gonna make you come tonight... over to my house. Then I'll make you come tonight."
I've watched this video steady for 3 days straight and it's really not worn off yet.
10:36 ROFL
Not wanting to trigger you Ethan, but what's that scar on your back from?
7:59 frank trying not to crack a smile
where can I get that song in the end.  Jesus fuck it's good.  So 90s so fresh
Gross he said he's going to make his sister cum 😖
This is more a story of one man's slow descent into nostalgia based madness than it is making fun of how fucking dumb the 90's were.
why do you look  so much like kevin love 😂😂😂. great video btw
8:30 "You know what bronze means? It means 3rd place. You aint shit nigga" LOL
kinda sounds like Mark hoppus +44 era
did filthy frank say nigga at 8:37?
JONTRON!!!
Frank calls it blackface, but then uses the N word ok then.
The song was trap influenced
Ethan has no shame, holy fuck. Some of he funniest shit, I've seen.
Oh fuck, I almost had a heart attack, when you was standing outside the salon with a glass of wine.
h3h3 is just a pov of hilas day to day life
"you aint shit nigga"

-papa frank
"you look like an Israeli carrot" best line ever
Holy shit the Ethan & Shlohmo collab is lit
those guys are literally living carrots with frosty hair
I'm gonna make you cum tonight ... Over to my house .... Lmao
Like an autistic Randy Rewman
That song (b4-4 Get Down) wasn't made in the 90'sit was made in 2001
It's a View Master moron. Not VR.

How do you have 1.5M subs? Oh right... You Tube is populated by your fellow morons.
"They wanna fuck the kid. And I really identif- well I don't wanna say identify" 

Most underrated line in the whole video
the lady tanning him picked her nose... 4:02
I actually love ethans voice singing hahahah
I was here before 100k subs
4:02 Diggin' for gold
Ethan literally getting cancer from youtube.
Ethan: Hila, I'm gonna make you cum tonight.

Hila: ;) ;)

Ethan: Over to my house.

Hila: :(
2:22 Fupa Leak
Tim and Eric?
pliz h3 react to this video five lights go out its fuckin gringy
Damn Ethan u thicc dawg.
ethan has a chunky ass
thats not even 90s, thats like 80s or 70s
8:33 lol you can see on his face after he didn't mean to say it, surprised it made the cut
Why do they all look like SoFlo Antonio?
I think he might've gone too far with this joke.
So that's where the Guidos came from. Except for the one guy who looked like a bronze vampire from Buffy.
OMG this was amazing, laughing so hard... why don't you write a Tumbler post about it you fu**ing PC bi**ch! 
ok, subscribed
'WOW! Ethan, great moves! Keep it up, proud of you!'
I'm gonna make you eat shit





Shitartky mushroom
#anythingforviews
Sometimes I come back just for the song at the end
I love that he keeps calling his chick dude, and also his gut.
He endures so much for us
"Highlighter with Down syndrome" lmao
cancer cell
@ 12:18 I like what you're doing with those socks there, what do you call it...? Flood protectors? Soft armored boots? 3 inches of Cosby? Sunday shin dress? Parkour the socks? Leveling up? No dragging tha swag? Cuff n stuff?
try stop me from Bronzing dude spit..Cough...vomit hahaha
actually i like your Song More than the Song of those guys
ARE YOU CRAZY? ARE YOU OUTTA YOUR MIND
is he spooky scary skeletoning us?
4:02-4:03 she picked her nose lmao
Bronze frosted tip LMAO
Hopefully one day when my friends and I are adults we can do something like this
"You look like a highlighter with downs syndrome."
this is a very rare type of comedy. It is funnier the more you anticipate it.


Top kek Ethan, very well done.
What the fuck is the woman putting in her nose at 4:01
The cringe... it hurts. I LOVE IT!
don't let Numbah 2 get you down
i atched a fucking 54 miute ad before watching this
I love their tank tops underneath their tank tops.... fucking flawless.
this guy is the definition of impulsive

This is definitely one of your best videos ever.
#Flupaslip
Frank said u aint shit nigga at 8:36
He looks like a lesbian
ha another great vid. loved the song, esp the bit with my poca-shell necklace on 2night!
Anyone else already know about these guys from NorthernLion?
hila has a great poker face. i picture her behind the camera playing dumb. the music producer is looking back and forth between the two of them waiting for one of them to crack, but they just go deeper into character and lay it on even thicker.
i can see a kid watching me fuck. i lost it lol
Ethan sounds like the guy from the flaming lips
idk
I shit my pants watching this
Man, 1990's times were scaary
Right when he said he had one more friend who was desperate, it switched to an ad about the young messiah. Jesus is desperate
Funniest YouTube channel, hands down!
You know when the girls were touching up the little black boy? Could you imagine if it was the opposite and black guys were touching up a little white girl? They'd be in jail bruh.
Ethan's Fucking crazy
I think we don't appreciate Ethan enough for doing these things for us...
When Frank starts yelling at Ethan Ethan looks so sad and its hilarious
The fupa leak at 2:18 is beautiful
PLease spread this message. WE want the pranksters to do a SNEEZE IN THE HOOD PRANK. make it happen. Make the hood great AGAIN!
LOLOLOLOL DUDE. so hot
classic chub n' tuck
1:19 its jamal crawford
"Go to the beach and frost your tips-sit in the sun till it looks like you have jaundice" waiting for it to hit #1 on itunes
"U look like a highlighter with Down syndrome" LMAOOOOO
i am  not sure if jon was acting or not. It was really genuine :)
So happy I found this channel.

Seems I have a bit of catching up to do.
Anyone know the song at 11:53? That shit is dope!
11:48
I think this is Ethan's magnum opus
2:20 
Damn Ethan fucked up. He should've keeped dancing and let his shirt raise above his fupa and up to his chest. Would've been funnier.
And all this shit just for some clicks?
man, your hair looks shitty and you look like a common mexican :D
fupa leak starts at 2:14
I love Jon's hair
Bronze means third place u ain't shit!
This is 4th time I've watched this.
Tbh, this song is actually pretty good
Fucking hell, Ethan's dedication is insane
god you have to tip even at a tanning salon.  jesus christ america
you really went all out man, holy shit!
XD this came out on my birthday
Bring back the 80's????
that 1 dude looks like a yung keemstar
This is brilliant hahahahaha
Seriously my favourite h3h3 video!!
Nice to see these Youtube Legends in the same video!
Ethan is like Prometheus, you brought fire (tracks) and the people weren't ready
This was hilarious
12:59 what is going on here? Is he having a 90s bronze brain aneurysm?
Dang! That fupa...... Goddamn that hot 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😍😍😍😝💦💦❤️❤️❤️
Lol Justin Timberlakes 90's hair!
Ethan dude i wanna learn those moves!
funniest channel on you tube.
With those frosted tips and that spray tan, he looks like some weird hobo.
Second ever h3h3 video for me I hope the rest are like this
He turned himself into a Jewmpa Loompa
the shit you do for views it's funny 😄
What's the song from 00:00 to 00:30???
hila tell Ethan that if he joins a 90's boy band again I won't call him my son in law
This guy is a legend
you kinda scare me to be honest dude
is that really ethain in the boyband though?
one of the kids in the band looks kinda like soflo antonio
I love how at 4:03 she just has to pick her nose at work in front of a camera.
For ppl who believe that h3h3 doesnt have talent and all they do is react to videos, this video is proof that they (or Ethan at the very least) are indeed very talented
out of all people,  I'd  expect Papa Franku to join.
12:52 lol I think Hila was laughing
Oh man I was feeling pretty down tonight but after a good run and this video I am laughing again!
Haha... thanks for the laughs.
I like how Jon's clothes in this video are the same in his Blizzard Rant video (just noticing :D)
Are you sure these aren't lesbians?
while i was watching this my girl was watching the miss america bullshit n backstreet boys started playing... fucked my head up
Seriously addicted to this video......
I cant watch this, I JUST CANT. SAVE ME!!!
Is that Hhla person a man? For some reason she or he gives me a transgender vibe.
Ethan is the next Randy Newman.
He looks more yellow than bronze
HOMOGENEOUS KHALIDIUS SPOTTING AT 9:19 HUNTING FOR EGG WHITES BEHIND PAPA ETHAN ON THE SUBWAY
5:24 nice chins bud.

B4-4 [Get down] "legal copy" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)...

Just found this channel subbed too funny lol
this is like penn and teller's bullshit, but on youtube.
plot twist, lyrics say, I´M GONNA MAKE HIM COME TONIGHT
He looks like a 90's c-3p0
19:18 dj khaled
8:08 - the best part of the video.

> Why don't you write a tumblr post about it you fucking PC bitch!

 <3
"WHY DON'T YOU WRITE A TUMBLR POST ABOUT IT YOU PC BITCH!"

Fucking dead.
i think it's best that Jon didn't join your band. he would only be able to sing ECH. and Franku would probably only sing CAN I HABE DE PUSI PLEASE!!
v å p о я ш å v ê    IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR STRUGGLE
my 8 year old bro say this and he did not understand  a word
Ethan saying "PC BITCH" (8:20) reminded me so much of Boogie2988
love this shit
get down syndrome
too funny
2:12 is when I died. R.I.P😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
As someone born December 19th, 1999. I am a 90s kid and and I miss the 90s
I used this song for a presentation on the war on terror.
What a commitment.
Ethan's song is actually better than the B4-4's song. Srsly, schmoyoho makes the best songs. I wish the song was longer.
That kid from the music video looks like Cal Chuchesta
The "90's" what an amazing time to be a Catholic priest.
almost as gay as 1 dick
But did you see that they were wearing couple necklaces with the girls on the beach? 
All the cool kids look like that!!
The 90s are cuming back boys!
dank
this nigga brought a picture omg
Someone please tell me if I can buy this song. Please, I need this song.
I just think you need an acting Oscar for this dramatic masterpiece. And who directed it? P. T. Anderson?
3:44 - Best 3 seconds of my life
LOL!!! This is epic hahaha i am in love with this shit
The fucking shit you went through in this one. You're hardcore.
Is this on spotify? ;)
But seriously, is there an instrumental?
10:07 gold
2:51 "Gonna make you come tonight, over to my house". Notice how one guy says the first part, and the other guy says "over to my house" and he jumps into the frame and cockblocks his bro. What a dick.
"Why don't you write a tumblr post about it, you PC bitch!"
"israeli carrot" god damned jon
this was on YTV (2:25), a channel for 12 year olds
OMG STAHHPP
JABOODYYYYYYYYYY
Ethan has the clean cut charm of a boy band front man
BRING THE 90S BACK
oh man :'DDD at some points ethan kinda looks like george michael
Lol
The song was in the early 2000s not the 90s.
omg those people in the boyband look like bleached apes. It's a little scary.
This guy is the king of satire
\//\/
I would pay to watch EthanXHila porn
I actually really enjoy songs that sound like this but I was born in the 2000s
That meeting with Filthy Frank was a genuinly well done performance piece. Bravo!
is there an instrumental version of the song?? \//\ papa bless.
He looks like donald trump
wow ethan, you have a big fucking head.
thats fucken great lmao
can i get the song on itunes??
Did I just watch a weird video for 13 minutes.!?
+respect to h3h3 for doing this
Commitment man 😂🙌🏽
i'm getting extremely jiggy with it, right now
If Ethan just shaved his beard dude... 10 girls per testicle right there!
Ethan! I need a full version of this song in my life! Like if you agree!
Damn, Ethan has a nice sexy curvy body. Nice tits, wide hips, delicious ass.
Sub earned. Fucking hysterical.
I'm gonna make you come tonight




Over to my house.
Who else feels like this video got to real when ethan and frank talked
Favorite video on youtube.
Dude's face at 10:09 says "wtf?"
im a fagoat
the guy with glasses said the n word lisen carefuly
The boyband look like three blonde soflos
he looks like fat mike from nofx!
He needs jeans with holes in the knees.
if you get down on me, I'll get down on you.
You look like an Israeli carrot.
ethan really dosent care what people think thats what i love about him
Damn. This guy deserves more subs! So funny man and he just crazy things in video that makes everything better in his channel!!!
My only thought is why
Ethan, for once listen to the Francis of the Filth
oh shit it's tommy he's back nobody messes with tommy
8:07 to 9:00 funny af
גאווה ישראלית?
Ethan and Hila are the kind of people I would love to sit down and have a BBQ with. Great going guys.
starting at 11:06 Ethan's head just looks like it's moving separately from his body.
I have never heard of b4-4 in my life
d00d
'you look like a highlighter with downs syndrome' LOL
yep, that was the funniest thing i have see for a long time, I am laughing while I type.
10:15 standard emergency tissue box check'd
Looks like Fat Mike at 6:02
Frank: "That`s Racist"

           3 seconds later...

"You ain`t shit nigga"

-_-
papa franku
I am honestly shocked by how overtly sexual these lyrics are.
This is the funniest shit I've ever seen
Dude - this is so fucking hilarious!  Great JonTron cameo!
Get Down by b4-4 came out in 2000. It is a fake 90's song!
"You know what bronze means? Bronze means third place. You ain't shit nigga!" Damn Frank is savage!
I'm gonna make you come... TO JEFF DUNHAM NEW SITCOM"
2:18 uh, Ethan, you uh, gotta little somthin hanging out the back there
did filthy frank say (you ain't shit nigga?)
k...he actually looks hotter than ever with the mohawk...
Fucking Canada.
highlighter with down syndrome. dead.
That was pretty hilarious.
That's fuckin' blackface.

Damn I love Frank.
I love how the song was made in the early 2000s
What am I watching I am on such a weird part of YouTube right now.
I miss the 90s but mainly for the cartoons and nostalgia reasons, defo not the fuckin music
I'm gonna ruin the fun and point out that Get Down was released in 2003.
get some hot babes, take em to ya moms place!  straight FIRE... fuckin grammy shit right here..
Im wanting for h3 to make a video on asmr
LMAO WTF? FILTHY FRANK ahahahahahaha
tim and Eric af
The spirit of the 90s is alive in Portland.
If Filthy Frank told me to get my shit together i'd rethink all my life decisions
Looks like faze rain
If Eric Bana and Tim Heidecker had a love child, he would be it.
Anyone else getting Tai Lopez ads again?
how can schmoyoho keep a straight face omg
Haha love it
Sooo bad, retards
I miss the tuft
Laughed way harder at 2:13 than I probably should have.
Those guys are kind of scary. They look like demons from Charmed or something.
you look like a retarded highlighter hahahhaha
ITS THE MOTHER FUCKING FUPA 2:21
THis is literally some of the funniest shit ive ever seen in my life. Good fuckin job
Ill think about it buts its probably a no. Nah thats a no.
Ethan: Hey Hila, Im gunna make you come tonight.
Hila: You are?
xD
The worst thing of all is... I kinda like the song.
Lol jontron
90s slav squat at the end there
I now have terminal cancer
Maybe one of the greatest videos ever
What's the music that comes on at 5:27?
YOU KNOW WHAT BRONZE IS? THIRD PLACE, U AIN'T SHIT NIGGA
Cringe fest af
This song came out in 2000....
don't bring the 90s back...it was a magical time, yes...but please...don't bring it back...let it rest in peace
Omg papa franku
youre always super funny.
You look like a guy I went to school with when you were in full b44 mode.. at 12:15 to 12:30
"get down" was released in may 2000 so its not realy the 90s
Are Ethan and Hila married or are they brothers or cousins or what?
"Bronze means third place, you ain't shit"...wonder how all those Olympic bronze medalists feel right about now
10:15 
...I see those tissues.... you aint slick....
90's music is the shit!
you look like that retard riff raff
I really wanna download this song :S
What's filthy franks skype
You're like if Tim and Eric were actually funny. 10/10
vapor wave is bringing back the 90's
Not trying to be rude or anything but him with the haircut and tan makes him look like an extremely tan version of Hulk Hogan. Hey, at least he now has an extremely awesome accent.
THIS IS train wreck man. do you think Ethan really made that producer feel awkward or was he in on it?
shut up you chubby fuck
"Hey everybody..
let me take you back
to a magical time
back in the nineteen nine zeros..
when you could just pickup some binoculars
and peep some hot ass cuties
fucking babes, it doesn't matter what your age
c'mon with me, lets take it.

Go to the beach and frost your tips
stay in the sun till' it looks like you have juandice hoh!
play some volleyball with some hot babes

My little brothers watching with binoculars on
it might be wrong but in the 90s its alright

I'm gonna make you jizz.....cuzzi with me tonight!
(a whole bunch of ays)
Uuuh, doesn't really sound that good...
I dont know man, you shouldn't...
Maybe i made a mistake.
Maybe the 90's werent that dope... I dont know, fuck..
Kinda wasted alot of time on the effort on this....
Making you jizz tonight....
You've taking it too far, this is fucking stupid."
Well at least Ethan looks like a total retard instead of a fucking jew.
Is nobody gonna bring up the fact that the song came out in 2003?
How have I not been watching this guy.
"You look like an Israeli carrot"
pause at 4:18
nobody dressed like dat in da 90s
"hey Hila, I'm gonna make you cum tonight"
"...."
"you are?"
"OVER TO MY HOUSE"
Hila was excited for that shit boiiiiii
Why does Ethan always look like a lost child
dislike, shitty video
Funny thing is that that song came out in 2000.
Are they telling the boy that they want to love him until the day they die?????????
Where's the ITunes link, bruh?
Now okay... Ethan, I love your content and all, but who calls a viewmaster VR goggles lol?
H3H3is kinda like if Tim and Eric had a miscarriage and then pumped it full of gagging noises and semen. Great job!

What I love about your channel is the amount of stuff you do for it that goes clearly beyond lazy content. Getting a fake tan, literally dying and shaving your hair! Real dedication and superb self depreciation humour! Amazing stuff!! Thanks for making such a big effort :)
Fuck hila, she needs you ass. and he sais he needs to find a girl lop
I like how they start touching the black bow and he flex his bones. and the fuckn pineapples get mad
Why did they have a young child be the one to pic up the glasses and look through them just to have a creepy guy sing about how he was going to love and cover him until the day he died? Whose idea was that and how did no one say "hey, that's sort of creepy, maybe we shouldn't do that."
Ethan is the Cringemaster... he controls the cringe with his blood...
12:55 "Ehehehhheyheheheeyeheeheyhehhehheyheyheyyheheyhehehyehyhe"

"why don't you write a tumblr post about it you pc bitch" is that Shakespeare?

fun fact about b4-4, after they broke up, two of their members made a band called ryandan

Damn filthy frank told him he went too far. A guy that ate a puke cake told him he went too far.
I just want to say thank you for going so far to make us laugh and enjoy your channel. Yall deserve more than you've got.
\/APE /\/ASH YALLLLLLLLLL
wtf why is this so fucking funny
OMG I own the exact same pair of shorts!!!
mp3 when?
that song came out in 2000 though
Ethan, I got some GOLD for you. Search heart2heart - Facebook Official. You won't regret it.
Technically speaking this song came out in May 2000 so this is not from the 90s, but who cares this is still a great video.
these videos are always such a journey
I wanna look like an Israeli carrot too.
my body cant express the amount of laughter i have lined up inside me
"Nice to see you, too."
this ass looks gay
You need to make a full song of this. PLEASE make it happen!
LOL

Imma go on a limb and say I'm going to go frost tip my ass hairs. brb.
but 7/11 was just a part time job
A Kaleidoscope is Virtual Reality now? Holy shit I feel old.
hahaha yeah, those were the times.
Why is it called "Frosted Nips"?
you got dem hips
Ethan: Hila I'm gonna make you cum tonight
Hila: You are?
He should have gotten Patrice to produce this track
i really want to buy ethans song on itunes
hAHAHAHA
Is it bad that I actually like this song and legitimately listen to it?
"Don't talk when you're spraying?"
I haven't laughed that hard at a YouTube video in a while, consider me subscribed.
8:34 Ethan is dying and Frank doesn't know whether to keep the joke going or to ask if he's alright
B4-4 and theres 3 of them hahahahahaha
"I have the sound that does that"

I fucking died.
Frostedtips.jpg
Jontron, Papa Franku, H3H3, and music by schmoyoho in one video??

This video is a gift
I really need that song.
ha ha he he.the 00tees lol
PLEASE react to RyanDan- apparently after B4-4 two of the members formed a band called RyanDan and their last album in 2014
you ain shit
2:12 that was an epic cough.
I love the confidence this guy has to go out in public like that lmao
5:50 what's the name of the song?
Amazing ahahah
This cancer must be stopped

except b4-4 was totally 2000 hahahahaha kinda still the late 90's but not really.......
Is it just me, or would Ethan look good with a blonde mohawk..
i have those shorts.... not sure how to feel about that..
Ethan's voice actually isn't that bad. For being not serious.
3:36 i'd eat your ass any day
Is this on ITunes?
There needs to be an h3h3 dance compilation lol
hila's art is quality
The definition of a fever dream
what's with that scar on the back Ethan? 4:20
gosh ethan is so cute when he dances
This video needs the 90s Fast Forward button. Just for the dancing scenes.
Edward Snowden helping Ethan to make a music video
if you disliked this video, I dislike you.
i absolutely lost it when he talked with his friends about it, and sprayed him XD
my favourite is still "stay in the sun until you look like you have jaundice"
The music video wasn't made in the 90s and I'm pretty sure Ethan is aware of that, but it does have the 90s feel to it plus would you really want the video to be titled "Ethan joins a early 2000s boy band"? No, early 2000s boy bands blow fuckin ass dude
Whats with the huge scar on Ethan's back?
Dayum Ethan, that chub n tuck hungry butt combo...
fucking Canada guys
Jesus Christ Ethan you're a fucking meme
Wanna see his first attempt at a professional music video.
Yo, where is the link to the full song?
I remember this band lmao 
they big fro like 2 years. You had to be from Canada to understand lol one of the worse things to come out of my country. I remember girls in grade 2 singing this song
Your fucking videos are God Tier now bro. I'm dying of laughter rn.
The best 90's song, made in 2003.
next up "Hila Joins 80's Glam Rock" do it please!!
I love how as Ethan crawls over and gets sick, Frank just says "You know what's bronze? Third place."
DONT EVER STOP BRONZING
if you gonna look closer to the vid on screen at 2:18 its showing the kid but the song is already going so he made the scene on the part where nobody sings (part with kid and bikini girls) and then he replaced it with the song, but Eathan, great moves keep it up proud of you ;)
70s were awesome. 80s were awesome. 90s were awesome.
BUT US MILLENNIALS  GOT FUCKING H3H3! Beat that, the past!!
Who knew it would be a jew who brought real hip hop back
filthyfrank looks and sounds like the shitty boyfriend from girls on hbo.
wtf is this
please release the whole music on itunes i need that shit
Its funny that this video has more views than the actual music video
Ethan you need to lose a little weight before it gets too bad. Just so you can have a bit more energy and feel better x
I just noticed this, Ethan, how'd you get that scar on your back, homie?
that's actually the year 2000, but das ok
This gave me a frosty tip :-)
Ur a legend
Would've been awesome if FFrank said "it's time to stop", would've been...golden!

The frosted tip cutie pies look like Reese from Malcolm in the middle...
They should really complete their song! It's so good! Haha please release the full song

Keep it up, proud of you!
This is like a Peter Griffin shenanigan lol.

Where Peter sees something he likes, then goes completely overboard with it.
I want the song in the end as its own video.
Made a ringtone from the greatest cough in history, here it is: https://www.dropbox.com/s/39j2e78pyqbnn71/Ethan%20Joins%20a%2090s%20Boy%20Band%201.m4r?dl=0

Enjoy guys!
It's a break-away pop hit!
at 8:37 to 8:39 he says you aint shit n** (filthy frank racist?)
I like that in the Ethan hila mythos crank plays the straight man who thinks Ethan's out there. and Jon's like the cynical dick friend. just make h3h3 a show with characters and have it just happen over time.
I have an unhealthy addiction with this
I'M SEVENTEEN AND I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT ETHAN IS GOING THROUGH!!!
8:33 You know what bronze means? ... Bronze Means THIRD PLACE!
well ellese is back in fashion so were getting there
ethan have you ever been cucked

This guy has  a criminally low number of subs. Cmon guys sub him
Only in NYC, I guess
he looks like some arib who is trying to get into the music industry
you look sooo Mexican lol
Such a great song
How was this allowed on YTV? That is a kids channel!
Oml Ethan looks like it's him in the 90s in the boy band
whrs the intrumental version?
И
6:15     Jon
8:04
So.... is the reason Frank and Jon couldn't join your boy band because they were working on their skateboard kid homage?
I'm sure someone, somewhere is triggered.
Set your spirit freeheehee! I love that part.
where can we find the link to download your song?
best cosplay ever
l also called HOT 97 l explained to them they are all niggers. on your behave.
7:08  the academy award goes to:  worse reading of lines ever.

I would have had the toughest time keeping it together if I was frank
8:25
best part
Lmao jontron
this has to be the best h3h3 video ever
i legit cried from laughing
3:24 "I am frankly sick and tired of beeing in my skin" Wasn't the foreskin enough?! :O
Why does the king of the jews make Youtube videos?
That BoyBand is so gay, i had to cut of my hands so i don't accidently jerk off!

6:17 JON!!!! GOD FUCKING DAMN IT I WISH I LIVED IN NY!
7:00 OH GOD NOOOOO!
Ethan does to much LOL
BlackfaceBlackfaceBlackfaceBlackface
Second best video on YouTube after vape nation.
get down is not from the 90s
I didn't expect to feel bad about Ethan, Jon and Frank not forming a boy band and hitting on young black boys.

Overall, the face at 10:09 conveys my feelings well.
9:30 that guy was walking to the beat
wish that song at the end was real and longer
"YOU'VE TAKEN IT TOO FAR THIS IS FUCKING STUPID"
XD jontron
jizzcuzzi XD
I came
+2:12  Best shit
This is beautiful, it's a parody documentary! 😍
This song was released in 2000.
Ethan you are a Bronze God of comedy and satire! Loved this one! Thank you. :)
"You look like a highlighter with downsydrome" 😂😂
RyanDan
I can't believe he actually does this stuff in front of people. I would die of shame.
"I have that sound too, that's my favorite sound."
qq
has the human race gone to far...... or not far enough....
I fucking love that wordless gaze by schmoyoho at 10:05.

6:58
Franks face made me lmao

He goes way to far sometimes
the song was made in 2000 so..
The best part of the whole thing is that the song was released in '03. :D
We need a Hila cam when Ethan does stuff like this.
Liked and subbed
Ethan buff af more than 10 buff models on steroids in the fucking moonlight man you is good.
The jizzcuzi part killed me
Kinda like Joaquin Phoenix.
\//\
2:22 Don't hide that fupa Ethan <3
He looks like a gay, white Mr. T
When he try to tape his hair back on I was dead.
Their faces make me uneasy
Ethan should join Bloodhound Gang
This guy gives no fucks
columbine only 90s kids will remember that
Holy shit Ethan... you're a real fucking legend...
absolute madman
i love how he has no self respect to the point where he can do that XD (not a hate comment i relise it sounds like one lol)
"I'm just dancing to the music, this isn't about you right now" LMAO
i fucing love thi\s vidio
Now it's all about ETHAN BRADBERRY
I love this video. This was the first Ethan and Hila video I ever saw. Good times :)
Its. Fucking. Bronzer.
13:16 , is that you DJ Khaled??

that band was from the early 2000 actually
I want you to cum... Over to my house XD
11:27
I almost forgot to watch this today.
Ethan & schmoyoho, please, make this song longer! Great collaboration!
I just came here to listen to that beat before I head out for the night. 19-9-zeros! 11:55
Bruh, how did you get that scar on your back?
I want Filthy Franks hat/helmet, lol.
damn I was waiting for Frank to say "it's time to stop"
2:20, I can't stop laughing
I wished I lived in the 90s. The song is legit good I wish I could DL is. I wish I had the VRR binoculars
I wish I could thumbs up this twice, this is my favourite upload by far, and I've watched them all
dude that fucking dance at 2:20 makes me fkn lose it every time
I love that song :-(
Definitely my favorite video from Ethan and Hila.
2,819 people didn't feel the positive vibes
Listen to how he says "such a dope line"
All of this over a 90 music video XD
Did anyone notice at 4:01 the tanning girl pickin a booger?
the cringe is strong with this one..........
Just to give you some information that b4-4 isnt a 90s boyband but an early 2000s boyband because this song is released 2003.
haha b4-4 is from early 2000's
Ted Cruz was in a boy band?
where you find all this terrible clothes ?
thats not vr you stupid fuck its a viewmaster
that kid grew up to be patrice wilson ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Ironically, the song was released in May of 2000.
Morpheus a.k.a "laurence fishburne" spotted: 9:30
Honestly Ethan, your high singing voice sounds like older David Bowie.
i dont know why but i was like nope when he pulled out the pictures of those guys
The song sounds eerily like Blink-182 song... Lol
best one so far lmao
Aye this is the song northernlion talked about lol
filthy frank
aaayyy it's Jon!
"go to the beach and frost your tips! stay in the sun till it looks like you have jaundice"
I fuckin lost it at 2:17
Bronze is third place, you aint shit
Bronze on deez nuts
Sorry. Bennet The Sage kinda ruined this music video for me :/
When you said Ethan, I didn't know whether you were talking about you or Ethan Bradberry. One of the guys on the thumbnail looks like him
"Bronze means third place you ain't shit nigga" xD
3:05 "Hila I'm gonna make you come tonight..."

...

"You are?"

LMAO
Yo what's the story behind that back scar BRAHH?
you look like the sri lankan bowler lasith malinga
later that day ethan was diagnosed with cancer from all the bronzer he inhaled
2:07 i agree they are cutie pies
Who wouldn't want to fuck that kid, come on
that's wacist -that one Asian cunt
You look like Cristiano Ronaldo
"go write a tumblr post"
You got an issue with people on the internet, fegeet?
Lol the music actually works in the beginning
You know you fucked up real bad when Filthy Frank tells you to get your shit together
Disliked - Frank said nigger
that's comitment bro
I think it would be much more hilarious if Frank joined the band
Man I love how dedicated you are to making these videos crazy
Can we have a download link for the song at 12:00? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I thought we were finally getting a good old reaction video, and then I got hit hard with the spraytan and hair cut lmao
Ethan's song is so much better than B4-4's I can't be the only one to think this right?
holy shit, your girlfriend is anorexic
02:19 chub'n'slip!
not a bad boy, kiss kiss muah muah
There was a band back in 2000 called Jump5.

Hint hint.
I almost forgot to watch it today
All the "hey"s at the end of the song was great
Tina fey is a cunt
2:12 best punch line ever
im screAMING
So he reacted to the video for like a minute.
The funny thing is these guys are actually CRAZY talented singers.  I feel like B4-4 was kind of a joke to try to get popular so they could make music they actually liked
Now this is content!
Best look for Ethan
https://youtu.be/MqgtVpD328o?t=9m14s
Plz start making fun of Jacob satorious

Wow, Jontron, great moves, keep it up XDDD

Even Papafranku told him to stop.. XD

also that last sound sounds like a seal or something XDDD
Ethan is wearing more of a 80s outfit
8:37 You ain't shit, nigga.
1:51 no doubt in my mind the little boy at the beginning is Patrice Wilson. I can recognize that smile from aaaanywhere dude
This is your finest work
ay,AY,@y,aey,aY3 a a a a a a
AT THE END THE SONG MADE ME DIE
Is there a full version of the song? I love it :)

"*Speach about ruined look*"


Subscribed

For a minute i felt like I was watching h3h3 the movie anyone else agree?
Is it just me or does this sound like the Police? Any Police song...

You know you've made some bad life choices when filthy frank is telling you to get your shit together.

Technically a noughties song, but ok.
Best episode ever.
I will take you places that you only think about when you're asleep at night.







Over to my house!
someone didn't chub and tuck before they danced
GANGURO GUYS
I looked them up and the funny thing is they made this song in 2003. That means they were literally re living the 90's which makes them even bigger memes.
he sounds like cee lo green's weird aborted sibling
Am I the only one who thinks that they each look like SoFlo?
The level of dedication this took just blows me away
My favorite video ever
Ethan has become a rockstar meme.
Ethan you will be hearing from my lawyer cuz you clearly stole my dance moves.
This is the greatest and funniest video I've ever seen! I had to pause half way I was laughing too hard! Good job Ethan!!!!

It makes me uncomfortable but I have a crush on FF. Ethan is sexy too.
"I'm gonna make you come tonight over to my house" Lost it.
2:18 Please open a dance studio
I was having a terrible day and THIS FUCKING VIDEO RIGHT HERE MADE IT BETTER THANK YOU SO MUCH ETHAN AND HILA AAAAAAAAAAAA:'))
Fupa!
this is so good it's ridiculous
Dude you have a sweet ass.
Black face is so back, baby!
The song is quite catchy you know......
Ethan got the clean cut charm of a boy band front man
Woow Its going to be great movie Im going to see it
You know you've fucked up if Filthy Frank of all people says you looks stupid
This video has made me so happy, man. Literally every day since this video has come out I've watched and it makes me laugh and laugh. Ethan, great moves. Keep it up.
its one of the Worst/Best ways to show how ridiculous those ideas were back then

made me laugh so hard
i miss the the rwandan genocide ;'(
did ethan gain some weight?
should've got the living tombstone instead
Make this an actual single please I'd buy it
Best music to rip the fattest vapes to
There is an 11 minute ad that is unskippable in the middle of video what the fuckkk
He looks like a Fucking junkie who is needing his stuff at 12:10
we WANT A FULL SONG
I've never heard of a jizzcuzzi b4-4
Frosted nip with cool whip and ships. With fips and tips and quips and monkey-pips
2000s > 90s. prove me wrong
"I'll make you come tonight,








...over to my ass"
That skype name tho... 7:05
You captured my life with this YouTube video.
"You ain't shit, nigga"
Please check out my levels on Mario Maker: 6E9E-0000-0208-A011, and my brothers levels C8E1-0000-0229-D282. We both work very hard on our level but we don't get many plays sadly. Please we deserve more plays and stars on our levels.
love those frosted tipped kewdiepies
13:20
one of my new filthyfrank one liners
this channel is shit..funny 1 year ago but now...total shit.
H3H3, you guys need to make a full length jizzcuzzi song! This is so catchy and I want to here more of it!
Do you and Hila do crack?
That guy got a very special lap dance
"Why dont you write a tumblr post about it you fuckin PC BITCH!" i give that the gold medal
Ethan = black face

Frank = 9/11
I liked ethans song tbh lol
it actually a 2003 song
im scared







again
They are called B4-4 because 3 is 'Before 4', and there is 3 of them in the the band. So yeah. Jizz....cuzzi
Can't wait for this h3h3 mixtape to drop
Doesn't the kid put the binocular thing on upside down?
Woulda been a cool hairstyle if u didnt fuck up the top lol
Blackface=Jinx=Pokemon=😮=h3h3
Gotta love the coughing.
Just jizzcuzzi'd in my pants
This isn't a 90's band, it's 2000's.
The "VR head set" is actually a view master. Which makes it even creepier because that means the band are ghosts living in it since there aren't screens or internet connection lol
One sexy muvaafuckeer!
The only fucking thing I got from the music videos were that those three guys were pedophiles... They're singing to the young black child, singing, "I'm gonna make him come tonight, over to my house!" Fucking pedophilia!
who else was cringing at the tanning part?
I... I actually think Ethan's singing voice is addicting....
Fucking Youtube is encountering a meme overload! An anomaly is doing this shit. And the anomaly is fucking h3h3. Too much memes in a timespan. We are truly in the Golden Age of Youtube.
FYI the song at 5:30 is 'Level Plane - Riot', not 'Lover's Stripes'
Does the tanning lady pick her nose at 4:00? D:
I love how much y'all own this mistake. Always n forever a fan, peace V N
this is cancer
When filthyfrank roasted him i fucking lost it.
Lmao "I'm gonna make you jizzcuzzi tonight"
lmao I can't believe hila is ok with this
who are the 2k wankers that disliked this video?
He looks like a gay banana
Hey can I get this song on iTunes?
When ur parents walk in the room while watching this video then yo switch to porn because its easier to explain
Do one of cks1911
Plot Twist: "Get Down" was released in 2000
Karolina said that beards are bad but i said they are good
:)
I don't know why, but the way he went down the stairs fuckin' killed me 😂
your videos would look psychopathic out of context
11:20 the guy sitting down loves ethan dancing
i don't get those dislikes.  ethan is a method actor. daniel day lewis wouldn't tan himself over a 90s boy band role.
He's gone too far with this one, man
bro came thru with some shitty ass kicks tho cmon dog
boy pussy
Is that a surgical scar, at Ethan's left shoulderplate area?
Goddamn, the boy band song sounds a lot like Slime Girls. That's always a good thing.
a tragedy
Ethan, please make mockumentaries
WHOLY SHIT THIS WAS AMAZING
IM DONE
JOOOONNN TROOOONNN
Ethan's voice sounds like auto tune sometimes even though it's his normal voice. What a fucking god among men.
Ethan's FUPA > DJ Khaled's FUPA
I need help . let me preface , I don't want pity . I was put on stimulants at a young age , and now I'm a stimulant addict as an adult . I love to make music and rap .I made a song exposing how people in my position feel . let's save lives and get it trending ..
Ethan are you high?
Ethan are you high?
Closest thing to a new jontron video il take it
Is Hila his wife or sister. Cus they look like brother and sister.
Anyone know the notes for the piano at the end?? Can I have pls....
Great song.
Ethan actually looks better w the frosty tips
This episode was godly.
Freaking hilarious!
And i thought Frank is retarded
Just here for my daily dose of this video
Start at 11:48 for the song, and play it at half speed. You are very welcome.
'You've takin' this way too far' Coming from FilthyFrank.... I mean bro, you got a problem.
It's funny how you say this is the 90s and shit but wasn't this song released in 2003?
2:21
you the biggest fag
NEVER get rid that that Michelle Obama clip
All three of those guys look like soflo in some way
Bronze means 3rd place you ain't shit
why does reddit literally suck h3h3's and jontrons cocks like literally every single day. Is there any come left?
@ 5:00 is fucking hilarious
Tim and Eric would be proud of that song
Who else has watched this more than 3 times?
You look like a fucking child molester.
\//\
Wait, wait. 
B44 were from the early 2000s, not the 90s.
The song 'Get Down' (featured in this video) was released in 2003.
Lmao,
Awesome channel
I fucking love this
I actually really want those shorts now
"you ain't shit nigga"
You looks like Kenny Hotz
Make a video about "dillon the hacker"
oh dayum
So many anime crossovers
Hila wanted to find someone who wasn't shy, 
A guy not afraid to pump it
That's when she overheard a guy named Ethan,
 just blowin' his own trumpet
9:17
dj khaled passing behind ethan
Now I know why your videos are taking so long to appear on your channel. 
They're awesome
For the guys like me that come visit here to listen to the song, here ya go: 11:49
#SprayNation

#AnythingForYoutubeMoney
HOW SURPRISING! A canadian jewish boy band singing a subliminally super sexual song for goys.. oops i mean kids..
Holy shit. Top tier video guys, keep it up
top meme
Jizz.       Cuzzie with me tonight 😂😂😂

papa franku :v
am i the only one that low-key loves ethans singing?
move to Portland
Ethan: Hila I'm going to make you come tonight. 

Hila: You are????
Holy shit Ethan has some nice buns
That Skype call was fake! Your computer didn't freeze and the video wasn't choppy 240p bullshit and frank didn't sound like a toaster.
Can i have an intrumental for this please?
I feel like Ethan could actually rock a low mohawk pretty well.
That barber just casually picks her when Ethan isn't looking
When can I get the song on iTunes though Ethan??
To people complaining that the songs not really from the 90's. It's only from 2001! THAT STILL HAS THE 90'S FEEL! It's not like he called something from 2007 like Jonas Brothers the 90's! (Which, trust me, some people actually do)
DJ Khaled...He's smart, He's loyal, He's behind you!!! 9:17
I fucking lost it at "jizzcuzzi".......
I want those shorts! And I would wear them with all sincerity1
I have the sound that does that.
WHats with the dickhead in the sunglasses. Almost ruins the who video.
8:26 you sounded just loke Boogie there
Ethan went full Heidecker
The funny thing is B4 - 4's first album was in 2000.
You and Politikz should do a song together.
Ethan who?

A E S T H E T I C
Jizzcuzzi (verb) A jizzcuzzi is when a you are having intercourse and when pulling out, you blow your load and all the warm jizz fills up her bellybutton, creating a jacuzzi of jizz.
Instant classic Ethan. Appreciate ya.

The boyband and song is from 2000...

90s...?
08:37 Flithfrank says nigga?
Ive watched this video like 15 times this week. Its so funny. Hila, you're a lucky lady :)
I was kinda going between half-chuckling and cringing uncontrollably, and then Jon said "You look like an Israeli carrot." God bless.
They remind me of galo sengen
9:44-11:35 lmfao 10:58 was the moment I lost my shit.
I'M ETHAN BRONZEBERRY
-9000 points off your 90's kid card for calling a Viewmaster  "VR Goggles".
Did FlithyFrank just call Ethan a nigga..?
"You've taken it too far this is fuckin stupid"- coming from the guy who fuckin eats hair and vomit cake all while doing the gayest shit possible with his fukboi fukbuddy youtube friends. he has absolutely no right to place limits on people lol
you embraced the worest part of the 90s
I actually really like h3he but you do know this song was made in 2003
You were funnier before when you let shit naturally flow. Now you are just overthinking shit man. Gotta get back into the soflow of things bro.
11:50 ur welcome
B4-4 looks like they reproduce asexually
"That's racist. That's blackface"

Lmfaooo
These guys were bronze 5 before it was cool to be bronze. 
Sincerely your neighborhood b44 fan. 
Bfor it was cool.  After it was hot.
lose some weight
You CANT STOP ME FROM BRONZING
Ethan has a magical voice.
We need to stop instigating him to do this.
I don't think about hair when he says frosted tips.
Ethan your head looks freakishly large at 11:25 pls see a doctor.
Ethan looks like a 40 year old lesbian with frosted tips
Make a post on tumbler you pc bitch!!
I'm going to start putting "over to my house" at the end of things so people know it's all totally innocent.
"Deport all Mexicans... over to my house."
"I'm gonna give that pre-teen girl a ride... over to my house."
"Jude , erhalten auf den Zug... zu mir nach Hause."
Frank: "Bronze means 3rd place. U ain't shit nigga" that one liner nearly killed me XD.
RELEASE THE FULL SONG
these moves killed me 2:19 xDDDDDDD
2:31 look at the left guy on the screen's face
The dedication is unreal.
You have lost your fucking mind.
goddamn ethan dat ass
Ethan looking like Guy Fieri's mentally challenged brother.
In the future I see a JonTron video featuring Ethan and Frank and it will be the best video ever to exist.
It's like watching a B-52 bomber loaded with agent orange tailspin slowly into a heavily populated city. You know the outcome, but you want to see the after effects.
why does Ethan walk like Sid the Science Kid
sooo I'm new to h3h3 is hila his sister?
Yo this is a great anime, thanks Ethan.
To be honest the song isn't that bad
GOD DAM ethan has so real ass dedication to the jokes
Is this guy homo? His walk was bad...
The only god you guys should worship is Ethan.
Holy shit I lost it when JonTron called him an israeli carrot.
Why did Ethan just call himself 1/3rd? Fits perfectly.
gonna make you cum tonight
the 2:18 fupa leak will seriously never get old
The truly hilarious thing is that b4-4 came out in 2000
Ethan, Franku, and JonTron. The legends
Ethan is going to get lung cancer from all the vaping and bronzer
11:22 this isn't about you dude, I'm just dancing
Little fuk sounded nice in the song too.
I love how the demo picture of b4 4 he gave to the tanning lady was one where all their mouths are in an O shape
The more you watch it the funnier it gets.
God Ethan, get your facts straight. B4-4 were formed in 1999 and the song that is featured in this video "Get Down" was released in the year 2003 therefore its not a 90's song and the are not really a 90's band.
They look like 3 So Flo Antonios
You took this to far, but i LIKE IT
I love Michael Gregory's (Schmoyoho) face after Ethan asks if he believes in him.
YTV, fuck me
looks like a banana haha
RIP, papa bless
Video was fine until JohnCums
If only there was a full version of the song he is singing.
Young Rich Piana all over the place in this clip.
Just watching him spray all of that that bronzer, made me sick to my stomach.
Ethan's version was 10x better than b4-4's
#BringBackThe90'sH3H3Style
Deeper story than any fuckin A movie x D
They are darker than the black kid
The dude that says "over to my house" is just cock blocking. He throws a football at the ground, then gets down on you and leaves the twins hangin'.
The dude that days over to my house is just cock blocking. That's why he throws a football down after. Then he gets down on you.
6:59, Filthy Frank and I have the same Mexican blanket.
Damn guy got a spray tan and a shitty haircut for this vid.
He's gonna fucking get skin cancer
Ok, you win, liked, i didn't liked Vapenation because people overhyped it too much but this is really good, it was worth it.
This song needs some mayonnaise.
The URL is the longest shit, wtf happend
real talk. This nigga got a LP somewhere?
I love how Frank is always on the verge of laughing at the ridiculousness of all the shit going on around him
12:15 You look like a prostitute.
neckbeard BOI

im high af
Virtual reality? scoff
That was a confirmed fupa leak
Bronze Ethan scares me.
Israeli Carrot. I fucking lost it...
Can anyone tell me the name of the background music on the song ??
"You look like a highlighter with down syndrome"

Both papas joining forces, life is good.

This one was too cringy for even me to get through... good fucking job man lol

youre getting soft ethan, bad moves, step it up.
Hey everybody, let me take you back to a magical time, back in the nineteen nine zero's, when you could just pick up some binoculars and peep some hot ass cuties, f*kin' babes, it doesn't matter what your age, come on with me, let's take it, go to the beach and frost your tips, stay in the sun 'til it looks like you have jaundice *woo, play some volleyball with some hot babes, take it to your mom's place, let's give them AIDS, spray them AIDS yeaahhh woo, my little brother's watching with binoculars on, it might be wrong, but in the nineties it's so right, 'cause I'm wearing my puka shell necklace tonight, puka shell necklace tonight, I'm gonna make you jizz... -cuzzi with me tonight, erhm, doesn't really sound that good, I don't know man, maybe I made a mistake doing this, maybe the nineties weren't that dope, I dunno, I've been wasting a lot of time, money and effort on this making you jizz tonight
Make a full version of the song!
i
9:21 - 9:33 We can see Morpheus from the matrix casually strolling, behind Ethan, in the subway. That same subway that Neo rids the world of one more agent...
0:19

Wow this is a great music video, I am going to see it.
"Bronze means third place, get your shit together" I died
that tan was on point
Is it me or does B4-4 have a soflo vibe to them? With their massive noses and tan hairstyle?
All hail memekings Jontron, FilthyFrank, and Ethan!
Ethan, Im offended by your cultural appropriation of Italian-Americans!




Lol, JK.
WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ETHAN!
this shit was scary.
Can he die from spraying that shit in his face lmao
So where did Ethan get the clip of Michelle Obama?
Nice video, Ethan! I bet that if you suck a dick and swallow the cum in a video you will get even more subscribers! Keep it up!
"Play some volleyball with some hot babes,
take 'em to your mom's place and give them AIDS"

my favorite part
PF calls Ethan a racist proceeds to call him a nigger.

How does he use clips in his videos without copyright infringement.
Frank's trying so hard not to laugh
Wow, I didn't know Ethan was a professional singer!
"I'm gonna make you jizz.....cuzzi with me tonight" lmao nailed it
He looks like something you'd see on the streets of Detroit asking for drugs,money, or sex you could make a documentary on how tan he got and how frosted his tips are
Franku. Just, Franku
dont take it any further ethan, this is what started maxmofoe and lead him to getting howtobasic rubbing fucking charcoal in his eyes.
You look like an Israeli carrot
ONLY 90'S KIDS WILL REMEMBER THIS
i only keep coming here for the cringe cough/gag
Does anyone else think Ethan's head looks 2 sizes too big during his lil dance at 11:25 to 11:33?   Lmao=)
when Filthy Frank tells you to get your shit together, you know you're in a bad spot...
"I'm gonna make u jizz.... Cuzzi with me tonight" dope line.
Ethan please never change this is the best thing on Youtube, great moves, keep it up.
"I miss the 90's! Nothing is as awesome anymore like when I was in the 90's! 90's music was the best! Why couldn't time just stop when I was in the 90's!?" - Some kid born in 1999
Did that gay cunt just say the n word at 8:39
We need to bring back the bronzed look!
This video gave me frosted tips. Thanks broskidoodles.

This Video gave me Aids
Why does Ethan have a huge fucking scar on his back?
Damn, Ethan got the booty tho ;)
the song actually good
"You look like an Israeli carrot". Fuck I love Jon.
Ethan's head looks gigantic in this video.
he ended up looking a lot more like the black kid instead of the cute hot ass babes
Ethan genuinely gives not a single shit. Please never change, you glorious bastard.
12:46
next vid should be about DJ khaleds you mine
Ethan vs Frank... I came. To  your house.
Hey, asshole! I need to go to bed! Stop making me stay up to watch your videos like I'm some kind of drug addled prostitute... but with videos... or something!

Anyway, just wanted to say I appreciate ya. Keep it up!
Everyone do yourself a favour and just repeat watch from 11:30 till the end it's the best part. #newringtone
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=669350412
Guys I just can't stop looking at Ethan in this form. He's ascended.
I think 'Frank' was actually serious about Ethan.
he sayd nigga😮
I heard b44 are making a comeback, with Ethan as their lead singer.
Happy 4/20 y'all
Cringes!!
When Filthy Frank gets called "PC" you know the world is fucked up.
I like how the Jon bit was filmed on the same day as his Blizzard video.
Did anyone else hear Frank say "Nigger" omg how offensive innit
b4-4 all look like SoFlo Antonio to me
Aaaaaaand the original has been taken down.
Thats a cool scar ethan has..
i love how the tanning woman just picks her nose at 4:00
It's pretty terrifying when he looks into the mirror at the end and breathes heavily.
This is a strange porno
Wonder why that VR glasses the black kid found were in the garbage...hmmmm......
Atleast the music video's director was sincere.
Ur a legend
Damn dude, you really commit to your videos. I'd give you a pat on the back if I could.
Isn't this song from 2003?
Was hoping Mr Bradberry would make a comeback, instead we got the actual Ethan. 

I don't know which is better.
i wrote my girlfriend this a while back and just decided to try it out 50 works best



Alexis, I'm sorry for what I did. I didn't know that it was wrong. I really love you and I would never do anything to hurt you as long as I live. I only wanted the best for you, but instead I messed it all up. I really hope you will forgive me because I don't think that I will ever be able to find another girl like you. You are beautiful and loving, you mean the world to me. I just want you to know that I would never hurt you on purpose. You mean everything to me and I love you with all my heart. I want you to be in my life forever, right by my side. I don’t know what I would do if I could never tell you that I love you again. I can't even believe that you said yes to me or that you like me for who I am because I'm not very much. No one has ever loved me like you do, and I'll never love anyone like I love you. You are sweet, loving, fun to be around, and a great friend. I'm very happy that I got to know you so well, and believe me, none of this is your fault. It's all mine. You are my best friend, and hopefully still my girlfriend because you are the greatest girl I know. I'm so thankful to have you in my life and my memories. If you don't want to be with me anymore then I understand, you can go back with your Ex or find someone else, but I doughty that the will ever love you as much as I do. But I don't make your choices, you do, so if you choose to leave me then I'm fine with that. But promise me you'll still talk to me every now and again. I love talking to you, something about it puts a smile on my face, and I don't know if it's your voice or your looks. But all I know is that you have a special place in my heart and are welcome to come back any time you like. If you don’t come back at all then that’s ok, I'll just go back to being my lonely, depressed, self, cause being with you makes me incredibly happy, and without you I don't know if I would even be alive right now because the day I asked you out, if you hadn't have said yes I had been planning to end it later that night, So you saved my life, In more ways than one, cause that day If I had killed myself or not I thought that I would be alone forever, cause you are the first girlfriend that I have ever had. And I was so happy when you said yes cause that showed me that I had been all wrong, and that there really was a beautiful girl out there that liked my for who I am and didn't want me to pretend to be something that I'm not, and when you told me that, at first I didn’t believe you because I’m not very much to begin with. You’ve told me things that no one else ever has. You’ve shared your secrets with me [don’t worry, I’ll keep them safe], I want you to know that no matter what happens to us, I’ll always love you more than anything. Even if we’re side by side or a thousand miles apart, I’ll love you till the very end. You’re the best thing that has ever happened to me and I’ll never forget you even after I die, your memories will stay alive forever. My amount of love for you is more than the amount of stars in the night sky. My love for you is like the flame of a candle, calm on the outside, but intense on the inside, my love for you is immortal. My love for you shall never die, and if it does then so will I. But since nothing brought us together, nothing will bring us apart. I love you. And it’s not because you make me happy, not because you make me feel special, nor because you’re the sweetest person ever, but because I just love you. And I don’t need any reason for that. I’ve been smiling all day thinking of you. My life is wonderful as long as you’re in it. I would write you an essay on how much I love you, but there just isn’t enough paper in this world so I’m typing it instead. If I had to choose between breathing and you, I’d use my last breath to say I love you. To the world you are but one person, but to this one person, you are the world. I’ll put a drop of water in the ocean and when you find it, I’ll leave you. A day without you is like an eternity in hell. You have my heart, please keep it safe, because there’s a little part of it that is just for you. Through our darkest, through our highest, we will walk together, we’ll stand tall forever. You might not know this but I’d go out of my way just make sure you’re ok. A while back you were just a stranger. But now you mean everything to me. I love you more than ever, more than time, more that love, I love you more than money and more than the stars above. I love you more than all these things, with a love that doesn’t bend. And if there is eternity, I’ll love you there again. I love you because you actually put effort into me. I love you because nobody has ever given me the love that you have given me and you are the only one that I could ever love in this way. I love you because you always make me feel that I am worth something. I love you because you have a loving nature and you take care of me. I love you because you have a huge and honest heart. I love you and every little detail about you. I love you because you are simply you. I love you because you are beautiful. I love you because you except me for who I am. I love you because you actually love me back. I love you because you said yes to me. I love you so deeply. I love you so much. I love the sound of your voice. And the way that we touch. I love your warm smile. And your kind thoughtful way. The joy that you bring, to my life every day. I love you today, as I have from the start. And I’ll love you forever, with all of my heart. You are the light when there is no sun. You are the rainbow after the rain is done. You are the star that twinkles in the night. You are the moon that glows so bright. You are the wind that whistles my name. You are the love when the world is insane. You are the flowers the bee never misses. You the beach that the warm sun kisses. And if angels exist to protect us, then I have met mine, because you are the protector of my heart, my soul, my life and I give it all to you freely, unquestionably and never ending. You are my heart, my soul, my treasure, my today, my tomorrow, my forever, you are my protector, my love, my friend, and even if you never love me again, I’ll love you till the very end.
This video made me proud to be a subscriber! Keep up the good work ethan! If you have a dream go for, dont let raspy voiced turd nurgers tell you otherwise!

I CAME to my room to watch this and then I CAME
Hmm.. I think JonTron would actually be a good looking guy if he works out...Ehh... Obviosly no homo.

Please help out Charlie from Charisma on Command Ethan and Hila! He is going through some YouTube copyright bullshit and he needs some support; his channel isn't as big so he needs as much help as he can get!
What if B4-4 copyright strikes this video....?




AD VICTORIAM BROTHERS
This video was awesome!!! Video commentary on a really creepy music video, plus satirizing 90s culture, plus man on the street goofs and gaffs, plus Ethan going through a daring Oscar-worthy body transformation, plus a musical number, AND cameos from JonTron, Filthy Frank, and Schmoyoho. Damn Ethan, you've outdone yourself. Don't stop making quality content, dawg.
Creepy
first camera ever, that records bass line
God these comments are cancer
@8:38 did the guy say "you ain't shit nigga" lol

Ethan, I believe that you can make great and beautiful music dude, but please don't harm your bootiful face with spray tan.. 👌
Since when does Frank care about things being racist?

8:38
And then he says "Nigger," lel.

Is there a way I can download or purchase the frosted tips song?
#fuckleafy

amazing. like a time portal time machine time Errol straight to my childhood
Holy shit, can you guys imagine just how great it would've been if Jontron and Filthy Frank said yes and they actually made a boy band? Daaamnn...
I love the intro to this song 11:49 to 12:17 those frosted tips
this song from 2000 tho
you looked like a real alpha male man, no one can best you at that
This video and the Vape Nation video are life
I swear, this is their best video. it's brilliant, the fucking song killed me
The kid in the video looks like a younger version of Patrice Wilson
you're a fucking lunatic Ethan but that's why I love you <3
Holy shit. It's endless. I fucking love you guys, Ethan and Hila. I laugh like a schoolgirl at so much of your stuff. Kudos and keep it up! (It's an erection joke!)
The guy behind Ethan at 9:26 walks perfectly to the beat anyone else notice?
at 9:17 does DJ Khaled walk behind Ethan?
12:06 to 12:18

on repeat
Ethan was diagnosed with skin cancer the day after.
Go vegan to get your body back!
OOMPA LOOMPA

Off the top, Jontron's a cutie. I'd make him come. To my house tonight.
hey h3 you got a nice shirt
I swear to god, a video where Ethan and his friends give him an intervention would be such a funny video.
It'd be known as the time where Ethan ironically had a mid-life crisis.
I just looked that band up and they didn't even release a song in the 90s.. it's a 2000s band. Fail.
Hey!!! Nice shirt

Hey h3h3, Nice shirt man!

That ending was both powerful and artistic. That face at the end was the embodiment of regrets...

And ur behind my smartphone glass soooooooo DIRECTION MOMA!
Nice shirt
Ethan you forgot ; the hair whip, the bracelets - you will never become a hanson without these. These are the foundation for a 90s boy band.
Ethan please make a full version of the song at the end, that would complete my life
When filthyfrank tells you to get your shit together you know you f****d up 😂😂
It all makes sense now.

Actually no it doesn't, even while high as fuck this shit is still creepy man.

6:39 Why that dirty fucking Iranian
hey just wanted to say. nice shirt Ethan.
Ethan is garbage now!
you just look like a homeless man from Florida

the jondis line made me piss myself
If I'm gonna go it alone? I better do it right. With the only boys I ever loved, B4-4. And if they're B4-4 and there's only one of me? I guess that makes me, a quarter to 1, after 5. Which is before 4, I'm 5. I'm B5, quarter to 1. Quarter to 1 o'clock. B4-4 B5. Before there was 4, before there was 4, there was B3. But I'm after 4 so I'm actually B5. And I'm just 1 dude, so I'm quarter to 1. Quarter to 1, B5-5.
Hey Ethan, nice shirt man!!!
i love when you guys Mack a documentary videos like this
dude I totally remember watching this video by b4 -4 back in the day on Much Music they had one more hit called Everyday it was more of a ballad but after that I never heard anything from them again lol ... we need a B4 - 4 reunion special make it happen Ethan ! lol .. also Wetmovie1 is my homey !

10 girls sucking each other's dicks...
My professor found these guys (I'm in a Music Industry Arts program).... they were singing in the lobby of Sony apparently they wanted to sing to anybody at the label that would listen. He was the A&R guy but he told them he was the janitor haha. He ended up bringing them upstairs to sign them and stuff and basically he told the class a lot of the same points Ethan is pointing out, dark times my friend hahahah
franku you fuck. this was a perfect chance to show us your skill and you did not take it. 
I now am sad
Dear god
Fuck my nigga, you should have just hit me and my shit up. I'll join your fucking boyband every day of the week.
H3H3 is ONE of my inspirations to come to YouTube.  I am YouTubes savior!? https://twitter.com/ReinventYouTube A new channel awaits this summer, Original content confirmed. 11 followers in day 1.
Going out lookin like a bronze peanut & drinking wine in public? Now that's a social experiment! (Gone wrong) (Gone meme)

This song has so much innuendo in it and I don't know how to feel about it.
Jon Tron's "Israeli Carrot" line had me crying
wtf im I watching
LOL UR SINGING OMG
Is there a full version of the song?
Do they tell the place its taking the piss or is it all raw?
Damn I thought I was pretty into boy bands at that time, but DAFUQ. Apparently I know nothing.
It kind of pisses me off, each decade of the 20th century had it's own style. . .  what is going on with the 21st century? Our fashion trends basically are just borrowing from other previous trends.
I just came so hard at the sight of the fupa at 2:20
4:28 best xD
Why don't you wrote a Tumblr post about it ya PC bitch. Best line gotta be
Suck my dick Ethan
This sort of Reminds me of an intensified version of what Blink 182 was doing.
1:17 that boys shirt is the most 90's thing in this video. Typical stripe through it, So 90's it's deadly.
why dose the song that he makes sound like something straight out of Tim & Eric awesome show
Hey Ethan, great moves, but one quick question: How are you going to explain this to your kids?
Wow Ethan, great moves, keep it up, proud of you.
That spray tan comes off right
Ethan's chub and tuck is actually so inspirational..
Anyone feel a Tim and Eric vibe from this?
The guy in yellow actually looks like SoFlo.
Someone seriously needs to make a gif of 2:19 - 2:24 lmao
"You get down on me and I'll get down on you" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
9:18 SPOTTED A WILD DJ KHALED
So lit
OH GOD I wanna suck me some boy band cock so bad! BUST!!!!! and squirt squirt all in my mouth. yummy yum yummy.
When Ethan was in the goggles! XD
When Ethan was in the goggles! XD
Ohhhhh, so this is what northernlion was quoting in that one Isaac episode.
Jimmie Outlaw would have joined up!  It's Weiner Time!
Franku's face when Ethan's dancing to the music gets me every time.
That dude with the black/red hair looks like MattyBRaps.
ethan, your last name means small in german
Ethan, your a fucking looser.
Ethan looks like a golden gay time.
Hot.
Ethan is thick af
Nobody noticing how creepy it is, that three bronzed paedophiles saying to the black kid they're going to get down on him?!!
I WAS BORN IN THE WRONG GENERATION 90'S MUSIC IS THE BEST!
Until it looks like you have jaundice! Lol!!!
I love the little run he does at 0:30 it's fucking hilarious

Sometimes I'm proud to be a 90s kid... then... there's other times.
inb4 copyright strike
Thank you for helping cr1tikal <3

Anyone else born in 1998?
RIGHT HERE
you remind me of big smoke
Ethan you look great (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The 80's >>>>>> 90's
only 90s kids will remember this...
When FilthyFrank tells to get your sh*t together, than it's really bad.
I didn't like this song then i had a dream about it now i love it
if Ethan sings like this all the time, I'd like to hear more. Papa Bless.
Frank, Ethan and John..... What would that look like?
Man somethings are irreversible toll on the body and health
This video has been a family favorite for years. So glad took a swing at it and knocked it out of the park!

The only thing is this track is from 2000, not the 90's. I don't care, this was still amazing, and yeah, it still captures that sort of late 90's essence we all know and love.
only 90's kids will remember this
I think B4 4 is why Patrice Wilson now thinks it's okay to get down with kids.
I didn't see those guys blink once
Every youtuber with this illuminati shit, what the fuck is happening?
"I can see a kid watching me fuck" oshit
can we have an 80s one too!
VΛ
Actually a good singing voice
Does anyone else like the song at the end
the cringe is sooooo strong
he look like guy fieri
Did it hurt when you fell from the  orange tree?
7:21 Ethan just looks so sad and heartbroken, especially knowing now that it wasn't staged. Makes it hard to watch. He constantly breaks eye contact, as if he's disappointed in himself and regrets it, but not fully sure if it's just his Tourettes.
2:18 you're welcome
Hey Ethan, I recently went to the hairdresser's and asked for the broccoli haircut but they had no idea what i was talking about. Could you please help me achieve this look at the usual bowl haircut technique will result in a bowl cut for me because of how my hair grows
he looks like an early concept of the oompaloompas.
b 4 4 was from 2004....
I remember this song on Much Music 500 times a day.
have you tried asking Calvin?
5:10 funniest shit ever
Make a full music video
2:20 The fupa is escaping.
\//\
Why?
5:05 It can't get anymore gangster than this.
This is a clear social commentary on the blight of the urban inner city African American youth.
1990s dressing = 2016's hip shit.
I am getting tired of h3h3 videos they are not good anymore
Even when The Flithmaster 3000 says it's bad and racist, it is bad.
I'm gonna make you come tonight... over to my face. err place... I mean house
did nobody notice frank saying the n word
i thought the title said "elton johns a 90s boy band".
the things one does for youtube money...
I'm not kidding I genuinely think that Ethan could be a good singer with the right training. Am I the only one thinking this #Ethan4Rapper
Read the title as "Elton John Joins a 90s Boy band"
is Hila his girlfriend or sister
You look like a combination of Tim Heidecker and William Petersen.

Not gonna lie, I kind of wish it ended the way Apocalypse Now started
Ethan, I understand your impulse to suffer for your art.  But do you have to make us suffer too?
While a lot of Schmoyoho's work to be begin with have explicit lyric already,  the collab music video made by Schmoyoho and H3H3 does sound like those parody song in South Park.
being in that tanning cell with that woman must've felt like being in a gas chamber
If anybody is a fellow Egg fan, he talks about this song on Episode 85 of Rebirth, at around 7:20. I went searching, and I don't want anyone else to suffer through the scum.
How does hila not laugh when she records these?
KappaPride
dont hug me I'm scared
thanks for helping critikal man
I'm so late for school but it's so worth it lmao
wow your song reminds me of the Albino Dogs VEVO channel
please end every video with a vape nation  XD
Anybody else hearing some Bob Marley in Ethan's lines? 
Also: Ethan, you got one big ass, man!
You have never made a video where I haven't watch at least 10 times when you uploaded it. Seriously I can't get over your content OMFG
Only 90s kids will remember this.
I WANT A MIXTAPE ETHAN
Oh look, an aging, hypocritical, irrelevant cock juicer.
Aw ye, Ethans comin back with a nostalgia ride with the hottest 90's themed mixtape that will make you ejacu-late to school cuz you're too busy telling your friends and family about this dope ass track.
this man made me laugh.
Yes, Schmoyoho.
Man, you go a long way for comedy, and I appreciate that.
2:18 hahahaha
The song at the end totally have a Tim Heidecker feel to it ! :D
Where's the download link for the song?! I want to listen to it so badly!!
2:18
For some reason i thought the title said Elton John a 90s Boy Band.
I am just in disbelief right now lol I get it the 90's news to stay dead just please don't ever tip your hair or tan again
I wish he can upload somewhat daily because I love these videos
Did anyone manage to find the actually music video? I for the life of me can't find it and it's depressing.
90s natioon
who else was watching this in snoopavision?
Frank was on the verge of cracking up :v
The tweaked intro roll was way more jarring than it should have been. But it SUPER grows on you. xD
ethan singing sounds like damon albarn
Gold after gold.
quality video
Bronze means 3rd place, you ain't shit nigga ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"I was born in the wrong generation" anyone?
Ethan's got a nice gut man 👌👌
how expensive was this extreme makeover
haha the one in the yellow tank top looks like a more gay version of SoFloAntonio
Tbh I like the song..
My favorite part is when filthy frank says you ain't shit nigga.
those boyband boys look terrifying. They either look like Tidus, or like a goblin that will eat me.
i like how you pretend to be some dick while being  an 'actual real dick'..............   sneaky!
i like how you pretend to be some dick while being  an 'actual real dick'..............   sneaky!

The intro to Ethan's song sounded a lot like dj chub and tuck...
good lord...
Ethan literally is a meme...o.o
The legendary Fupa
Does anybody know if you can vape spray tan juice?
when Frank said "You aint shit nigga." I died laughing
Frank talking down to a spluttering Ethan was so gold it was bronze.
This song honestly goes hard by Ethan, can they release it haha
wow ethan great moves keep it up im proud of you.
i like cheesecake late at night
Never realized how big of a head you have till you were dancing /:
this caused the most laughs out of all your vids so far, keep it up ethan, take it as far as possible. i want you to take it so far that you alienate your pussy fans and attract a whole new wave of fans because of how far youre taking it
FilthyFrank's blatantly ableist remarks in order: fucking idiot, highlighter with down's syndrome, fucking stupid, fucking idiot, fucking stupid
I think we should bring the 40's back u jew
lmao dude, you should do the float tank, that would be awesome
The ending where the news reporters were watching him vape with the marijuana doo-rag on...I'm fucking dead
We need a compilation of all of Ethan's improv dancin'
13:10 Daaaamn look at those beautiful green eyes!
Great job, great moves guys keep it up. Tim and Eric would be proud
Jokes on you now you're the cutie
You and the other youtube degenerates should team up and make a feature length film.
looks like tim heidecker's dad and mac demarco's dad had a daughter and named it ethan
Jon and Frank :D
The song was actually released in 2000..........,
LOL WTF DID I JUST WATCH? Frank is right, bro..You've taken this way too far! 😂
These guys didn't live live far from me. They were from Toronto.
No one dressed like that in the 90's. The worst I ever saw was JNCO jeans, so I don't know where all the neon stuff came from.
"I'll do things to you that you.... Neverdreamed I'd do. cough".
Did filthy frank just say "you ain't shit nigga"? lol
Legit fire
8:37 "Bronze means 3rd place. You aint shit nigga". I died
I absolutely loved this hahah

"Bring 90s back" Gonna bring back Elliott smith, Nirvana, Heatmiser, every other 80s band that somehow matters
Ethan
It's time to stop
i would go down on you, h3.
OMG haha
Yas gawd. Serving up Jewish Yugi Motoh hair realness.
B44 are perfect examples of the male butterface. Like goddamn, I didn't know it was possible to be that fit and that ugly at the same time.
Wow the umpalumpas had a boy band
Donald Trump's sons? Because holy shit those tans arent normal.
You got some balls I'll give you that.
Goddammit! Where's that latest Jontron at Jon?
9:25 You are defying life man
Wow
People realize those "virtual reality goggles" are real things, right? You put a weird little disk thing on the top of it and when you hit the lever on the side, it changes the picture through the goggles
3:05 WTF ETHAN MAKING SEXUAL ADVANCES TOWARDS HIS SISTER!!!! WTF!!!
This guy is kicking ass so bad. Fuck gamers, we are truly loiving the golden age of YouTube. All my support and love to this crative, original content. 10/10

Frank:

>"ethan this tan is just taking it too far for views"
he looks like a baby body big head
I love Schmoyoho's face at 10:09
Ok I resub because you even though you are an ass, you're still comedic.
Let me know how that skin cancer goes for you
I can't handle how shameless Ethan is when he does this stuff.
I like the view of the camera in the mirror. It's like he regrets doing this.
Lmao, "PC-Bitch."
Ethan's a dick
8:34 lmao
Ethan how do you marry a beautiful woman that will film you doing all this retarded shit?

Asking for a f-friend...
bronze 5 noob
He did vape nation at the end 😂😂😂😂😂
You need to get idubbbz on a video.

stay in the sun till it looks like you have... jaundice
4:42 she sprays him in the face on purpose
Been watching your stuff for a while Ethan. You really outdid yourself this time. Really great work. Your life is a performance piece.
V/\
If there was 1 video 2 sum up the Internet.... It's this
at 11:25 his face is so bronzed that it looks like one of those clips where someone shittily super imposes someones face on another persons dancing body.
can there be a music that you've made in the end? I totally would like to listen to it as I keep replaying this video. It's so rad.... and swood

Edit : Never mind, found it
NOT GONNA LIE THIS SONG IS CATCHY AF CAN'T GET IT OUT MAH HEAD I'VE BEEN BUMPING THIS SHIT ALL DAY LONG GOD I NEED SOME HELP, PLEASE
I Caught Cancer Fr0m This :^)
Keep it Up <3
Apparently, two of the band members work at a dog camp in Canada now.
hey its that guy that Danny Sexbang replaced
So fucking desperate!!!
dude this song has potential, I hope he comes out with an album, Papa bless and vape nation
Ethan looks like he got his hair done with a flame thrower.
God.. I'm sorry, I don't think I've ever commented so much on any YouTube video but there are so many good moments here. How could you NOT laugh like that dude at 5:10? Seriously, look at all that's going on there. Lolly sucking, chub n' tucked into late 80s/early 90s pants wearing, white slicked back hair dying, wine drinking, .. and there is still more to point out, bronzed god.
I comeback just to listen to  the first line of Ethan's  song
Misleading title. I thought Ethan Bradberry joined a band. 17/10
Also, I thought this group was a boy band for teens... Despite about the most generic song ever, otherwise, they definitely get credit for the: "I'm gonna make you come tonight (three second pause) over to my house!" Imagine Hanna Montana era Miley Cyrus saying something like that in a Disney song. ... Or am I wrong about the age these guys were marketed to?
This is so weird
they all look like soflo
when Filthy Frank says you've gone too far, that's when you know you fucked up
Ok this has been bothering me the whole video, that one guy looks a little too much like soflo antonio
Wait wtf? It's BEFORE 4? That's ridiculous. Also, that's a viewmaster son, not VR. Unless you like 1 frame per ever. Yes please.
write a tumblr post about it you fucking pc bitch
lmao
S Club 7 is way better
90s sucked
That song is very Tim Heidecker. Keep it up Ethan Proud of you. I think music is the next logic step for you.
Ethan,I'm going to New York in May! I wanna meet you and we can get some frosted tips together. Keep vamping and papa bless
is it bad that i actually like that song LOL
also, am I the only one who's reminded of the beach scene in the scooby doo movie
"I have that sound too, It's my favorite sound."
Keep pumping out the great videos, you can jizz...cuzzi anytime with me.
1:18 Patrice Wilson's first breakout scene
You look like a black oompa loompa

Did anyone else see the tanning lady straight up pick her nose at 4:02?
is b4-4 proto-bubblegum bass
I was born in the wrong generation, like fucking Christ, this is real music. None of that underground hip hop rap shit that my fellow 9 year olds are into
I actually enjoyed the sound of ethans voice.
12:54 THE "AY"S LMAOOO
Backstreet boys were the shit
2010s>1990s
Frank kinda looks like the nemoidians from star wars
XD  i died when he put the cut hair back and taped it   lol
We need the song at the end as its own video
Jizzcuzzi
what kind of anime am i watching?
I've waited 4 weeks for this
That song in the end had me in tears!! Lmao awesome vid man
Hey! This song came out in 2000!

Not that it really makes a difference...
The worst part is at 2:25. See the thing at the bottom right? That's the logo for for YTV, a children's television network that would show cartoons aimed at kids 7 - 13. This was shown to children lol.
Inspired
the song at the end is fucking dank put that shit on itunes ethan
1:13 holy shit look how big Ethans head is
Odell Beckham Jr. put on some weight.
I won't lie this is definitely me when I get skin cancer
what about the back scar tho?
Filthy Frank was trying so hard not to laugh lol
2:17 I'm dead
View-Masters were suppose to be VR goggles? Yeah, I suppose so. Never thought of them like that
VN
The first guy who was singing looked like Anthony Padilla. To me at least.
I'm getting many "Borat" or even "Bruno" kind of vibes from these videos...
https://vimeo.com/132563213 you're welcome
kids in africa could have eaten that bronzer smh
I've watched this video so many times but I still laugh
Ethan you should make a video about Rick Lax. He is this creepy magician on FaceBook
Ethan is going farther and father for a goof. Could be worse though. He could be drilling himself in the head.
No shame d00d.
This guy is the epitome of confidence! Pls make a "how to be confident video"!
That first guy looks like a bronze, frost tipped sofloantonio
full song?
full song
Holy shit ! What's this guys sound cloud ?
running out of ideas you say?
It's getting hard to put up with the ads on your videos. I disabled adblocker for your channel to show support but this is the second time I had to sit through 2 minutes of the same ad being looped.
these comments have nothing to do with this video
4:21

What the fuck happened to Ethan's back? Look at that scar. Some crazy Israeli must've bashed his ass with a machete or something lmao
ämeising!
Schmoyoho is great!

Im gonna make you jizz........cuzzi with me tonight!
Loool israeli shore
2:19 great moves Ethan
They all look like weird robots and replicas of each other
That's actually a viewmaster and not VR goggles but what do I know
looks like The Soflo antonio twins got together with Cam newton to make the music video
That guy when the kid first put on the goggles looks like SoFlo
Does anyone else like his version?
I swear to god you remind me of Tim Heidecker.
Ah the 90s, when rock music was good
11:50 h3h3 new single
That Song Get Down. Is Not From The '90' Its From 2003
Don't diss the Puca. I've been wearing mine since 2010 because my great grandpa bought it for me. May he rest in peace.
reminds me of something JonLajoie would do
So hot

Ethan will never sweat again from all that tan in his pores
What a fucking god, sacrificing for his art like that. Papa bless.
You know you've gone too far when Filthy Frank calls you a racist.
You have the ass of a 50 year old female librarian.

In B4-4
Papa bless.
Just watched the greatest video.
Those pants look 80s dude

Oh my fucking god the cringe is palpable. Like, thick gooey slices of cringe. Thick.

Also, did I cause this by commenting you had tanning cream on your face on that tweet? Fuuuuuuuuck..

Also Shmoyoho was cool as fuck about all this. I can really dig that. In fact, I bet he's actually taking this someplace. Get realy for an epic follow-up!

Ethan 'im gonna make you cum tonight'
Hila 'yeah right'
Fupa game on point

You need a Rude Dog shirt
You forgot to wax your eyebrows homie.  I'd like to see a 'Where are they now' episode - perhaps you could find them and do an interview while in character.  Maybe try to join the group.  Looks like they're Canadian, so I'm sure they'd publicly apologize.
You are a revolutionary icon of fashion.
2:19 cracks me up

"Why don't you write a tumbler post about it you PC bitch!" hahaha. This is why I watch this show
she's so lucky to have that dad bod
Hey everybody 
Let me take you back 
to a magical time
Back in the 19 9 zeros
Where you could just pick up some binoculars 
And peep some hot ass cuties
Fuckin babes
It doesnt what your age
Come on with me
Lets take it!
Got to the beach and frost your tips
Stay in the sun till in looks like you have jaundice
Play some volleyball 
With some some hot babes 
Take em to your moms place
Just give em aids
Spray them aids yeah
My little brothers watching with binoculars on
It might be wrong
But in the 90s its alright
Cus im wearing my pooka shell necklace tonight
Pookashell necklace tonight 
Im gonna make you jizzcuzzi with me in the night
So far Ethan started an addictive substance and received cosmetic changes in the name of YouTube.
Someone needs to stop him before he ironically commits suicide
this has to be the funniest video you made to date
Dude, you're my fucking hero. Don't ever change.
9:40 I couldn't stop looking! I'm gay af
Wearing my pookashell necklace tonight.
i prefer the grungier side of the 90s
When you so bronze you look like an indian.
you have a good singing voice
\//\
You look a little more relaxed lately Ethan. Your eyebrows haven't been trying to escape your face as much haha
"I can see the kid watching me fuck." - Ethan 2016
2:19 WTF is he doing 😂😂
you look like an Israel carrot
Morpheus at 9:33 8^)
Who's that stupid asshole he called on skype?
The twins from B4-4 look like the Oompa Loompas in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Did...Did Hila answer..."You are?"
Anyone else think Ethan sounds like Randy Newman when he sings?
Why is no one talking about the song? It was actually good.
It started buffering immediately after Ethan said "Hila I'm gonna make you come tonight" and didn't resume for about 10 seconds it was very uncomfortable , thanks Ethan.
you are a pretty good singer Cancerthan :)
You can always tell a good vid's coming up when Ethan's hair is getting long, and he's ready for a haircut.
yey it's back, why so long without a video?
dude you schould totally colab with frank, duuude
Before Ethan started to gag on his bronzer, I blew my nose for 2 seconds straight and wanted to puke, then he gagged, I puked all over my carpet...
Why did he leave One Direction
"YOU AINT SHIT NIGGA"

bruh
HAHAHAHA holy shit fucking hilarious, thank you Ethan
DUDE THIS IS A CLASSIC! Great job bringing this vid back.
this is basically broccoli cut on a whole new level
6:40

Almost killed myself choking on my soup.
This is amazing!
lol did filthy frank say nigga hah
VΛ
4:00, the nose pick
"Im gonna make you jizz-cuzzi with me tonight" made me laugh so hard, that I had to pause the video.
john from game grumps
9:16 Dj Khaled cameo.
Ethans low key thick no homo
l could tell papa franku did some work on that track near the end, is frank truly the "papa" that ethan is always blessing?
80's for when you like hard rock, glam, metal.
90's for alternative rock and disco.
I bet those VR goggles weren't even Google cardboard... peasant.
Fuckin' Israeli carrot.
You are my hero, can not live without you. lol
it means something when filthy frank tells you you've gone to far xD
You look like you came out of a fucking Die Antwoord video.
Bradberry The Musical Please...
Cancer
YTV
I fucking love how Filthy Frank just couldn't hold the mask when he started spray-tanning himself in the face.
Ethan = Me
so you paid money to get your hair colored just to cut it off?
I find it more hilarious that the music video was made in 2000 by Canadians, and the song was #4 on their charts.
9:36 bites lip Dat ass.
the clothes in the beginning were totally 80s btw. -.-
FUCK YEAH
Finally some more real H3H3
Holy shit that song got me in the end.
Is that the same place that franku prank called to look like whoopi goldberg
I'm gonna make you jizz...cuzzi with me tonight!
I wish I could look as good as Ethan one day.
so glad I subbed to this dude
lol northernlion talked about this song once
1978 dislikes because he went blackface
Such sarcasticly unironic kinkshaming.

only 90's kids remember h3h3
Wow Ethan! Great Vocals! keep it up! Proud of you!
I'm gonna make you jizz                     cuzzi with me tonight
Is this the new Max Payne game?
I love how the New York subway commuters literally could not care.
"you look like a highlighter with down syndrome"
Ethan you need to release a full length version of this song.
#BringThe90'sBack
End my suffering.
wonder how he looks like now
duane!
Hahahaha Jesus Papa Bless you Ethan.

Ethan pls.. Im at school...
Almost forgot to watch it today
people in my class won't stop making vape nation signs

this channels fanbase is going down a dark path
2:18
No offense but when i see you like that, you look like the 5th teletubby
I was hoping that Tim & Eric from Awesome show would have joined your 90's boy band
I'm disturbed at myself for thinking Ethan looks kinda hot like this.
"born in the wrong generation"
The song was actually pretty good. I recorded it and set it as my ringtone.
I gotta say i thought you lost your touch ethan, but this was the best video you have put out in a while imo
when is this going to be available on ITunes ?
IS THAT TIM SINGING
Jizzcuzzi
AWESOME VIDEOS! Funny stuff.  Hila is a lucky lady. haha

At 5:10, I lost it.

The saddest thing is that those guys are wearing a tank top under the first tank top to look bigger
definitely one of h3's worst videos, sorry ethan this one just isnt funny.
how can you not love Ethan?
Damn Ethan, great moves. Keep it up.
This went way deeper than I expected
It was worth the wait
I think its awesome that Ethan and Frank know each other =D
Highlander with down syndrome lmao dead
I dont think a black kid in the 90's wanna see Blonde White Guy in a goggles!
Nooo...god no. Its the fucking broccoli cut...god help me.
If his band isnt called "Ethan & The Bradberries", i'm going to be pissed.
The things Ethan does for videos
9:40 Ethan's thick as fuck
9:20 a wild DJ Khaled appeared!
I'm gonna make you come...





That's it. Bye
You look like diarrhea
Ethan = brazilian
Ethan = Favelado
They're literally terrifying? Like they look like they were created in a lab
Omg. this is hilarious. I'm embarrassed that I had one of those puka shell necklaces back in the day xD
13:14 those are the eyes of a man undergoing mid-meme crisis
only 90's kids will remember. LIEK IF U'RE A TRU 90'S KID
You ain't shit, my nigga
"you look like an Israeli Carrot'
Like x 1000!
Damn Ethan back at it again with another H3H3 video!
Fucking hell I only realised that two of the guys in b4-4 are twins, I mean, all these bands look the same anyway
... But the song is not from the 90s?
Im actually diggin that cut Ethan
"You look like a highlighter with down syndrome" LMAO
4:02 -_-
I'm really glad i subbed to this channel; laughed my arse off.
when will your song be on Itunes?
"I'm gonna make you jizz.........cuzzi with me tonight"
Ethan don't talk to me or my son ever again
I was born in '99. I totally understand everything you are talking about as a 90s kid. - Comment Section
at 4:45 ethan almost looks mexican
Usually I support Ethan, but then this happens 😔
what have we done to deserve papa ethan
I always knew umpa lumpas could make a career in music
Please turn that into an actualy song, that was fucking hilarious.
Papa Bless your soul, because you fucking need it.
I watched this on my gear VR lol
Are you pregnant Ethan?
Can I get a VapeNation in the Chat
The one with the white frosting hair kinda looks like SoFloAntonio.
wtf
Ethan dancing at 2:22... OMG this comedy gold!
do you know how to breath in before you spray tanner in your face? :P jesus dude!
you're just sitting there dying  spraying it on urself lol
INB44 VR
This is new fucking heights for h3h3. I'm dying.
wow ethan, great ass, keep it chunky!
CUS BABY NOW WE GOT BAD BLOOD
"Why don't you write a Tumblr post about it, you PC bitch!"
Possibly the best quote on the internet.  Papa Bless.
Frank sounds like the ghouls from fallout
VapeNation V/\
"Try and stop me from bronzing!!! Dude" 😂😂😂
DJ Khaled @ 9:17?
Is H3H3 turning to a prank channel?
Papa bless
I won't lie. Ethan suffers for his art.
When you freak out Filthy Frank you know you are taking it too far...
I kinda feel sorry for Ethan spraying a crap ton of bronzer on his face. ;-;
I don't know about you guys, but I think Jontron is fucking adorable
only 90s kids will understand this
Ethan sounds like Wayne Coyne when he sings.
Just 3 words for a question: iTunes album: when?
Anyone jizz....cuzzi with me....?
IM FUCKIN CRYING WTF
ethan, i'm so glad you're sick and have your coughing back!
This is a combination of cancer and satire,we need a new word for this. ANYBODY THINK OF ONE,COLLECT HERE IN A REPLY,let's figure this one out.
Ethan you tried way to hard in this. It wasn't funny
Great now my favorite childhood band has turned into a meme and everyone knows about it. gj h3h3.. gfg
4:01 she goes for that sweet bronze
make full song plz
lol wtf.. I always think I miss the 90s certain things where better back then (music and imo movies and video games).. But I definitely don't miss these clothes and shit (although I think fashion nowadays is weird too... I hate skinny jeans) ...I remember everyone wearing those huge raver pants where the bottom was open so wide it would like cover your entire shoe lolol. And I used to be a skater and think I was a badass and I remember trying to skate with sagging pants and shit lol ridiculous. Shit like that.
amazing :) :) :)
is that actually bradberry???
I felt so uncomfortable watching this
pls full version of the song
Ethan, u remind me of not caring about external fucklery i shouldn't be worryin about to begin with. Baba Pless
Did you leave your tip at 5:03?
why whyyyy why are they singing the song too a little kid like dafuq
Best Video Ever.
Nice video Ethan! Reminds me a lot of Filthy Frank's longer videos, and thats great!
this One is so funny  haha
9:30 Is that Christopher Judge following him?
THIS is the type of content creator that deserves 2mil+ subs.
2:23 he looks pregnant
dude is hilarious
He should do a video about tobuscus
took him. 3 weeks to get his courage back to upload
I just love it how Ethan doesn't give the smallest fuck about what people think of him.
I'm not gonna lie but for a minute I thought it was Ethan Bradberry who joined a 90s boy band.
don't do crack, kids.
subscribed
Lets stick to vape nation
Stop
V/\ in the end
Ethan, no matter what you do, I plead you, do not change that intro in an attempt to "update" the channel or make it fresh. It's perfect, and always will be.
shit just got real
WOW, best video yet
best h3h3 up to date
looks like kramer
anything for youtube views
can I download this song?
I'd rather see ETHAN BRADBERRY join a 90s band.
7:05 papa franku's skype leaked
Lol Ethan looks like a paki.
hila give me the succ
This shit was HILARIOUS!! Lol
Why was this song airing on ytv? Is this why millennials are so stupid?
According to wikipedia, they were active from 1999 to 2004, so they were just in there, but this has to be the most innocent oral sex song ever
I was really hoping Jon and Frank were going to go boyband and join him haha
"gonna make you come tonight..over to my house"  NorthernLion, anyone?
I was born in 1999 does that count
Never Go Full 90's...
please
just make one music video, you , jontron and frank all dressed like a 90s boygroup, real fucking cheesy and gay like your song
pls more Vape nation Videos
this was a high quality video, it was worth the wait, but they couldve made some more smaller videos inbetween. even just 1 video on the h3h3 channel wouldve been enough
You look like a tyrannosaurus rex.
What's the song when he was said that he made a mistake
THIS IS FUCKING GOLD!
actually this song was from 2003
You should have posted the music video different from the video. Think about the Youtube money. Pfft rookie
Papa bless
SoFlo and Sean would be edgy band mates
I guess JonTron taught him how frequently to release a video...
I love all H3H3 videos, but this takes the cake as the best H3H3 video
i lost my shit at 2:20.  Wow, Ethan great moves!
How about YMCA and the song with Tom Cruise ,"Playing with the Boys"
        Those were the best 90's boy's band ever!
Ethan now that you have this bronzed, god-like body wid dem frosted tips and all those cum-inducing bracelets, I think it's time you get back out there with the hot fuckin kissing pranks because at this point it's just not even fair
After 3 weeks (rolling my eyes)
'bronze means third place', lmao
3:07 "Hilla, im gonna make you come tonight... over to my house!... And then I'm gonna make you cum tonight."
I'm going to have this fucking song stuck in my head for the next decade thx Ethan.
3:46
ah, the sharkjumping commences
We need Pewdiepie rant NOW!
Was the Tumblur thing a reference to the Toby Turner situation?
Priceless nose picking @4:02
This is hilarious!
Wow! Ethan! Great job. Keep it up, proud of you!
overdoing it.
this song came out in 2003 though, not the 90s
Was that MLW making the song for him?
Dude, that's not VR it's a ViewMaster.
Sincerely,
An '80s kid.
This is great
Does anyone see soflo in one of the singers
"Bronze means 3rd place... You ain't shit nigga" HAHAHAH 8:34
you look like a gay puerto rican, like my uncle when he was younger
The funniest thing about this is how the song Get Down actually came out in 2000
I NEED A FUCKIN SUBTITLE FOR THAT ENDING SONG!
Filthy frank
Whats wrong faggot cant answer simple questions?
the 90s were fucking warped. It was the onslaught of noobs to our great internet. Look how far it's fallen :0
Looks like that little boy jizzed his pants at 1:56
9:19 the guy with the beats, DJ Khaled?
Dit Jon say Israelian carrot ? 😄
06:38 You like a avocado had sex with an older avocado huehue
5:15 That dude walking buy like "Classic white people antics, just classic"
''You know what bronze means? It means third place nigga'' xD
how old is ethan?
I honestly just spent 10 minutes going keyframe by keyframe trying to see if I can see joji, or ethan's skype names.....i'm not creepy I swear.
wow, ethan. GREAT moves! Proud of you.
hahaha xD
i just lmao'd i laughed. my .asssss.off shit i dont have a fucking ass
Ethan perfectly draws the line between glorious irony and pure cancer.
smh tbh not believing in ethan quarter past 1 before 5 4 b
Damn, Jon's a pretty good actor.
you know you are wayy ahead your mind when papa franku mentioned how ridiculous is this 😂😂😂
Ethan stop walking your making earthquakes in Japan you Cancer
V.N bro
#isethankleindied
12:21 Clinical depression
Ahhh remember when colored people where animals....well now white people paint themselves to look like us!!!
That song's my new jam
"You look like a highlighter with downs" -FIlthyFrank Will be using that one.
#Anything4YoutubeViews
FALSE, B44 didnt release Get Down until 2000 and their first album didn't release until 2000.
I'd love to see a reaction to dramaalert or keemstar, but I think people would get pissed for some dumb reason
This week on Geordie Shore...
this is it, papa! this is the kind of video we like to see from h3h3


u look like a bulgarian male prostitute, tho
funiest thing might be that the song was actualy good xD..
Probably my favourite video by you dude omg
Damn this shit is catchy AF

And when is this coming to iTunes?
That is commitment
Morpheus behind ethan at 9:32? Matrix confirmed?
so worth the wait dude
The best thing about this video is that this song didn't even come out until 2003.
lmfao he actually looks way better with the tan
Holy shit. We just witnessed a mortal ascend into a puss smash mEmE God. Hail the papa's.
"those little negros tend to search trough the garbage" - thought process of a clipmaker

This is my favorite YouTube video!!
b4-4? Wait.... 4 + 4 = 8 .......  b8?    GR8 B8 M8

Anybody else get rekt at 10:56?
Ethan... make more music please
Born in 1999 ! Still a 90s kid doh!
Bronze dude is Tidus?
why do all 3 of them look so simalar
I will say, I am glad Ethan and MaxMoeFoe haven't done a video.

Don't sell out papa..
the guy with the  yellow shirt looks exactly like febiven from fnatics lol team
Feel confident of your spray tan @4:03 as the tech picks her nose, no way that got blasted on your body bro, no way!
If you listen to Get Down backwards you can hear the actual meaning the artists intended: they say "HELP I AM BECOMING CHOCOLATE".
the moment you realise this song was released in the 21st century, anyway great moves Ethan, keep it up, proud of you
Is that song on itunes? that's so lit.
hila's probably either like: "I love him. this is exactly why I married Ethan." or: "What. the. actual. fuck, Ethan? this is too much"
This is definitely me when I'm wearing my pucca shirt necklace tonight. Ey ey ey eyeyeyyeyyyyyey3eeeeey.
This was glorious
Just one thing, guys....This song is from May, 2000
Someone upload Ethan's song separately please its actually really good
I truly think this is your best video yet
Bronze is third place, number three. In chinese that is san, which is like your look, the sun. When people look at it their eyes are damaged and burnt.






Jk keep up the great work
Damn dude, you guys have outdone yourselves! This is setting the bar for all future videos, easily the best thing you've done so far.
I hope to one day be as shameless as Ethan
i'm gonna get down on everyone NOW
I'll jizz  cuzzi with you tonight Ethan
Lol every single time Ethan needs a haircut he does some dumb shit with it first.
Fucking jew
If the Bradberries had a boyband
You ain't shit nigga
You know you've truly crossed the line when FilthyFrank tells you you've taken it too far.
9:32 Lawrence Fishburne
Any chance a full song release? Papa Please :D
It's a 00's boyband dude.
finally you upload a video Jesus!
if you release the song on iTunes I will happily buy it.
I was hoping it was Ethan Bradberry that joined the boys band.
This was hilarious!
k00l
Another great video
Damn, Ethan and Hila back at it again with the dank memes
ARE YOU CRAZY 
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND 😤😤😤😤👌👌👌
go to any frat, theres still dudes lookin like this.
this reminds me of i was born in wrong generation
2 old lady faces and a bulldog face all with the same exact dubbed voice.
Unsubscribed
5:40 So basically just Justin Timberlake.
Nice chair, get it from costco? I have the same one. Pretty solid purchase I must say.
Jizzcuzzi
have I ever laughed harder? 

Nope. 

Does Ethan look like a fucking Israeli nationalist who runs a convenience store in the Bronx?

Absolutely.
I'm genuinely concerned
Vape Nation brah
wow ethan
bad move
don't keep it up
im not proud of you
B4-4 were really creepy and threatening. That's probably why they lost out to other boy bands.
Did frank say nigga at 8:35
Ethan your comedy is a 10.. I would have joined your boy band just as long as Patrice Wilson isn't involved. JonTron you need to get more videos out, damn man get you're shit together.
Damn, Ethan getting all method actor-y and shit.
JONTRON AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH <3
dad why did you leave me?
i ain't gay but ethan has a rly nice ass i mean hila must rly like what he's got there cause i mean it looks like you could bounce a QUARTER off that thing it looks so damn toned or something ughhhh

but i ain't gay
Bronze on these nuts, faggot.
omg... Ethan is one of the funniest guys on Youtube.  Hands down.
One thing nobody can take away from you is that god damn dedication.
"Bronze means 3rd place"
That cough is amazing
Fuck! This was funny.
So... Boys 12?
"Bronze means third place." Lmao, damn.
Nice moves Ethan
Holyyy shiiit
think I damaged some organs laughing at this one omg, good shit guys!
Still blacker than Donald glover also
How fucking sweaty does Ethan get this video
I'm gonna make you jizz..cuzzi with me tonight.
Jizzcuzzi made me laugh more than it should have made me laugh lol
timber timbre - beat the drum slowly. it's just like this
Vape Naysh'in in the 90's, ya'll.
Dude, that song was released in 2000. 

\//\
Subbed since 100,000 great content
That's a viewfinder, ya retard. Not "VR Goggles".
Spray tanning lady nose pick. Great vid 10/10
U should post the song by itself so i can save it lol
Legend
did I hear wrong or did I hear that raspy voice guy say "you ain't shit ni**er" at 8:36......
"I'm gonna make you jizz---cuzzi with me" LMAO
ethan gives no fucks
My fucking god good thing I didn't grow up in the 90s Id probably have cancer
13:10 Ethan is DJ Khaled confirmed
10/10
Please put the song on iTunes. Papa bless
The members of that band all look like Shanta Ronaldo
spray them aids yeah!!!
But wait... Didn't "Get Down" come out in 2003? Sorry if I didnt get a joke or something...
Am I the only one who loved his voice
you ain't shit nigga - FilthyFrank 2016
The dialogue of this video made me imagine Ethan and Hila's sex life, and I am not sure I'm ok with that.
how many times has ethan ridiculously cut his hair for a video? lol that's dedication
Did Ethan really just get a fucking spray tan for his subscribers?! Holy shit I love this channel!
i've noticed you have a surgical mask on why don't I have one? LMFAO
And this is why you're one of the best You Tubers out there, you go above and beyond with the things you do for videos. Papa Bless.
4:59 the best shot i've ever seen thank you so much papa bless
Didn't like the song. No Bradberrys anywhere.
I think the best part about this is that the "Get Down" song came out in 2000. Which, to be fair, I remember that being a period where the 90s was still a strong presence, but it's cutting it rather close for a video about 90s boy bands.
Why does Ethan look like a GTA online character at 09:25
I would non-ironically listen to music if Ethan was the singer. Make it happen. papa bless
HAHAHAHAHA THAT DANCE WAS HILARIOUS
when youre so short on content you start to review old 90s music videos that no one here knows or cares about.
I love you and I want to have your babies!
i loved this video, i love you Ethan, rock on man
I jizzed when franku came in
I'd join a band with an Israeli carrot. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) papa bless
I want to get beyond bronze, I want to get bleached
That pink shirt gave me cancer ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
>tfw Ethan takes it farther than Filthy Frank
VOLKOR HAS HIS OWN MUSIC VIDEO!!!!
"You look like a highlighter with Down syndrome" literally died lol XD
THIS IS FUCKING GOLD
Why does this have 1k dislikes? This is by far your best video.
that spray tan is actually legit
The 90's were awesome! Boy Bands,not so much.
Thanks for helping out Critkal!
was i the only one waiting for frank to hit em with the "it's time to stop"???
your tourette's hasn't been as bad lately
does ethan have trex syndrome <3
Dude Ethan has some serious self confidence to be walking about in public like that man lmao.
omg I want to meet him and he was right around house at the end.
Did anybody notice that this song was actually made in the 2000's and not the 90's?
"Get Down" came out in 2000...just saying.
lol that outfit looked like my lesbian middle school teacher from way back when. i wish i was joking.
ethan's ass looks sooo good
Not gonna lie, Ethan didn't sound that bad. Pretty good?
FilthyFrank is the politically correct one?

What kind of world do we live in?
I cant find the Get Down mv. Can somebody send me the link?
I'm so fucking happy H3H3 is back in original form words can't express
Please tell me where I can get some yellow sweatpants like those. Papa bless 🙏🏼
no fucking shame. its great.
\/\
worst h3h3 video so far
Whenever Frank says you ain't shit nigga I can't help but dying
I think one of my favorite things about these videos is Hila and how she's just cool with all the retarded shit Ethan is doing.
Oml what has this turned into😂😂😂😂
Our grandchildren ain't gonna believe shit from our bedtime stories about our childhood XD
Hahahha!!! Love the videos man!! You should make another vape nation video!
You're reaching Ray William Johnson 2009 levels
I'm not going to lie, this is definitely me when I'm in a mid life crisis
Can someone tell me why Michelle Obama is in his intro telling him he has "great moves, keep it up"
one of the funniest men on the internet. Thanks for helping cr1tikal get his channel back btw :D
Ayyy this was posted on my Birthday.
Ethan, I know in a recent video you said that making these videos are very tiring and that's why there hasn't been much content but if this is what we have in store for the future, take as much time as you need. This is by far one of the most creative and funny videos you've done so far. Papa Bless!
im not gonna lie... this was legit catchy
this video makes me happy.
Great moves, keep it up.
patrice wilson should be in those goggles
holy shit h3 got mad collab game
all for a video...
you know you fucked up when even filthy frank tells you you went over the line
Audio wasn't nearly compressed enough to feel authentic
Ethan I love you man but damn that belly has gotta go
This video made me be reborn with down syndrome.
thanks for help Critikal papa. Uncle really needed it
definitely not a fan of filthyfrank
the pilot hat meme has trancended channels.
Damn, Ethan's got  some pipes!
I wish I was an orange too
So when is the full album coming out?, i can't wait to sing about kids in weird adult situations.
Behold Ethan Klein the master of disguise.
god, I'm still having lewd hila dreams.
Friends give friends Jaundice.
im going to make you come tonight hila...
...you are?
DAMN ETHAN YOU GOT ROASTED.
This song reminds me of my childhood in bible school!
It was a heavy blow to the band when Jon didn't join.
Dang Ethan is thiccc
I swear to god Hila is Kristen Wiig's long lost twin
Ayeeee remember to vote on Tuesday... Ethan! (establishing a personal connection) (HEAVY BREATHING)
Whenever I see the guy with the yellow shirt, all that I see is Tidus from FFX. IS THIS THE INSPIRATION?
U look like u slipped and fell in an oven and came as a fresh batch of cookies.
I genuinely miss the 90's.
6:10 lik if u cri evrytim
Put the full song at the end on iTunes please.

New H3h3 video!! FeelsGoodMan

ethan is the best.
Damn d00d you look like a Puerto Rican lol Keep it up. Great moves.
listen here you retard fuck
jizzcuzzi LMAO
holy shit. just, like, the amount of effort put into this is astounding. i love you. this is what the internet was made for. somewhere, Tim Berners Lee is punching the air shouting, "yes, this is exactly what I dreamed it would be".
Ethan are you crazy?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! giant oompa loompa looking mf imma sic ethan bradberry on your ass.
Do you understand what he`s done for us? DO YOU?! He suffered, he changed his very skin and hair so that we could laugh. acKNOWLEDGE that! #EthanDyedForUs #YoutubeMessiah 



#HesJewishTheresYourProof
JOntron! Ekh!
That bronzer makes Ethan's head abnormally huge.

This video went from weird to WhatTheactualFuck
Vape Nation
You are by far one of the best YouTube channels to grace this website these days, I'd join your boy-band.
A E S T H E T I C
He is so precious i like him so so much...
You know you done goofed big time when even filthy frank says you fucked up.
Ethan the type of nigga to actually bring the 90s back
Ethan looks like you've packed on a couple of pounds!!! SEXY
9:41 I THOUGHT THAT WAS DAVID TENNANT!
Je comprend très bien l'anglais mais j'aime mettre des com que personne ne comprend . J'ADORE SON TRAVAIL à ce jeune gourgandin.Big up mon gros

Wow Ethan!  You finially look the way I Imagine you at night!
Ryan Higa and Etan(&Hila) are my favorite Youtubers by far... so fucking funny^^^

That intro surprisingly works with that music
9:37 damn he thicc
But this song was released in 2000...

b4-4 didn't release a song until the year 2000
wheathin bradberry
I want Ethan and Pink Guy to drop a mixtape
Absolutely one of H3H3's best.
Kevin is a cunt.
Go to the beach and frost your tips
You've gone full 90's boy band... Never go full 90's boy band
This musical wave was circa 2000 - 2004. It was not the 90s.
im etatenbradbbereyy
9:16 is that dj khaled in the background.
Is it just me, or does Ethan's hair frosted look like wholly carpet?
I think Ethan was slowly turning into George Michael over the course of the vid
Insta-sub
i can't believe JonTRon hangs out with this cunt, Jon please come back to game grumps, please.
Ethan is Ted Bundy. Google him their hair is identical, I consider Ethan a beefed up version of him.
only 90's kids remember the apartheid
FINE I liked and subscribed. It's funny that it took you going to 11 to earn my loyalty...I guess I have high standards. I got a boner when Frank was roasting you. Very nice.
omg ethan the things you do for youtube XD I'm crying right now

Why does Ethan sound like Anthony Kiedes?
Lel she put her fingers in her nose, while trying to sell something  ? 4:00
"How does it feel to not have any shame," - Peggy Hill 1997
lol Ethan kinda looks like Claudio Sanchez when he has a tan x'D
is this on the Vape Gods LP
Need a sequel to this as soon as possible. Try to contact Darren Aronofsky, he might be totally into the subject and you can pay him with the imaginary million from your beenie non-sale
That moment when you look at his clothes at the start, and he looks like your grandma on the beach going into the sea
Oh my god
Ethan you just guaranteed skin cancer for yourself.
If Ethan Bradberry Made a boy band.
Ethan is a legend!
Thank you so much for helping Cr1tikal!!!!! Much respect
Dude in yellow tank top looks like SoFlo
When does Ethan's hot single drop???
well, fwiw, you looked less like a lesbian than your idols did, sounded almost as good.
My balls smell like goat cheese dipped in vinegar.
When he pulled out a picture of the boy band I fucking lost it
you look like a mix between pritchard and pancho from dirty sanchez
make the server in the backround with  johntron a meme
Fruanku: "That's blackface. That's racist. You know what bronze means? Bronze means third place. You ain't shit, nigga" 8:30
he looks like donald trump
Is it me or is Jon wearing a fur cap?
You can tell when Ethan was talking to Filthy Frank he was about to burst out laughing at any moment and kept spraying himself to keep in character xD.
IMETHANBRADBERRY
B4-4 notices an upswing in their music video plays and decide now's the time for a come...back.
"Israeli Carrot" "A highlighter with Down Syndrome" "You're kind of like that guy's strange cousin"
Every episode of H3 I feel like we get closer and closer to Ethan doing a ball slip.

ay
@11:11 shit man, my connection to the internet died at the peak of "the word that would exist if this had ever happened in the past". #vape90snation

The video they reacted to, the song gave me a stroke xD
Why, God? Why?
i actually kinda liked the  song at the en
How drunk does he need to get to do these videos?
best video yet, the song was my favorite part
What's more 90's was that YTV logo at 2:23 jesus
React to vitalyzdtv's leaked gay porn video
Be yourself, unless you can be the 90's.

"You Look Like a... 
A Israeli Carrot"- Jontron 2016
The absolute Madman
The way Ethan looks in this video makes me feel so creeped out and uncomfortable. kudos
Anyone else notice JonTron is wearing the same outfite from his Blizzard Rant vid?

SUICIDE
Băi țigane.

Bronze is wack, I wanna be a silver Q-tip!

Great stuff Ethan, proud of you.

I  laughed way to hard at 2:14
HAHAHA
That is alot of cameos there, Ethan.

you have alot of friends... i wish i had friends... :I
Ethan has been stepping shit up, holy fuck. Amazing stuff.
I really think the second half of the 90's is still in shock over Kurt cobain and doesn't know what to do
Ethan is just the funniest guy on youtube
NO CHILL
that ad placement, i like that
Ethan bad moves disappointed in you
Heart, spirit and dreams. All that in just 13 minutes.
This is fucking terrifying.
4:27
#fuckleafy
When he said he said he had one more friend I knew it was Frank
Reminds me of Patrice Wilson.
"I'm gonna make you jizz...cuzzi"
9:30 holy shit. it's Morpheus!
Ethan kinda looks like Russel Wilson with all that bronzer
Ethan...






That was beautiful
This truly is the bronze age of YouTube. Bronzer, excuse me.
Out of everything in the video I look at his eyebrows they slay pussy
9:17 DJ Khaled ?
Ethan can you fix the spacing between those pictures in your house. I would really appreciate it.
ONLY 90'S KIDS REMEMBER.
I really wish jon and frank would have joined the boy band.
The shit Ethan does for his videos. Papa bless.

h3h3 is the best reacter of youtube
This and Vapenation. You guys are killing it lately
Time to bring Big E and 2pac again

i loose it when hes dancing at the recording studio
I want to tell you a secret








Likr or you will get 1000 years of bad luck
If you think about it, all these videos are really just shot from Hilas perspective. So its like your watching Ethan and Hila have and adventure but from Hilas Pov
2:12 have mercy

This is the BEST video on Youtube! Ethan you da BEST!
The song is lowkey dope
I'll get down on you :)
H3H3 goes to the Jersey Shore!!!! Sex! Kissing Pranks!
And I thought "Vape Nation" was a ballsy move.
In my opinion, this is your best video yet, I laughed my fucking ass off :')
JON GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER AND MAKE JONTRON YOU SILLY BITCH
Who remembers the band 'BUSTED'. That was my jam XD.
song name?
That dance in the studio was classic Eric Wereheim
I honestly dont know what to say other than i am entertained
Yo this is like some Black Swan drama shit at the end.
ethan has a really bad dark side
The game has changed
You guys do know the black kid in the beginning of the video is actually Patrice Wilson ? He got the same creepy smile and everything ! Google it, it's actually fucking him LMAO
11:23 great moves Ethan
Ethan looks like a sour patch kid on meth
I grew up in the 90s, and I can't even believe this shit was a thing.  It looks so clowny and ridiculous.
View master, not VR.
WOW ethan great vid keep it up proud of you
I definitely enjoy meme creator H3H3 over meme discoverer H3H3
You know you're fucked when Filthy Frank tells you to get your shit together.
I was born in the wrong generation
damn inhaling the spray tan isn't really healthy dude....
Why do these guys look like an ungodly mix of the bradberry boys
Wow. Keep it up Ethan.
#bronzegod
OKAY. STOP. WAIT.

I know people comment with stuff like, "I laughed so hard I cried XD LULZ* every single time. But this time, I legitimately laughed so hard that my mind was torn asunder when that lady was spraying Ethan in the Spray Tan thing. I think I'll have PTSD after that one.
8:00 IT'S JUST A TAN BRO
Is this god?
israeli carrot
So when can I expect the full single?
 I WANT THIS
I was born in the wrong gemeration
He ended up looking like someone you see at Walmart
Ethan has the clean cut charm of a boy band frontman.
Full version of the song?
where can i get ethan's song?
the time and effort you out in... you are amazing man
Not REALLY?!
only 90's kids will remember this spicy meme
Ethan you a fucking legend. Thanks for helping Cr1tikal out! Such a classy move
"You look like an Israeli carrot"
I dont even know what i just watched but it was pretyy great
This is truly a work of art.
Wtf, I got unsubscribed from you???
EVERYONE WORSHIP THESE HERE MEME GODS
Jesus Christ man.
The guy that started singing first looks a bit like soflo
He stared into the abyss for too long...
so this is why JonTron doesn't post anymore.
you look like a highlighted down syndrome
The commitment bro
I just want to say Ethan, thank you for helping critkal ( if that's how u spell it) out, he is one of my most favourite youtubers thanks a lot 


Love,

Black guy.
you ain't shitt nigga haha 8:37
wtf did i just watch?
Where  can i download that beautiful jizzcuzi song?
The really hilarious thing is that the original lyrics had such wafer-thin double entendres.
Ethan looks so good with that tan. Like an exotic jewish flower from the east.
Ethan is the hero youtube deserves, but not the one it needs right now..
What the f***, Ethan? :D
This video was amazing . You've perfected the reaction video . It's a skit and a reaction in one its so beatiful
Its that a scar on your  back??
#HitlerKilledTheWrongPeople
Why does Frank always check up on Hila?  He trying to get dat Jew pussy I see.
4:02 searching for golden nuggets ?
" This isn't about you right now..."11:10 lol!

Thank you Ethan for helping Cr1tikal

At this point, I could see Ethan getting a sex change
Wow Ethan great moves, keep it up, proud of you.
i grew up in the 90s, literally born in 1990 and i hated it XD kind of worried now people have started acting like the 90s was cool it was hella cheesey though
This reminds of the old days of YouTube when channels do crossover skits with other youtubers for fun and not for promotion.
I wanna pet your pussy

Good
This hila looks very frigid, not good in bed
9:18, DJ Kali in the background wtf.
"I know you see Ethan's sexy thicc ass. If he has a fupa, I am that fupa."
This is definately be when i'm 1/4 to 1, after 5 which is Before 4,  therefore making me 5 aka B5 & 1/4 to 1 o'clock before B5 as before 4 there was B3,  but i am after 4 so i am actually B5 because they are B4 and there is only 1 of me,  making me 1/4 to 1 aka 1/4 to 1, B55 !
I can't believe Jontron was in this video.  Makes me happy to see they're friends who at least can collaborate for a 1 minute session =D.
"Look at his frosted tips" My sides now occupy a stationary orbit around the earth XD
Noodle hair lookin ass BOI
Only 1690's kids will understand this video.
Thats some fuckin dedication 5:05
@8:37 U AIN'T SHIT NI**A xD
5:04 it was past this moment I felt the body was going to hit the floor, and my eyes start crying. tears. I love this guy more than Shrek is love.
\//\

This week on My Strange Addiction...
i can't even think of a word to describe how funny this was for me.
Jontron, H3h3, and FilthyFrank in the same video. There is a waterfall in my pants.
11:47 You're Welcome
Our goofs and gaffs have reached a new level. What a beautiful time to be alive.

You know frank burst into laughter after every cut
My favourite video of all time! Definitely!!! MOOOOOREEEEEEEE musssiiiic!!

At first it sounded like Peter griffin singing in Ethan's song
FILTHY DAD

Yep I know how you feel.  Roll on old age and death it can't come fast enough
ethans h3ad looks bigger than before i think its the tan.
Its gonna be weird for the next few months.
What are you on this time? :D
The end of this video reminded me of Too Many Cooks where Snarf goes crazy and blows himself up.
FINALLY NEW VID
This is probably the best channel to ever be on YouTube.
h3h3 and cr1tikal collab pls papa bless
Great vid
Ethan's a funnier character than we've had before if we could just get him working.
I lost it at "You look like an Israeli carrot."
Ethan you are a saint for helping out critikal
Dude I love all the support you are getting.
its just a prank bro
This gave me cancer
AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE AYE
I love how different and fresh this video is :)
I want to join Ethan's band, anyone wanna come .... And join?

7:05 "You know, one of these days, you're gonna give your friend that talk. (....) You're gonna have to tell him he's not gonna make it in the music industry."  



Filthy Frank, "Bad Internet Rappers" I remembered that episode almost immediately :)

But now, I understand. What a time to be alive.
12:10 too perfect to be real.
Only 90s kids will remember
im ethan bradberry
Anyone else feel he should make that a real song? It was too fucking funny.
When you guys make a video you are all in! I appreciate the dedication.
He looked kinda like Robert Downey Jr.
This is bronze! I'd say gold but, it's not as good.
Im pretty sure making that song took more effort than making a generic pop song nowadays
low-key looks like Riff Raff
Ethan is truly the master of the chub N' tuck
This is gold, just like your tan
jizzcuzzi
you're insane. love it
thank you so much for helping Cr1TiKaL stay on youtube Ethan
VapeNation
Ethan is that Hila's shirt?
New York is an amazing place lol
Such pinache.
I thought you meant Ethan Bradbury joined a 90's band Im sad now
Ethan, you need a shitty soul patch or a goatee to truly belong in a 90s boy band. There weren't full beards on the 90s.
Why is Tidus serenading a little boy
Ethan, John and Papa Franku best combo
Is it wrong that I think Ethan looks sexy as shit?
Why is he sweating so much!?
#BringBackThe90s
You know what bronze means?! Bronze means third place! You ain't shit nigga!
holy fuck h3's vids have been amazing lately. so funny good job
This is my favourite video of yours so far :D
Hila is still in the 90's, clothing wise.
Ethan and Hila, this is the greatest. Papa bless you hard. Down some sodie pops to celebrate this masterpiece.
Some bomb ass vids Ethan and Hila keep it up.
This is the greatest thing I'll ever see.  I'm sad because it's all downhill from this moment.
was he sweating
'you aint shit nigga' my favorite part lmao
What the banana peel wiener weeaboo dick sausage fucktard faggot nigga sick ass fucking retard maggot slamming son of a whore slippy hotdog buns is that!!!!!!!!!!
Wait why was that on YTV, a song about fellatio on a children's TV channel.
This was almost too much chub to handle
Ethans ass in those shorts make me hard, no homo though.
Man he could have made it in Germany. We loved D.Hasselhoff (chubby and tanned) and Boybands. So Ethan is the perfect hybrid. Like a geneticaly advanced boybandish version of david. Cheers!
Ethan you are fucking gold when you do this kind of shit.
I always said he looked like aziz ansari. This video is proof that I'm not crazy because he REALLY fuckin looks like aziz ansari w the tan.
The effort put into these videos is insane, haha. Literally got a tan, died your hair yellow, shaved a stupid line in the middle and choke on spray tan numerous times. Keep up the good work Ethan, this was fucking awesome haha. #VapeNation
is that fuxin bbq sauce?????????????
Am I the only one whos glad frankus shaved his chin pubes...? Or should I say... Chin-chin pubes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)...
somethingt has lowerd the bar
this guy has no self shame xd
I love swimming in my jizzcuzzi
Jizz-cuzzi killed me.

I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Great moves ethan, keep it up. Rep that Vape Nation, Papa Bless.
Great video...
You should watch BarryBeeTV some cool kissing pranks.
Is this a challenge to shoenice to eat a can of bronzer?

>Humans 2016
Im very proud actually.
I always tell people that i'm not asian I just have jaundice
We have entered the Bronzed age of YouTube
90s kids would remember this
Ummm that B4-4 song wasnt released in the 90's :/
8:35 he said u ain't shit n*gga 😂
Awesome Intro.
#VAPENATION!!!
9:16 Is that DJ Khaled?
Holy shit, i just realise , they are called B4-4 because they are with 3 ... 3 comes before 4 ._.
The dedication that goes into these videos, he puts his body on the line for this
Honestly Ethan, best vid you've ever done! Proud of you, Papa Bless.
it was some end of evangelion intesity
Your  tan looks more like gypsy tan
New favourite song 10/10 Papa bless.
new introoo!?
That's some real dedication to a meme.

Also, good singing voice man
8:37 Trump supporters are now big fans of you Ethan, great job, keep it up!
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THIS VIDEO!!!!!!
Skin cancer
It's like someone cloned SoFlo and made a boy band.
he just likes tanning
We gotta get this to the top of Itunes.
fucking YIKES

Worth the wait
nice meme
H3H3 I love the 90s too. I just got some nostalgia from you folks keep it going, It gets me thinking <3 man.
Highlighter with down syndrome
Your channel has exploded
Jon sorta already looks like a pop singer, I won't lie, hahaha.
Wow, you guys went all out for this video!!
4:00 did this woman just put a raisin up her nostril?

wtf
4:20 when ethan thought he was being sprayed down by tanning bronzer, he was really getting gased by the nazis.
When H3H3 earns subs for saving the Critkal BOOTY.
Edward Snowden helps Ethan create a 90's inspired track
Man, this got dark quick. If you know what I mean...
Papa Bless
no im ethan bradberry
An Exceedingly rare spot of the homogeneous khalidius can be found at 9:15 and right under a seasoned hunters nose how did he not spot this????
Holy fuck guys, DJ Khaled at 9:18
DUDE YOU'RE A LEGEND
wow
I feel like people subscribe to dislike
What  have we done
"Bronze is third place dude, you ain't shit" xD
Has Youtube gone too far?
YOU SHOULD FUCK WITH CASEY NESTAT SINCE YOU IN NYC
please put this on itunes lmao
"You've gone too far" - Maker of Vomit Cake.
A little too convincing there, Ethan.
"I was born in the wrong generation."
5:05 The "front of the shop; Ethan emerging" shot is becoming iconic.
#bringbackthe90s
This isn't the 90s' I remembered.
hila how does it feel that your husband has bigger tits than you
This is truly the best episode of H3H3. They are doing some Leonardo DiCaprio level performances here.
It's videos like these that make me believe the internet isn't a scary place
Your mother must be proud, just like Michelle :)
"you look like a highlighter with down-syndrome"

-Filthy Frank 2016
why do you do this to yourself man?
YOU ARE MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE YOUTUBE CHANNEL, PLEASE CONTINUE TO MAKE GREAT MATERIAL!!!
That moment when frank says youve gone too far.
These videos are becoming really hard to watch. I wish Ethan would just go back to what he used to do and just watch the video and commet on it.
we're in the bronze age of YouTube
I'm guessing by the people walking past you, this kind of shit goes down on a regular basis, and they're kinda like: "Oh, well ok".
this guy needs some trophies or something
"frosted tipped gentleman"
YA FACKIN PC BITCH
Damn, Ethan fam, I didn't think you'd be scraping Swain's old videos for content
Guess reaction vids cross over the same shit.
I miss Swain fuck cracked.
New Opening music? xD
Ko jos jede pasulj i gleda Etana?
"VR"
dude that's a viewfinder bro pls
i lost it at 2:19
soflo all day!!
I thought he would be black face by the end
Sick beats dude
Never go full 90s....
The fucking rings in the song. I keep thinking somebody's ringing my doorbell.
lol
anything4views
Where has this guy been all my life
The crazy part is that this song is from 2003 lol
That song was released in 2000 though...
Soon that will be me ! even though i wasn't born in the 90's thats all I've ever wanted in life is too look that awesome
any NOFX fans?
aesthetic
2:18-2:24 Best dancing i've ever seen by far

Ethan became Patrice Wilson
Awww shiiit YTV!!! CANADA STAND UP!! Yeah!....yeah.... no one does. :'(
Only 90's kids
Jizz... cuzi!
you can't stop me from bronzing dude (spffft) why don't you write a Tumblr post about YOU FUCKING PC BIATCH! . . . . that part had me in stitches
You have become a self-absorbed monster and should seek help immediately.
Remember the 90s?
Wow, Ethan, great boobs, proud of you!
Best youtuber
it look like a deep web gideo
hi
This isn't about you right now, I'm just dancing... LOL
I shouldn't watch this while eating
i was born in 1999 THE 90's WERE MY CHILDHOOD
I didn't know Donald trump was in a boy band when he was younger.
Now thats dedication
Hila must really love you 
If I was her, I would have left you immediately
The collaboration of JonTron, H3H3 and Filthy Frank might just be the best thing that's happend to the internet since the Fappening.
This is the pinnacle of human achievement. Nothing will ever beat this.
I think this is probably one of your best videos. I fuckin died with "I'm goin to make you jizz....cuzzi with me tongiht." Holy shit Bruh. I'm fuckin dead!!!
Bunch n roll + Chub and tuck combo killed it.
"Go to the beach and frost your tips
Stay in the sun 'til it looks like you have jaundice"

Shit is beautiful. :')
THIS IS BLACKFACE! YOU'VE TAKEN IT TOO FAR
When you commit to a joke you commit man
repersent the nation dude
I'm searching for that one comment that genuinely tries to make out this is blackface and racist hahah
5:00 he looks like a fucking Mexican
Anyone else thing one of them look uncannily like Ethan?
WHY DON'T YOU WRITE A TUMBLR POST ABOUT IT YOU FUCKING PC BITCH!
I literally Cringed the whole 13:32 of this Video , god damnit ethan
Holy shit! Wow Ethan Great job! That was just really really god damn good. You should do a video about you taking all your previous learnings of Puka shell necklaces kissing pranks and bracelets and convert yourself into a super sayian swag lord and just pull bitches in an epic HOW TO PICK UP WOMEN WITH ETHAN KLEIN(Kissing pranks gone sexually wrong in the hood). I could even see an amazing Club scene with one fucked up doctor and a few other memes wandering about. Maybe film it at a youtube meetup after party?
.yes.
Lucky he lives in New York. Imagine doing this shit on the street in a small town
Ethan I know it's supposed to be funny.

But you need to lose some weight you are on the cusp of obesity before it's too late to fucking turn back do everyone who gives a shit about you a favor and spend about 5 months eating broccoli and chicken breast.

Also your hat is stupid.
the new fashion icon donald trump X Ethan klein
"im gonna make you jizz tonight"-h3h3 2016
h3h3 has taken youtube to the next level, its actually exciting when they upload a video and this was fucking absolutely brillant,ethan your a god, pappa bless.
Amazing

This is beautiful art!
Ethan actually looked like DJ Khaled when he looked in the mirror
ethan, you look like someones dad who makes too many dad jokes,great moves, keep it up, proud of you.
As FilthyFrank might say, it's time to stop!
The fucking producer. Holy shit that scene was great.
holy shit he's so sweaty at 3:30 kek
Wtf did I just watch
Still no reply from h3h3
coughing after too much vaping
one of your funniest videos
Why is it that I only like Frank when he's in the world of h3h3?...

It's irrational, but I'm sure there's an explaination leaning on the rational side.
Vapenation
Appreciate the production quality, bit low on the gafs
I subbed because you helped out Cr1tikal
why is the video taken down
Thank you for helping Critikal
This is so funny, Great job

I feel like Ethan might be having a mental breakdown.
VAPE NATION IN THE 90's !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A terrifying masterpiece
This Is Way To Etchy Even For A Meme Lord.

HOLY FUCK THOSE WERE SOME VIOLENT MOVES 2:17 FUCK ETHAN I CAME  ON MY DOG FUCK
I like to believe that in an alternate universe , Frank and Jon said yes
There is nothing in the world that sums up the 90s better than this video...
12:47 done.
You know you've gone too far when Frank says "you've gone too far"
I fucking died when i noticed he was actually doing a spray tan.
I hoped frank would say yes

Thanks for cheering me up during hard times Ethan, keep up the great work
Masturbating can be boring unless you get creative and figure out at least five best ways to masturbate. Just like sex, sometimes you have to mix it up a bit. OK, so masturbation is not just like sex, but it is necessary. There's no need to spend money on fake vaginas or vibrating tools to get a good go at it. Use these household items to give yourself a great orgasm.

1. Pillow. Find a pillow you don't like, or that someone you don't like uses to sleep on. Pillows are one of the best ways to masturbate but make sure it is cotton filled, down filled will prick your prick. Now go at it missionary style. The elevation and plushness of the pillow with the hard mattress underneath will help you get off. Try the floor for firmer support. You may also want to try a full body pillow for something to grab on to. 
2. Baggie. Not the kind of baggie you get in the alley behind the bar; a sandwich baggie like the one your mommy used to put your PBJs in. Fill up the baggie with lube, Vaseline works for this best way to masturbate. Put your member inside and squish it around until you're all nice and gooey. Put the baggie, with you in it, between the mattress and box spring. Happy pumping! 
3. Handgina. Most of the best ways to masturbate include using items that will be tight and provide pressure. Lay sideways on the bed and grab it like a rabbit with your knuckles facing the wall. Turn face down pushing your knuckles into the mattress and get to it. Make sure you push your knuckles hard into the bed to get the full effect. 
4. Fruitgasmic. After this you'll look at the grocery store fruit isle in a different way. You may be walking down the produce isle thinking about the best ways to masturbate. Cut a room temperature kiwi fruit and cut it in half. Spoon out and eat the middle on each side but leave 1/4-inch around the sides. Cut off the rounded end on each half. Slip both kiwi rings over your pee-pee and move up and down.
2:20 you're welcome
at least hasn't killed himself he's alive ! fuck
No one likes you
Literally OH MY GOD YES
For someone that makes youtube vids and shit Jon is pretty awkward when on cam.
WHY YOU DO THIS D:
Is Ethan ruining his life with this?
Sick as fuck bro.
I love you even more now for helping cr1tikal
So much work for this vid
Holy crap... What is... that?

9:18 We see a Homogenous Khalidius in the wild.
what a fatass go to the gym
I did something similar when I watched Firestarter by The Prodigy. I got myself an American flag jumper, I shaved my head to look like a thinning devil, I put on a ton of piercing and eyeliner and went into an abandoned tunnel. At the end I felt like jackass taking it too far as well.
"You look like an Israeli carrot"
11:48 I need that full song, in fact, we all do.
im so glad to be alive in this era.
looking like Ethan Bradbury, recently heard he joined a boy band, let me know if the rumors are true ;*
You know what i hate... Those people who says "Only 90s kids understand''

Only 2000s kids knows what im talking about ;)
It was acceptable in the 90s
This was fucking incredible
\//\ Vapenation \//\

One of the singers looks like Soflo.
I don't know how they kept a straight face throughout this.
0:23. SOFLOantonio
This time I didn´t laugh my ass off, I laughed my asshole out
Annnnd this is the video that officially killed ethan in 20 years.
He went full Tim and Eric on this one
With that tan ethan looks like a lightskin
Why did they choose a young boy for the video? 
I mean, I'm sure they must have noticed the pedophile angle.
HI MY NAME IS ETHAN BRADBERRY!
No iTunes link?
This turns me on
Too bad you're a fucking moron, your videos would be good otherwise.

This video is a fucking masterpiece!
Like if you agree.
Not gonna lie, that haircut looks pretty good on him.
congratulations.....  you just played yourself
I spent the first part of the video thinking it'd be funny if you rocked the 90s look and I spent the rest feeling sorry for Hila
This song was released in the year 2000
the triat is complete. the gods have joined together
AYY!! That music video was a clip from YTV. O Canada
this is the reason i'm alive
You saved Cr1TiKaL! :D

For a moment I really thought I was going to get to see Jon Tron with frosted tips :/ gutted.
6:02 puppy eyes lmaooo
Great moves keep it up proud of you!
Your song is honestly not that bad, I'd purchase
Ethan looks like he cosplayed Keemstar
Ethan has officially transcended memes. How is such a meme level possible??
4:20 that scar on his back though
Tim and Eric still doing their act?
Swag level " over 9000"
Dude, you went full retard..... i dont even know if this is a joke or not. i felt ill just watching you and  thinking about how ill you must have felt
Making yourself look like a heroin addict from 90's just to make a comedy video? That's dedication. God bless you
Anyone else think when they saw the title he meant Ethan bradberry?
Make this video 5 seconds longer
Hi Anything for views! Hows it going

After this Ethan suffered severe Acne

Get down isnt even from the 90's, its 2003
WTF

His frosted tips stopped me from cutting.
well done. Hilarious dialogue...
I wasn't  triggered by your blackface






If anything it made me wet.  
Wanna mate?
would be good to have hot music to it
"You ain't shit nigga!" Lmao wtf
That kid didn't find VR goggles in that garbage can, he found a View-Master. And the greatness that is the 90's of course.
The effort is crazy , round of applause 4 you man
i dont like this guy, he thinks he is funny. but he isnt.. and he has a face you realy want to punsh doesnt he?
"When the Cringe is too strong"
You sound pretty close to young thug, just needed more auto tune
wild
less of this bullshit more vape naysh
Why do these niggas look like so flo clones lmao
5:10 fucking killed me.
No youtuber makes me laugh soo much for sure. 👌 love ya, appreciate ya <3
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Kids these days. They don't know.
got 'em. got 'em good.
the song is not even from the '90s...
Boy band guys = Extremely douchey feminized douchebags who sing like little girls..
So fuckin awesome. Wish I had Ethan's personality..
i think thats the first time papa franku's been called PC
Bronze means 3rd place you aint shit nigga
This is classic H3
Thank you for embarrassing yourself for this quality content.
Holy shit, I own those exact shorts! From H&M lol
I'm only 3 years old and I hate my generation, I wish more people from my generation would appreciate this video.
HES A BLACK GUY... PLAYING A WHITE GUY.... WHOS PRETENDING TO BE A BLACK ACTOR PLAYING A BLACK GUY
Is bronze face a new thing
At first I thought it was Ethan Bradberry joining a boy band.
We had to wait a bit, but it was so worth it.
never thought i would hear the words "went too far" out of filthy fucking frank
I'm gonna make you jizz tonight!!!
So cringey
what's the name of the tune at 5:55 sounds really familiar.
Ethan looks like a young Justin Timberlake if he was shit out by one of the douchebags from Jersey Shore hahaha omfg.
That shit only charted here in Canada at number 4 nonetheless, how the fuck did you find this?
don't tell me it's on itunes
WOW He went above and beyond for this video. You don't see other youtubers doing that.
ethan has balls haha
I came
Dude big thanks for helping cr1tikal
Loving the giant sweat stains too
"I'm gonna make you... Come over tonight. And then I'm gonna make you come." - Ethan 2016
OVER TO MY HOUSE
5:05 fucking jews man
11:25 omg
I love Ethan's walk, it looks like he's turtling.
Ethan I HONESTLY think you should consider keeping that look cuz that hair+tan+pimp ass earring combo just works perfectly for you! You have created yet another meme! Keep it up! Proudaya!
I feel so awkward for schmoyoho
I hope that's not permanent
i'm gonna make you jizzcuzi with me tonight
I thought I know all the boybands from the 90s. But this one looks like a really crappy band..... wait they're all crappy. The members weren't even good looking!
I think he got the bronze right at the end there.
A big moist thank you for helping cr1tikal
now THATS conviction!
Ethan can I buy your frosted curly tips if ya still got em?
You dont miss the 90s you miss New Jersey
you know its pritty fucking funny when filthy frank is struggling not to laugh
The guy with bleached hair looks like soflo...
Thanks for helping Critikal Ethan
Ethan make sure that spray tan is vegan & cruelty-free. You don't know you might be spraying the blood of Palestinian children on your face.
i need new underwear man you made me jizz
\//\
anyone else notice the good ol' bunch 'n' roll? Lol
What I'm still trying to understand is how those guys in that band can look both "fit and chubby" at the same exact time.  Is it the bronzer in their cheek area?  I'm feeling it's the bronzer in their cheek area...
Anyone else read the title as "Elton Jons a 90s Boy Band"?
Year 2356: Student opens history textbook and notices there nothing in it from 1989-2000.

"Teacher, how come theres 10 years missing in the textbook?"

Teacher stares up as a tear drops: "Because... Only 90s kids remember the 90s..."
Wow Ethan, this video made me jizzcuzzi.
hot.
9:33 Morpheus from Matrix?
ethan, you're like a creepy uncle who looks pretty young.
Get that ethan a cheeseburger! I can see his ribs! I can tell hila is pressuring ethan into a starvation for that "skinny" look.
They leaked the skypes
I am only 12 years old and I was born in the wrong generation, I'M A SPIRITUAL LYRICAL MIRACLE INDIVIDUAL!
check out my mixtape on my soundcloud.
man Ethan walking around the streets dressed like that.. 
respect.
h3h3 has gone full Tim and Eric
Ethan gotta give a massive thank you to you for getting my main man Critikal back up and making videos again. Once again proves why you're the best around
He looks like what they look like now.
You sure went all out in this one, Ethan. I appreciate that. When Filthyfrank becomes disturbed, you know you hit gold!
You look like a slippery gypsy
The song was actually released in 2000.
So this was Ethans transformation into EgoRaptor?
if you miss the 90s so much go back to dial up.
ethan is so hot, ill come to your house any time
This is so fucking perfect.
You really didn't need to do this XD!!!
my fucking goddddd. dedication to the cause Ethan. triumph.
Bronze 4 life
He puts so much effort into these videos that's why he's the best
I was born in 1999. #90skid
one thing i didn't about your look Ethan is your kept the beard!!! wtf d00d the smooth face is crucial to the look d00000000000000d.
Should've gotten Guy Fieri. I bet he'd be up for that shit, Ethan.
H3h3 is one of the only channel left that is not cancerous, with a style that reminds me of Oldschool Youtube #makeyoutubegreatagain
This is one of the best videos I've seen from Ethan xD He takes it so perfectly far
dude the dedication is insane...
papa bless, sir Ethan of the 90'z
Best way to get skin cancer.
1:24 Ethan Bradberry?
Who is the black woman at the start who says "great job"
Frank: You're taking it too far! Proceeds to eat cake made out of his best friend's pubic hair
this is why ehthan hasnt uploaded on this channel for so long... worth it!
Those faces make me cringe..
Damn, your videos are just amazing now.  GG on evolving on content.
Found this channel less than a week ago, already my favourite channel, and I have watched pretty much all of your videos 😂😂 V /\
Nice to see Frank again :-D
We are witnessing the evolution of ethan, soon he will reach his final bronzed form and will tear the world asunder. God have mercy on all of us.
All your videos are good but this was the funniest. I almost spit my Pbutter&Jelly out.
I'm gonna make you jizz ... -cuzi with me tonight! :'D
I had a dream last night where Ethan and Hila invited me over to meet them in America, and they showed me round their full on like, warehouse office buildings, and around their town, and we had a party :L My life will never be that good, put me back to sleep please.
The song was released in 2000 according to Wikipedia
\//\ vape nation
I'm gonna make you jizz-cuzzi tonight. Best line ever, hands down.
He just looks like a dirty mexican
I was conceived in the 90's... That's the best I can say regarding my 90's experience
This was uncomfortable to watch at first
I feel so bad for Hila.
the shit you do for your fans
This truly showed Ethan's descent into the dark depths of the midlife crisis. Absolutely brilliant work as always, Papa.
<3 papa franku <3
That was total rubbish.
I would.
NICE MOVES
but i dont want to come toe your house.

"too bad, im going to MAKE you come!"

ahhhh rape culture
Ethan the kind of guy who looks like Patrice Wilson
This whole video is just a joke going too far. Like to the moon far. Still funny though XD
h3h3 best youtuber <3

in my head the filthy Frank 'its time to stop' meme kept playing throughout the video
8:00 it was just a tan bro
DJ KHALED AT 9:17!
God when Papa Frank is telling you to get your shit together you know you gone goofed. Great Video!
The real cringe is Ethan dancing while his buttcrack is showing
Thanks for saving Cr1tikal, Ethan :D
Ouch why so many dislikes?
I really needed my h3h3 hit today
This video is xtrme
Never go full retard...
this is gold
I lost my shit when I saw filthy frank :DDD

9:16 Ethan looks like a gypsy from Romania.
Wtf am i watching !!!!
Bronze Nation!
2:18 i fucking died great moves Ethan keep it up and that fupa is godlike ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Playing so much MGSV recently I kinda wanted to see Ethan punch the mirror at the end
I laughed my ass off big time because of the end of your song

Lyrics plox !
I can not contain myself while that song is playing
a LIKE isn't good enough for this video lol
Ethan really took it far this time.
I love it.

2:18 wow ethan, great moves
IT'S JUST A TAN BRO

Who is the dude at 07:00?
2:19 was fucking sexy

Dammit, Jon! 
Arin would have done it.
the dudes from the boyband look like vampires that feed on unsuspecting groupies, backstage.
That tanning woman just didn't give a fuck.
bronze ass frosty tipped looking ass bitch
Ethan seriously has no fucking shame.




Proud of you.
"I'm a 90's kid" - Born 1999
The next day ethan had skin cancer.
2:12 best part
masterpiece again.
that VR is breathtaking
Where can i download this song?
papa bless
says to his wife "No ones getting down on me, thats for sure" XD
following comment not relevant to this video:

i just wanted to stop by and say that what I think you did for Cr1tikal concerning his BS strikes was super cool.  We need more of that in the Youtube community.  Viewers and creators alike need to have eachother's backs until Youtube gets their shit together with their system. I don't know if you have a personal connection with Cr1tikal or if you just took the initiative, either way, keep it up!
quality cancer Cunt
Ethan, you weren't even alive in the 90s
i love the tan! took me right back to the 90's
this video was a life experience!
Ethans ass Is smart its loyal I respect that
i miss ur old reactions, watching a video and reacting. before you hit 1M, i miss ur old vids man
loved it
dj khaled at 9:18
idk why i read the title as elton john a 90s boy band @_@
hhaahahha awesome video
Ethan's singing voice sounds like a squeakier Bob Dylan.
The only bronze thing I got are my pants. 
Get it?
...'cause I shat them at 2:12
What the fuck was they weird ass shit. I love it
That was genuinely brilliant.
You look like the owner of a 7/11 chain.
I'm going to make Ethan come tonight






Over to my house
I cant decide whether this is cringe or pure genius!!!✌🏾👍🏾👌🏽
They were fucking hideous I hope your being sarcastic they were orange as fuck
the funniest part of the video is at 3:46 where the infamous cough is capture while he waits. i cant explain why thats funny but its sheer genius on h3h3' part. 

keep it up guys! 

cooh
"I can't stop bronzing, dude!" - 90% of the LoL-player base
Filthy Frank and the other guy kept cracking up. It's hard to keep a straight face around Ethan. xD
Guido face
Best video you have ever made gg
Damn, I wanted to see Ethan, FilthyFrank and JonTron in a boy band together!
can you upload the song by itself plz
Schmoyo looks like Edward Snowden
Did the tanning lady pick her nose?
You're fucking crazy, Ethan. I love you <3
Tabs plz
You went too far, it got cringe.
\//\
@5:17
YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO KNOW HOW THAT WOMAN IS FEELING! DON'T YOU KNOW WOMEN GET RAPED ON THE STREETS LIKE EVERY MINUTE?! SHE WAS PROBABLY TERRIFIED YOU WERE GOING TO RAPE HER! CAT-CALLING NEEDS TO STOP! YOU'RE PERPETUATING RAPE CULTURE, YOU MISOGYNISTIC PIG!
Ethan, you're the only person I could watch do... this.
Great vid.
Ethan and Hila!  You guys are already in B4-4's Wikipedia entry: "In 2016, they were featured in an h3h3 Productions YouTube video containing the music video of their song titled "Get Down"."  hahaha
Next time I see someone crazy ass looking on the street, I'll think to myself 'hey, maybe they're just making a YouTube video'
uncle ethan knows it all
Just pure genius as always!
All of these New York YouTubers, might as well add in MKBHD and Casey. Hahahaha.
HOLY SHIT
standing ovation from the toilet
Ethan you should of just gone with a broccoli cut. It's so versitle.
Ethan what do you squat dude? I ain't gay but I want to smack the shit outta that ass. 







Ehhh maybe I'm a little gay.
Ethan back at it again with the broccoli cut.
Ahhhhhhhhhahahaha
im crying with my dick
I laughed so much I tasted blood!
What a time to be alive.
Holy shit
What have you done?
When he said one more friend who was even more desperate i knew it has to be b0ss
crap...... the song is stuck in my head
Now Ethan should join a 80s hair band.
Fuck sake...XD
all the cool kids just had to dislike the video
Who else kind of thinks he looks good because of the hair
Strange, the song reminds me of Gorillaz
my only goal in life is to look like a member of b4-4
Ethan, you are an artist.
3:17 is he sick of being meme? Oh nooooooooooooooooo....
Best video of all time.
GTFO of my recommendation list
Hello evrY ONE!!! Please go and veiw my whole channle, I do REC, Gaming, commentarry! Plez ENJOY

Ethan becomes a new meme every episode of h3h3
B4-4 looked so cracked out
Brilliant.
I hope H3H3 reviews more Canadian treasures.
I'm gonna make you jizz-cuzzi. Damn Ethan some deep lyrics
No one beats this guy on youtube. Papas special frosted tip bless from all of your fans
FUCK, I LOVE THIS ONE.
Remember when H3 was just that random guy who appeared in Snipar's videos?
Should have gotten a tribal tattoo.

You look like a highlight of down syndrome - rekt
Dear Ethan and Hila,

Please become friends with Idubbbztv to add to the amazing h3h3-Filthy Frank-Jontron relationship. It would literally be the greatest thing on the internet.
xd
damn papa is back
when filthyfrank is the voice of reason you know you're fucked
That was fucking amazing! I really like your new, more creative style! I bet this was even more fun to shoot than the reaction videos, wasn't it? But, anyhow, Ethan, great moves, keep it up, proud of you.
It's just a tan bro!!!
Lets be honest Ethan went too far, take it from Filthy Frank he knows when "it's time to stop."







you can slap me for that one.
I love it, I want to join your boyband but Dj khaled, Ethan Bradberry and One fucked up Dentist are probably more qualified than me.
Ethan looks like a character from gta
Was the black kid in the video, the same one from Role Models the movie?
You know its stupid when FilthyFrank says its too stupid
This is a nice spray tan addiction documentary.
I feel like this is too far even for Ethan
Timmy B's got some fukin competition boiisss
Oh my god ethan, you are the God of YouTube.
i heard u guys were working on a vid but GOOOOOOOOD DAMMMMMN this was something else. Great moves, keep it up, proud of u
this is art
Ethan you are are one crazy bastard.
That shit was ripe boy
the source vid is gone!!!!
got orgasm while watching this.
Ethan! Great moves for helpin out Cr1t!!!

Ethan doesn't give a single fuck holy hell
2:18 EW! WTF! xD
Hey man you're absolutely ripped!!!
He's a funny guy!
Nice vid pewds
OR ABOUT THE 80'S I WANNA BE THERE BOO
I have never sexually identified with a video before, until now.
I didn't think you would be able to top Vape Nation. But you definitely did.
do you really know how to tan?
you should have used the oven
such fuckery much troll
shave your beard
shave your bears
that's hot
does evan want to look like 90s boys band or is everthing a joke?
Damn, Ethan......you looking fiiiiiiinnnneeeee!
"a quarter to one" had me dying.  i thinks its around 9:08
holy shit this is wild
Is it cause i'm high? Or is this one of the funniest fucking videos they've made? and fucking Papa Franku!!
Just remember.... It's pepper time
Can someone make a relation chart with h3, idubbbz, jontron, and all those other gay retards?
I can't be the only one that thought Ethan sounded like Phil Collins when he was singing.
You did it again <3
I...didn't expect this.
You look like hillary clintons retarded lesbian sister
gr8 vid, to cringe to watch
Wow Erhan, keep 90's alive!
I'm not even sure what to think of this
Ethan , can u talk about TaTu . i mean i need ur reaction on All the things she said heuheueheue
lolololololololololol damn ethan back at it again makin me laff
Song's pretty catchy tbh.
This is the best.
"why dont you write a tumblr post about it you pc bitch"
you know who hes talking about.
Can't believe he did that to his hair hahahahaha
90s were dope. Just not as dope as the 80s. Ethan, you didn't go back far enough.
you're a retarded genius . I know it doesn't make sense but neither do you XD
seriously ethan, are you out of your damn mind... black face? doood
Eviva l'arte I guess.
I'm here to defend the 90s and AMERICA! For one these fuckers are a Canadian boy band and never really popular in the US. For two they formed in 99 but any of their hits didn't come out until the 2000s.. The 90's were way to awesome to ever have some child molesting, bronzed, fully grown men prancing around.. So let's get this straight this is from the stupid fucking 2000s..
b3b3 productions
2:18 where's my gif?
THE 90'S
Ermagerd JonTron
A sad and pedophilic story. Papa bless, \//\.
That last 'ay' hahahahahhaha
Ey ey ey ey ey eyeyeyeyeyeheheheheheheyeyeyeyeye
                          Eyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyeyyyeye

That part made me laugh so hard xD
I loe how Frank is struggling so hard not to laugh, lol.
Ethan's the quality cringe maker on YouTube hands down. How does he do it? How does he not give a single fuck about society? :D I admire him...
0:17. the guy sitting on the floor with camo pants looks like ethan bradbarry to me
I wont lie this song is kinda funky
Everything 4 yt money
I laughed through the entirety of this video. Keep it up, proud of you.
This is crazy... rofl
3 spoopy 5 me
There's a reason why we from the 90's don't miss the 90's and i just remembered why :/
WTF man? This is getting weirder and weirder
Godammit
DUDE! At 4:00 she was picking her nose lmao FTW DUDE!
Cause I know all ya'll wanna listen to this on repeat @ 2:13  !!! 8:54
So, just to be clear, 3 of the same guy want to 69 with a young black boy and make him come

@5:15 I legit thought that you looked like a stereotypical italian. Holy cow.
Instagram warned me but why did i still watch this, nightmares are real

09:00, shit man, were u actually dying?
You're actually insane
This video made me feel something I have never felt before. I honestly have no idea what this feeling is.
Does anyone else think the one in the white shirt Looks like soflo lmfao
My asshole is from the 90s and it knows what Ethan is talking about
The broccoli is starting to get out of control ethan

I'd get down on you Ethan :]

V/\
"The Nineties."

Kurt Cobain's ghost is weeping.
I'm so glad the coughs are back. but he really should have shaved himself for that bit.. but overall, fucking amazing
Had a rough start for the day until I watched this, thanks for making my day, that was so awesome
uncle muscles
My boy Ethan, when are you going to make more reaction videos so I can be 'inspired' by your content and steal your jokes?

EDIT: Ethan, that shirt that you're wearing reminds of one of your best videos, "Don't mess with Tommy".
little did ethan knew, he was sprayed with zyklon-b
that shit goes hard etan🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
Worth the wait.
Ethan, youtube is a stressful career path and your galdolf the gray hair shows it :/ let me relieve your stress bb

Sounds like he is saying make him cum tonight??
the next video will start with jon and  otherguyidontknow having an intervention with ethan becauseof his chronic broncing.
an alternate of the "Don't Mess With Tommy" outfit
Over 1000 *people downvoted this.

Just let that sink in for a minute.
Where did Ethan get that scar on his back? Didn't he get stabbed, or am I mixing him up with Tim Heidecker?
If you look carefully at 03:45 you can clearly see all the fucks in the world migrate to back to the 90s. Great video, proud of you, keep it up. Sincerely Ethan Bradbury.
Was Frank's reaction staged or was that his actual initial reaction to seeing you caked in fake tan?
Get rekt 90's ver
one of them looks like SoFlo.
The song needs to be No.1 on Napster
Wow! That was actually a bit like generation split drama. Deep shit, man.

That chub was so tucked!
Never go full retard
I absolutely applaud your dedication. You are too good to us. Papa Bless.

Anybody know where I can find the video of Michelle Obama from the intro
#lewronggeneration
Hey Hila, So how many takes did you have to do between 11:05 - 11:35 before you could do the entire thing without laughing.
I literally hate you tubers like h3 who upload once a month
dat ching chong said the n-word. thats racial.
Dude that was funny but the bronzing also made me feel like a child watching Mr Flobby again, I can't even describe the discomfort that I'm feeling, please don't ever do that again
2:54 definitely make "him" cum
woops freudian slip
This shits sad
This is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.

This is the cringiest shit I've ever seen.
Ethan is so desperate to get noticed by Dj Khaled
Hmmm. Ok you got this one out the way. Normal h3h3 reaction video next time? People in comments seem to think it was exceptional, so what do I know?
Loved Vape Ethan, Now we get Boyband Ethan. I need action figures!
Goddamn, this comradery between Ethan, Papa Franku, Jontron, iDubbz and Maxmoefoe is the best fucking thing in the world... :D
8:40 No he didn't say that, no he didn't! Omg
It's COWBOY TANAKA!
9:18 DJ Khalid cameo???

Skin cancer inbound
Puff up, poodle out, frost it down
oy vey
#bronzelivesmatter
I was born in the 80s, grew up in the 90s. I remember a lot of crappy boybands but I've never heard this song before. Papa must have blessed me.
8:38 He was like "you ain't shit nigga"
double layer wife beaters gain like 1000 swag points
T H I C C 😩 💦
I agree with Frank. This is too far.
The title reminds me of Always Sunny episodes
this is cyber rape
The fucking commitment.. Appreciate ya
"BRONZE MEANS 3RD PLACE YA AIN'T SHIT NIGGA"
Almost sounds like David Bowtie! Keep it up Ethan!
90s had Columbine js
what's up with cr1tikal an how did Ethan help, just curious, dont know the situation at all
You've had a good run.  Shame.
Swain exposed B4-4 years ago on Cracked TV
thank you Ethan for aiding cr1tical against the YouTube bullshit. you both rock.
Ethan, your my hero lmfao
ethan sounds like young thug in his song
i love how ethan embraces that he's a new yorker and he knows that no one will give a shit what he looks like
Ethan doesn't give a fuck anymore...
When even Franku sed thats too much

not really,
Amazing
why?
How anyone could think a guy playing a video game and making fun of kids while calling them Hitler and making cancer jokes is funnier and smarter humor than this absolutely baffles me.
aw yea schmoyoho
Omg what a mess you looked like when
You walked out with that robe and wine
Another Canadian gem
still a faggot
10/10
Was expecting a "IT'S TIME TO STOP!" From papa Franku
I have just came for your support for penguinz0, dude you just made YouTube great again!
Schmoyoho!!
yo dude thanks for helping Cr1tikal get those strikes gone :)
You killed this look way too much. It's not even satire anymore you fucking goddess
Ethan you look like a retarted version of The Jersey Shore cast and young Justin Timberlake





but i can respect that
b44 are from the 2000's please sort your facts out
you know you are way too missed up when filthy frank tells you to get your shit together
vape natioooon
The production values off the charts in this
man Ethan the jew fro is kinda getting out of control.
Jesus Christ this was goddamn awful, and I love you for it.
So this is what Northernlion is always saying is his favorite song.
That moment when ethans song just sounds like any chart song now
i miss the 90s too, we had great shows like icarly and artists such as skrillex and nickelback
I think Ethan was BORN IN THE WRONG GENERATION!!!!
I dunno if it's just me being anal, but this song was released in 2000
Why are there 1000 dislikes
a  e  s  t  h  e  t  i  c
he needs to be more active with uploading
Ethan just doesn't give a fuck does he
Yes ! You guys are the best ^_^
Ethan is a true method memer.
Eathan + SoFlo Antonio +  Patrice = Best boys Band ever!
Papa bless!
Reminds me of darudes sandstorm
LOL this video was awesome.
ethan, frank's right unlike you he has some limits dude.

ethan u ok

THIS WAS AMAZING. I don't care how long I wait for vids if they're as good as this! love u guys!!!!
Jesus Christ
I thought the VapeNation thing was already too far
shit man that was a fucking journey dude
The music video is nowhere to be found on YouTube, where can I see this gem?
B4-4 received a Juno Award nomination in 2001 for Best New Group, but lost to Nickelback. Now that's comedy gold.
fantastic
Ethan, I don't think an older joke has ever been told. This video is about to resurrect a meme I wish never existed in the first place. May God (and Papa) have mercy on our souls.
hahahhahahahahahhahahahaha  went abit mental there ethan!!! funny tho!!
Dude. Easily one of your best videos yet. 10/10
4:22 where did you get that sick scar, dude?
That binocular kid from the 90s music video must be Patrice Wilson. That would explain a lot.
I thought this was about ETHANBRADBERRY!:(
can I buy this on the iTunes ???
Hey Ethan great video man. :-)
You should do a video on the legendary Youtube channel TOYS in Japan.
They make high quality nursery rhymes and with ground breaking effects featuring everybody's favourite characters such as Shrek, Pink Hulk, Minions and Peppa Pig.
Some of my favourite and most visually stunning videos include Five Nights at Freddy's To The Toilet And Farts, Five Little African Children Jumping On The Bed,  Jingle Bells Batman - Wild Dance and, my personal favourite, Hitler Sings Karaoke Finger Family.
Of course I couldn't mention all of TOYS in Japan's amazing videos but you should defiantly check their channel out.
Damn, at least warn us before you bust out that sweet ass, Ethan. Now I have to change my pants.
So you have become Patrice WIlson? Making songs, fiddling kids.
best video yet
At the 04:26 Ethan looks like he's in a concentration camp
What Juxtaposition.
This is ridiculous. It is respect worthy, but that's all.
6:05 That tape must've hurt like sin to take off lmaooo
Bronze nashe
i tought donald trump was the last one of his race.
Wow I can see why there haven't been a lot of h3h3's lately. You really put a lot of effort into this one and it paid off, my girlfriend and I were in tears.
If filthy frank tells you to get your shit together, you know you're broken beyond repair
#MemorableMeMeoftheyear
I have not laughed this hard in awhile. this guy is great.
Tan Nation! T\/
push it H3. push it as far as you like.
You're a brave manchild Ethan
I respect you almost as much as my own father who himself was a boy trapped in the body of an adult
that young boy eventually grew up to become Patrice Wilson.
made me laugh thank you
Thank you for keeping Cr1tikal alive on YouTube! Papa Bless.
ISRAELI CARROT.
Ethan i love you
Wtf this is just ............fucking savage gold 😂😂😂😂
holy sheet Ethan, always finding a way to out-edge yourself. I respect that, keep it up.
cant believe ethan did this. pls

The intensity of that dance session was incredible, I couldn't stop laughing :)
Your hard work is impressive and inspiring, you two are the best!

2:20 Ethan looks like Steven Universe.
Fucks given: 0
Ethan "b 5, b 4"

Me "you sunk my battleship "
Giving you a like because I feel bad you went so far...
George was right dude
Is there blackface in Japan?

"You look like an Israeli carrot..." (GONE SEXUAL)
I just can't imagine Ethan on LSD. Just do it man, you'd fuck the world with that video.
Seen this shit on Vice so step the fuck up or shut the fuck up!
True form of art
This video is so weird... You can tell he began it with genuine intentions, but he kinda played along with the idea until it reached extravagant proportions.
Ephixia did a thing from this video

https://soundcloud.com/ephixa/h3h3-90s-tribute-club-mix
it's times like these I wish I had the 5 star rating back.
To bring the 90s back we to reverse shotgun holes
8:38 " you ain't shit nigger" - Sean Lmaooo ya boy is in Israel and is dropping N bombs like its 1950's lmao
all this for a joke? jeez talk about commitment to a video. also, was that jontron?
I love it when jontron and/or filthy frank appear in his videos
there wasn't a little canadian girl in the year 2000 who didn't know that b4-4 song even though we didn't understand it. this video was a nostalgic, emotional rollercoaster, thank u papa.
Bronzed Aliens
steps for frank to join 
step one: pour blench in your eyes 
step two: drink any leftover blench 
step three: send pic of your body before and after steps 1,2
You just went full Tim Heidecker. You never go full Tim Heidecker.
This is so cringeworthy lol
fucking amazing, you guys are on a streak of amazing videos, keep it up
wow, these videos have transformed. keep it up
That moment when Filthy Frank tells you to get your shit together.
G motherfucking G Ethan! Nice coughs!
You are a god.
i killed a man
I'll get down on you
Thank you for helping big cr1t aka Big Moist, you can do no wrong in my eyes Ethan, love you forreal.
epic one!
You get stabbed in the back with a fork?
Looks like Ethan's cough is back. Yay!
I can tell you guys are stepping away from reaction videos, and honestly so far it's great. Whatever you guys come up with lately has been hilarious. I just hope that shit washes off pretty quick
Great moves Ethan, keep it up. Proud of you.
LOL i think that lady doing the spray tanned was fucking annoyed dealing with ethan.  hehe
This is actual goals
Ethan, you go really far for your shit.
I respect you.
i fucking died
I look forward to the time I can look back to this moment, to this video, knowing that this is when Ethan and Hila stood together and made history. Thank you guys.
NEW VIDDDDEOO
The skype with you and Frank was fucking priceless.
You know it's fucking serious when PapaFranku himself says "You've taken it too far"
\/ /\
better story than thomas the vengaboys
I'm genuinely laughing aloud. Best H3 video ever. Papa Bless.
Your body genuinely makes me uncomfortable
"You look like an Israeli carrot."

"You know what bronze means? Bronze means 3rd place. You ain't shit."

lmao dead

lmao
Ethan love ya appreciate ya, but you should of known it was a bad idea when papa Franku said you've taken something too far... Gosh darn it.
I'm liking this out of pity
Holy... Fucking... Shit...
tfw when you are  homemade malteser with some "Kiesza-Khalifa" hairstyle.
BTW, Can we talk about DAT ASS, 10/10 will spray my face again.
Khali- I mean Khaled would be proud.
This was really hard to watch... :D
It's funny because the song was released in 2000.
This shit is crazy
although this channel doesn't post as often , when it does it's a straight banger
god of memes...

You should have shaved
where can i get the song ethan sings at the end
"YOU AINT SHIT NIGGA!" 8:37
#iwannamakeyoujizzcuzzitonight
Lost it at 2:13
this too fucking much man, i'm startin to get worried
You know you're in bad shape if FilthyFrank is telling you to get your life together.
10 years from now:

"What is up Drama Alert Nation, I'm your host, Killer Keemstar, and today, Youtube sensation h3h3Productions has tragically passed away after getting skin cancer from the 85 layers of tanning spray he used for a video. He will be sorely missed."
"Why don't you write a fucking Tumblr post about it, you PC bitch" OHHHHHHHHHHH
VAPE NATIOOOOOON
Has Ethan gone too far!? 97.1% Fail this question!
#Make2016GreatAgain

You know when Papa Frank is telling you to get your shit together you've hit rock bottom.
Ethan has the body of a middle aged woman. You're an absolute goddess, dude.
Ethan I hope this intro music isnt permanent, or ill be unsubbing soon
This made me laugh so hard I almost threw up, good shit. This made me laugh like the old h3h3 vids, no shame in your game keep it up. Also filthy frank killed it, don't know how he held it together

The lengths Ethan will go to make these videos. It's really ridiculous. Also why are people mentioning cr1tikal? Where was he in this video?
you know you're fucked up when Franku tells you it's time to stop...
For some reason, I was thinking it was Ethan Bradberry joining a 90s boy band.  It still kind of looks like it.
ART
@ 8:37 calls Ethan a nigga
"You look like an Israeli carrot".
JonTron
H3h3 is by far my favourite youtuber he literally puts so much effort into just 1 video, They always leave me dead 😂😂
"You ain't shit nigga"

Damn
Wow congratz Ethan! You really whent retard retard this time xD

Digging these jontron filthyfrank cameos

If those 3 90's gods fused together they would become Guy Ferrari
The lengths Ethan goes to review videos.
Ethan is 100% Ethan
First quality material in a long while. Nice
Memes are the only way to destroy the stupid 90s craze
Song name?
Wow!!!! I'll be you're friend but it's okay, you can check yourself.
06:30 VoyBoy? lol
Damn, you are good man B)
I actually enjoyed that song.
Spray them AIDS?
Does Ethan make a video doing something crazy with his hair whenever he wants a haircut?
Pure art.
Hi my name is anything for views
This is the best video you guys have ever made.
Xerxes Oompa-Loompas
Hila I need to know how you are able to do this with him :D
Those ethan tits tho
I must give it to him, he has the clear cut charme of a boyband frontman.
This is a bad video and i feel bad for anyone who has to watch this poop
Funny thing is the song was released in 2000 and the music video in 2003 lol.
Worth the wait. If we have to wait this long for quality content then please by all means do so. 
Papa Bless! B5-5 4 life

These 90s guys look like jersey guys from now
But but, the song is from the 00's.
Dude, your video's are some of the funniest things I've seen in a long time. Especially the last couple. You and Hila are badass.

It's awesome to see Frank and Jon trying so hard not to break character.
http://Visit2Revenue.com/?ref=33460
5:30 what is that background song?
Ethan has the clean cut charm of a 90's boy band frontman, with talent that takes risks and blows minds. 



I was born in the wrong generation.
Ethan Ethan, stay true to you! Don't let the 90's change you, it's just not your style.
V a p e n a t i o n
Kids in frosted tips could have eaten their africa

The lengths Ethan will go to emulate his fave boy band is amazing. I respect that
Papa saved Cr1tikal! yeees!
"You look like a highlighter with down's syndrome." Frank never fails to make me laugh
Looks likes a drumstick covered in Al's steak sauce.

And yes, I will join your 90's boy band. reflecter jacket and all.
v e r y    f u n n y. also, i like how you sing. it sounds good.
Ethan, I think you're going a little too far to make a goof.
Who's watching this for the dozenth time?
So fucking funny man keep up the good work, cracked me up couldn't stop laughing.
I'd like to politely DEMAND A FULL VERSION
Fuck! This was funny.
Virtual reality...pfft.

#VapeNation Papa ethan has a nive ass yo
Thank you for helping Cr1tikal
I've grown so used to Ethan wearing the weirdest shit, it's like seeing any other normally dressed person. It kinda concerns me.
Vape Nation V/\
HOLY, FUCKING SHIT.  itan sounds like that black singer Akon somehow xD

This is fucking IMPRESSIVE. What a champ xD
ethan looks like he just woke up to do the video
wow, you got guts doing that, I could never look that ridiculous, good work :)
o h s h i t
Holy shit frank got real on you! You ain't shit nigga bronze is 3rd place lol
This is why you shouldn't vape.
"You look like an israeli carrot" is the best line of all time
filthy frank motherfucker
This episode is better than the Natural Born Pranksters movie.
This is some amazing commitment Ethan. Papa bless.
and thats how to become Trump
the naysh will return
Pretty lame
I miss the 19 nine zeroes 😢 like if u miss it 2

"Bronze means 3rd place. you aint shit nigga"
I don't comment often, but holy shit that takes some balls.

This dude is sooo damn funny lmbo
I'm not gonna lie, I'M ETHAN BRADBURY!
Where is there to go from here

We have reached the peak of the Internet 

And the peak is negative
If this was the Olympics, you would win the bronze medal. I'm a funny guy
I'm dying.
I'm dying.
good vid  thanks for helping cr1tical btw
technically, this is a 2000s song
Your hair actually looks nice like that
Johns wearing the same shit from his warcraft rant video
He looks like a lesbian when he's with schmoyoho
The funny part is "Get Down" wasn't even 90s, it was made in 2000. A lot of cringe worthy stuff was made in the early 2000s but people think it was late 90s.
'bout time
spicy 👌
Dude  cutting your own hair, going into a studio and getting tan just for one video, that is real dedication right here.
the legitimate coughing was grade A
so a camera can record bass sound perfectly? I mean, I can hear all the bass when Ethan is in the studio.
H3H3, JonTron AND Filthy Frank in one video? My penis can only be so erect you guys. Bouss pls....
Fucking.Dedicated.
"1/4 2 1 b55" - My new favourite one man boy band.
Holy shit you went WAYYYY too far this time
AKG C414 is a great ass mic
You really dont care how you look like I respect that
H3H3 + JonTron + Filthy Frank = PURE GOLD!
I'm half way through the video and I'm fucking dying man lol
Ethan i love you so 90s
I'm a little scared that Ethan might cancer.
Ethan thank you for saving Charlie, aka Critkal!
Jesus christ.
>inb4 b4-4
I hope my grandson grows up to be just like you.
boner time
Too cringy il see u next vid
Frosted broccolli haircut
This was amazing lol Love it
This is so retarded, I'm not sure if that's an insult or a compliment but I know it's the truth.
4:02 SHE STRAIGHT DUG IN HER NOSE
9:18 DJKhaled Shaved in disguise spotted
Jizzcuzi lmao
How do you get this much confidence? I want to be able to go out in public in the most ridiculous outfits just for the goofs.
I wonder if Donald Trump uses the same bronzer as Ethan
Wow, what a bradberry
Spread dem AIDz
VAPENAAAYYSHAAAAAUN
13:21 \//\
tfw you genuinely like ethan's new look
Dang, Ethan has a great singing voice. :P
"I'm gonna make you jizz...cuzzi with me tonight" LMFAOOO IM DEAD
I think this may be the best thing you've ever done. Holy shit my throat hurts from laughing so much.
Dat ass doe.
What song is playing at 6:59 ?
You can see where that tape wrapped around his head fucking wrecked his neckbeard
This man is freakin dedicated. Two thumbs up and much respect, Ethan. Also Jontron....
"you look like a fucking idiot", and thats coming from a failed kamikaze pilot, ethan youre under the rubbish
With those socks! ya.... you can get down on me!
Wow. Ethan. Great chub and tuck. Proud of you
Anything for views
Keep the videos cummin'. Love you
Jesus Christ, this is outstanding.
Did frank say nigger
IT'S TIME TO STOP
B4-4 is the epitome of everything Tim & Eric strives to be
I wonder what hilas parents think of Ethan. I bet they are disappointed
Still a better story thanTwilight
Hey, Ethan. Just want to say thanks for helping out Cr1tikal. You're the real MVP.
I coughed all the way through, maybe I should get a necklace.
what the F*ck are you doing in a boyband
The one time nowadays a producer should've used Autotune and didn't
lol
man this is pure laugh material
Ethan you fucked up
dammit than and your brack faic
can i buy dat song?
@8:37 you ain't shit nigga.
Thank you so much for getting the strikes of penguinz0's channel.
can i buy dat song?
Wasn't that song from 2003?
keeep the hair
I'm super drunk while watching this, but I know I had such a good time. Good video guys, such a good Ethan and Hila vid, the chub, the topic, the fun was best than ever.
I'm gonna make u come.............................OVER TO MY HOUSE
Negative fucks given.
We need a full version of this song. ASAP.
Ethan.

Real memers know that using spray tanners are not safe for your skin. That's why we have blow torches. It's natural heat, therefore it gives you a real, healthy tan.

You just gotta watch your health. You are the guardian of the Chub-'N-Tuck. We need you. YouTube needs you. And most of all..

America needs you.

Specifically Central America.
frank willin to swim in spaghetti and roll around in mousetraps but aint up for a lil bronzer smh aint no real ass nigga
I love how pretty soon there will be 2000s Nostalgia and "only Y2k kids get this!"-memes. I can't wait for a huge Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park comeback
For a minute there, I was worried your channel wasn't going to make it.
Moar collab with Michael :DDDD
Ethan forgot that in 90s he woud got teeth knocked out for that look
This guy is trying too hard now that he has 1.3 million subscribers. I miss the days when the videos were more shoddy yet real.
More than 1 of those young guidos look like Joe Pesci.  Ethan's eye contact and crazy upper body moves makes him look CGI at 11:25
I'm fully torped after this, those frosted tips got me
"You pc bitch"
That song at the end was amazing, also he looks like Enzo Amore.
wtf
how the hell are they able to make basically full blown films with loads of content so often?

honestly one of the most talented comedians/youtubers I've ever seen
Ahh the glorious views, look what it does to them. look at what it does...
2:12 HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH I literally reminded that like 5 times in a row, god Ethan,l you're so fuckin ridiculous!! I love it
How do we go up from this
i didn't find anything funny about this video, he is just doing weird things
1:04  Ethan wore his right sock on his left foot. A goofed and gaffed before continuing to watch the video.
My proudest accomplishment is that I never rocked the Puka shell necklaces, even when they were "cool"
yo where the fupa loss at?
I could go for a sodie pop right about now
Goddamn man, your videos is really getting better and better every time. Best channel on youtube!!!!
"You ain't shit nigga"
No.
2:18 ... enough said :)
Now, that was a riot.
Dude thanks for helping cr1tikal.
I won't lie, this is definitely me when I'M A BLACK GUY DA NA NA NA NA NA.
No one stops the bronzing.
lmfao "i'm going to make you jizzcuzzi with me tonight"
I actually think that song sounds good but those boys are fucking hideous . I'm ride or die for boy-bands but this is just a conflict for me where the music is good but the boys are ugly .
"You ain't shit nigga" lost it
Thank you. Funniest video ya done. Plus, im straight 4 frank
nice
Would bang.
This is why I fucking love this channel. Instead of just ripping on cringy vids like the million other youtube commentary channels that do the same shit, Ethan actually puts effort into making the video enjoyable. Keep it up !
AYY LMAO
13:15 what up heems?
Who wants to start a 90s boy band?
Try to stop me you fuckin PC bitch!! hahahah killed me 😂😂
That song was actually fire
Can't tell if it's Ethan or Odell Beckham jr
Holy shit, dude.
how soon until they're officially on Adult Swim?
Notification squad
Jon is wearing the same thing he wore in The Blizzard Rant.
More Frank please! That voice lol
its funny cus your theme is 90s based
fuckin' gold.
i have a hard on
"I noticed you have a surgical mask on coughs"

Jesus Christ my sides.
IT WAS JUST A TAN! IT WAS JUST A TAN BRO!
frank =/= pussy slayer
h3 h3 = drowning in 90s unshaven pussy
imagine if the gender roles were switched @ 2:49 ... a bunch of grown ass dudes feeling up a little girl
Their spraying you down like a new Buick. hahaha Not even Kratos has that bronzeosity.
This is almost crazier than Frank's videos...
lol ethan you started to look like an Indian dude after tanning 😂😂
Ethan... are you wearing your wife's clothes?
wow he really went all out XD. GREAD JOB PAPA!
this was wierd
Fuck Fuck
First guy looks like soflo
Beautiful
That's it, he's peaked. It surely cant get better than this. My sides are cramped from laughing.
Huge shout out to h3h3 for saving penguin0/critical's channel. Thanks you.
I'm honestly laughing out loud holy fuck this was worth the wait
I only disliked the video so I can be the 1000th person to dislike it
lmao with that odell haircut
Bronze means 3rd place!
This was amazing, it almost makes me wanna do it (almost).
Honestly, if Jon, Frank, and Ethan formed a boy band together, it'd be golden. The could call themselves the Suicidal Coughing Echs. 

I'm patenting that for a lookalike band I'll be managing.
Ethan has a nice, firm ass. I respect that.
I got no further question then what the fuck was that ?
This was too much holy shit
Guys you realize he can just finishing shaving his hair and that his spray tan will go away completely in 3 days.
This might be my favorite h3h3 video so far. Well worth the wait. Papa bless
what an excuse to huff paint
Only a matter of time before Comedy Central tries to offer Ethan and Hila a show.
Love you guys :*
ethan ended up looking like a 90s movie, sexual ambiguous NY gangmember
I am fairly certain that outfit was late 80's bro.
Thanks for Helping out Cr1tical, finally some positive from YT. been seeing a lot of fucking bullshit on this lately.
Why was this song made
last video was amazing, this one sucked
I swear I thought one of the dudes was a tanned up Harry Potter
best in a long time. v funny
You know you've fucked up when filthy frank tells you you've gone too far...
i can see the subtle inspiration from tim and eric in so much of ethan's stuff and i love it
i can easily say ethan is my favorite person on youtube
"you look like a highlighter with down syndrome" - frank
Frank appears EVERYWHERE
I made the horrible choice of putting a face mask on before watching and now it's all cracked. Worth it!
"Bronze means 3rd place. You ain't shit nigga"
I'm a natural 3rd place, wohoo. Fuck the other contestants in this world.
Ethan straight up Buffalo Billin it
Wut? But also funny
the bronzed, frosted tipped gentleman looks like soflo
Frank's face when he's just sitting there watching Ethan dance, silently.
I don't why this shit was on my recommended feed fuck outta here with this gay-corny guy.
Some people can't handle success. Ethan can.
2:18 This is what happens when you don't follow proper chub and tuck procedure. Ethan I am not proud of you :/
skin cancer
fuck that was funny.
He looks like a baked potato
u nerd too roast ricegum
3:12 LMAO SHE SAID "YOU WILL?"  as if he never has before
Their noses reminds me of soflo's.
your so hypocritical  you tell soflo to not steal/ reupload licenced video   yet you steal b4b4 song and name b4b4 = h3h3 , ill make a h3h3Productions exposed video in a week .
I won't lie this is definitely me when I have frosted tips.
Great job!
I ❤️H3H3
Fox news will love this
When does the album come out, Ethan?
Dude... That getup is too fuckin much. NYC affords the power of anonymity to those that want to live the H3H3 I don't give a fuhhh lifestyle.
WHAT HAPPENED TO SEAN IN THE INTRO?!?!? I mean, I know he died of Super AIDS, but you could have kept him in the intro.
I liked that frosted curl-hawk
Damn. I don't think H3H3 is good anymore :/
The weird thing is that uh, he doesn't look that out of place in NY
Yo ethan, I just came from Cr1tikals video in where he talks about the fact that you helped save his channel from the strikes. I wanted to say thanks for helping out one of my favourite youtubers. Keep it up, proud of you ^-^
Lolz
Ethan sounds like drunk Randy Newman.
Now if only there was a new Filthy Frank video... hmmmmm
oh my god what a legend.
This on iTunes yet?
This is what happens when an Israeli meets the music industry.
BRO TRY TO STOP ME FROM BRONZING
crap
Ethan you have the Coolest friends ever dood
Heard you helped out a fellow youtuber, Cr1tical.
Good moves Ethan, keep it up
Do a Q&A! and if u do r u from Israel?
The pop music in the 90s was so much fun lol
ahh yes. they bronze jew twins of toronto <3 my childhood
Dude, you saved Cr1tikal, thanks Ethan!
please do more movie reviews, just like that Jack and Jill movie
We all want more, cause your My papa and I want to you apprieciate me daddy like you never have before
LOVE YA
Ethan's pretty awesome for putting himself out there and is able to make fun of himself.
I feel like if I don't know who Ethan Klien was and he was walking down the street i might mistake him for a retarded homeless man
He's one of the rare channels that just keeps on getting better throughout each month!
That's fucking dedication to a video holy shit
Great moves Ethan keep it up
oh shat the song was actually  sounded good. but the freaking lyrics man wth
Less of a reaction and more of a mockumentary... Still love it though!
people hate on boy bands but we ALL listened to them when we were kids LOL #90skids
It's a shame you gotta bring that jontron douche on your shows. Quick way to ruin a video.
how could you?!? YOU RUINED YOUR BEAUTIFUL UGLINESS!!!
I was dying at papa franku part.
Song at the end is dope af

I'm gonna make you jizz-cuzzi with me tonight ethan
Didn't they have 1.3 mil?
Thank you for uploading dad
your alive!!
Hey Ethan.  I'm just commenting here to say thank you for helping Critikal deal with the strike crap on his channel.  You're honestly an amazing person for doing that.
ARE YOU CRAZY?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?! ITS TIME TO STAHP.
damn son H3h3 you sexy as fuck with dat bronze
Anything for YouTube views. Original comment
I like how all of the band members are Jews from toronto. Makes sense
Is no one gonna mention how Ethan is not even that bad at singing?
Solid gold.  If you weren't already married, I'd ask you to marry me.
this was the funniest video ever oh my od
you know the meme goes to far when you thought  he meant Ethan Bradberry
TAN NATION
i shat MYSELF
Anyone else notice Ethan just randomly have a water stain on his shirt 😂😂😂
Ethan showing all dat skin.....woooooo
That was as painful to watch as it was funny.
A big moist thank you over from penguinz0 channel. Ethan you're a savior
You look good tan, daddy
I think we know where Patrice Wilson started his career... It all began when he picked up those glasses
Ethan has gone 2far
#makeyoutubevapeagain

Thanks Ethan.

I'm pretty sure it's hard to come up with original content dude, but keep it up. It's worth it in the end.
Hahahaha had to throw in the vape nation
Why do you guys even watch this poor guy? He has no talent at all.
I mean if you compare my videos with his, he can't sings nor communicate properly!
you saved Cr1tikal!!!
"Clean cut charm of a boy band front man"
When is it going on iTunes?
The way he walks 😂
Great job helping cr1tikal, dang watching his recent video almost made me tear up haha . You the best, papa bless!
That 90's look was killer. Believe in yourself and don't give up on your dreams. One nine nine zeros for ever.
Hey, I'm from Cr1tikal's channel. I just wanna say, we really appreciate what you did for him. Thanks a whole lot from a new sub. <3
I can't imagine if you're my dad, you'd embarrassed me all the time.
Ethan, great video as always, but I just wanna thank you for helping out Cr1tikal. You're both amazing.
that was so lit
Wow Ethan, GREAT MOVES.
am i the only one who noticed his dick silhouette at 9:09?
Yo Ethan mad respect for helping Cr1ikal get rid of those strikes. You did Youtube a good justice.
Ethan i just wanted to say thank you for helping Charlie out with his YouTube strike issue. it means a lot to see the community helping each other
This is why I fucking love h3h3
Cringiest guy on youtube ever sings(gone sexual)
5:12 god damn that's the meaning of swag right there. Drinking wine out in the middle of the city in a robe, frosted tips, and 90's clothing. Gansta as fuck ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
905 people are from the 80's
Is it wrong of me if I actually enjoyed your song Ethan?
Ethan............ wtf are you doing dood?
thanks for helping cr1tikal
ethan kinda looks like a Jewish Aziz Ansari !
I was legit crying
Hey Ethan I heard you helped my boy penguinz0 out, right on man.
what monitor is ethan using
I'll be honest, I like the idea of satirical documentaries but I feel brandon rogers does them more. Idk i just prefer your response videos
h3h3 my favorite youtuber!
I first read this as Elton johns a boyband
I was always a little nervous of going to New York cause I've heard it could be pretty dangerous, but if Ethan can do this kind of shit and live then I think I'll be safe.
Ethan wow this is a whole new dedication to your craft. Good job, man.
Good work on helping restore cr1itikal's account. 

Great moves. Keep it up. Proud of you!
"And no one is getting down on me, I can tell you that for sure."
Shots fired Hilla
For the love of christ jon and frank need to do this with you
Best H3H3 video! LMAO
i've never noticed how big your head is
Wow Ethan nice moves
Jesus christ Ethan what are you doing lmao
8:33 "You aint shit nigga" rofll.
It's so gay that even your gayness can't compare! CAN.NOT.
Did that lady really pick her nose?
This guy looks tired, he should give up the fight.
4:20 Damn d00d did you get shanked?
He's back!!!
Israeli carrot lol
THIS SHIT IS AWESOME!
H3h3 aka HEHE genuinely scares me now I'm scarred for life
ethan has no shame XD great vid
Maybe I made a mistake subscribing to this channel, but at the same time made the greatest decision of my entire life.
You're a disgrace to the 90's so is that band
Ty so much for helping cr1tical
Jay and James roll tape, I'm ready to...
I thought those faces in thumbnail were photoshopped.
"bronze means 3rd place, you ain't shit nigga"
Lmao he really got a spray tan. He's serious about this shit.
HAHAHA! Holy FUCK the cringe is too strong
Ethan shortened his life by 10 years because of that spray tan.
you the best
OMG ALL FOR THE FUCKING FANS! HIS DEDICATION IS BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
I knew he was gonna get a tan
ethan actually has a nice singing voice
holy shit
Is this song on iTunes?

Thank you guys so much for helping out cr1t1kal's channel. great moves, papa bless.
Thank you guys so much for helping out cr1t1kal's channel. great moves, papa bless.
this is cancer
Ethan is slowly killing himself
One problem...b4-4 was formed in 1999 and this song is from like 2003. I feel betrayed
Oh God... Has he finally hit his midlife crisis?
I've been waiting for this moment.
Ethan is a mess.
You're so stupid ethan, thats not vr, that's a viewmaster. Did you even live in the 90s
thanks h3h3 #Penguinz0
V A P E N A T I O N
Damn, there's h3h3 bots now with those most-likely malware links smh
"But my skin wasn't dark enough," first time someone's complained about that lmao

This is why DJ Khaled is avoiding you guys

90s ethan looks like a huge scum bag
Thanks for helping crit

2:06 lol i thought he said imaqtpie was bronze (league of legends)
i thought that Ethan Bradburry was the one that joined the 90's boy band
Ethan looks good with that tan
When ever music plays and he dances I can't take it. 😂😂
Those socks and sandals tho!
Thanks for bringing Critikal's channel back papa.
Epic 90's prank (Gone wrong) (Gone sexual)
IM ETHAN BRADBERRY
RIP Ethan Klein (Cause of death: cosmetic poisoning due to midlife crisis). June 24th 1985 - April 16, 2016 :(
Wow Ethan, great moves, proud of you! #PapaBless
Imagine if this song had jontron filthy frank DJ khaled and Patrice Wilson
Oh My! 
The Trump/Jersey Shore spray-on dago tan shall never die! 
Wait! What about those super-plucked metro-homo-sexual eyebrows?
That's why your '90's pump-boy experience failed. 
You need the brows, dude.   Do over!
but that song came out in may 2000.
This is why terrorists hate America/
That's your best video so far, keep it up!
Holy shit, this is the best video you guys have ever made! Brilliant!

Ethan jumped the shark.
Ethan looks like 90% of guys I see trying to cosplay
Nice job helping cr1tikal ethan

Guy Fieri is what I thought of when he said frosted tips
The 90s were pretty much just a giant crime scene.
frosted tips.
Ethan dude you took ur videos to the next level with this one u literally went tan and shaved ur head and made a song for your video true commitment brother. Your freakin hilarious btw keep it up Ethan u made me laugh so hard.

H3h3production (gone too far)

0/10 needs more Patrice Wilson
XD you guys truly are the best.
1 sub = fuck 90s Ethan
I prefer the original intro track.
This song is about oral sex. And was on ytv, which is primarily for children.
Amazing level of dedication man lmao
Not gonna lie that was abit cringy when u stared at the camera
papa franku
Omg 12:46 is the best part HAHAHAH

This is golden
As a canadian this song is nothing new to me, this song is super fucked up and so is the video.
Holy shit dood omg this srsly dedication
BTW Some fags have recently been posing as youtubers on there channels and posting links. If they don't have that verified tick it's a fake.

HEY GUYS, IAM ETHEN BRADBERRY!
B4 looked like 3 Vitaly and SoFlo clones gone wrong (gone sexual! In da suburbs!)
H3H3 is back awesome video dude!
God damn boi, when Hila said "You are?" after Ethan saying he was gonna make her come tonight was brutal.
I always thought the guys from B4-4 look like Troll Dolls.
Not gonna lie this is totally me when I join a 90s band
POOOST MOOOOAR
views... anything... for views...
dude ur so dedicated to making people laugh i love it, seems very rare nowadays.
Jeff Dunham does not miss the 90s
To quote George Lucas, "I might have gone too far in a few places."
SOOOO ORANGE!
The most fucked up thing is that you can see a YTV watermark on the video for B4-4...
13:20 always have to throw in the vape nation lol
I need to buy your hit song on iTunes .
h3h3 you are unfunny, you have to try so hard to be funny but it's not working.

12:10 the way he says "frost" makes me happy
I seen you before... Your the pedo-man that raped men that raped me
#FREEMYNIGGASTRATOS

Where is the iTunes link?
For some reason I read the title as "Elton John is a 90s boy band"
they are a canadian group called ryan dan now. somebody post the video to their twitter lol
I actually like his singing voice. he could be really good omg
This was some Patrice type shit
11:26 your head looks  so huge
lmfaoooooooooo, the commitment is real, that shit was hilarious
damn the weird thing is, the song was actually good. idk man you do have talent
Add it to iTunes please !!!!
this was worth the wait :D
I need that song on iTunes
ethan bowie
11:50
Hila didn't stop him from going this far. This was probably her idea. H3H3 IS HILA!!
All of the band B4's record sales just shot through the roof thanks to Ethan

Up next: SKIN TAN INDUCED LEUKAEMIA RANT

#MakeAmerica90'sAgain
Give this man the oscar #Bronzeface
damn I really missed the H3H3 intro dude. Great video Ethan, keep it up, proud of u. 
PaPa Bless!
This was so cringey but still another good video
We need a song of your bronzer fading away like your boy band music career.
Absolutely hysterical! Great video lol
This is gold. Pure gold. I can't remember when I last laughed this hard
Lol this reminded me of I'm Still Here with Joaquin Phoenix
ISRAELI CARROT
Best video on the channel
FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A NEW H3H3! MAN I MISSED THE THEME SONGS!
I never thought "great moves" in your intro was foreshadowing for boyband choreography
i masturbated to this vid
how dare you cover up that mini-fupa before I could climax. Shame on you Ethan.
worth the wait!
Ethan is a fucking legend
this is so fucking funny
Damn Ethan u thicc 😫😫😍😍😘😘😝😝❤️👉🏻👌🏻
For some  reason Ethan reminds me of Cristiano Ronaldo.
OUR MEME LORDS MUST UNITE!
you kinda look like a chicken
Did somebody mention C U R R E N T Y E A R ?!
He looks like Josh Koscheck!
"I'm gonna make you jizz... cuzzi with me tonight." those lyrics really touched my soul.
No balls.
I kinda wanna see more of Hila in videos. You seem kinda self centered when she doesn't talk.
amazing
Wow Ethan, great moves, keep it up, proud of you.
YTV! Dam son that was the shit.
Looks like Donald Trump tried to look like  90's boy band member but gave up mid way.
The second guy looks like Bonnie Rotten
Dude that was 80s not 90s...AGHHHH
Officially my favourite youtuber. Ethan has always been a favourite but this video pushed him to the front of the list. Love you too Hila.
# UniteJonFrankEthan
"you fucking pc bitch"
Is it called H3 because H is Hila, and the 3 is the E backwards form Ethan?
JON
fucking hell Ethan you out did yourself yet again hahahah
Unsubbed. This video was funny at first, but I'm tired of seeing the other youtube celebrities. I don't watch your videos to see them.
israeili carrot... hahahaha

Also, I love how papa franku continues to talk shit as ethan falls to the floor.
9:14 *A trashy gypsy.
12:26 where the cool kids hangout xD
Ethan has completely outdone himself this time. Fucking keep it up I'm so proud of ya.
Wow Ethan great moves, literally
B44 is my favorite 90s band!
I'm gonna make you jizz -cuzzi

Kids be like "I miss the 90's" even tho they were born 12/31/1999 at 11:59 pm
Congratulations! You have officially had a mid-life crisis. How does it feel?
im not gonna lie. this is definitely a funny video
im not gonna lie. this is definitely a funny video
I would join your band
I want ethan to get down on me ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
11:24 Looks like some one pasted a SLIGHTLY larger Ethan head on Ethan's body... or something... it's trippy
Holy fuck. This is incredible.
Papa bless.
the greatest shit I've ever seen
I love how these videos are not just reaction videos anymore there more then that. like Vape nation then this mmm so so so good
Lol I thought it was gonna be Ethan Bradbury joins a boy band (forgot Ethan's name was Ethan)
Why are they so focused on this young boy ? Very strange ~ surely it would of worked better with an adult women.
I think I saw a little too much of Ethan today
Get down on me Ethan ;)
ETHAN IS A GOD!
ya look like a fuckin idiot
GREAT VIDEO!
I would buy that song




jk 




but I will
Comedy gold ... This guys a comic genius
You look like an Israeli carrot.
the Holy trinity in one video
Ethan your a pussy





Destroyer
This channel is going to end with Ethan Ironically throwing himself in front of a train.
I love how Michael has the fan in the studio still
1. Why do they all look like?
2. Why do they look like my sisters dolls?
3. Why do they look like soflo?
4. WHY. WHYYYY?
#MakeBlackfaceGreatAgain

Ethan flashing that fupa papa bless
#MakeAmerica90sAgain
This man has no fear.
Papa bless 🙏🍕👼
Hoping that Papa Ethan will be my spirit animal
looks like bbq sauce on his face at the end
I don't think anyone misses the 90s.
h3h3 and frank and all of their friend who are making video is next big thing
I dont know why but the songpart sounded like Cartman singin xD 
H3H3 = Cartman confirmed
8:26 I thought I heard boogie2988 there for a second.?
That whole quarter to 1 b5-5 tangent... Holy fuck I can't breath
Should have recruited soflo and the bradberrys.
northernlion would be proud
wow Ethan great moves
Dat ass doe
FUPA Overload!
T H I C C
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU JIZZ........!!!
90s Hen band
I feel bad that's I've only recently discovered Ethan's channels.
I did a search their stuff came out in 2000 not the 90's.
Lol not even missing a beat.
I think Ethan's hair pranks tie in well with when he's due for a trim. When the curl's getting too long, time to become a broccoli gamer, or an Israeli Carrot. When your due is due, fuck me up, grandma.
He T H I C C
Its just A TAN BRO { GONE SEXUAL }
2 words GAY FAGS
I'm gonna make you squirt.... Mayo all over my pizza thanks yaw
This was worth the wait
Top 3 favorite YouTubers right now, h3h3, JonTron, and Filthyfrank.
You are everything right with reaction videos on YouTube. You find something  and comment on it in an interesting and unique way. I really liked the part where you didn't watch the video silently in its entirety. 

Your commitment is astonishing. I'm gunna make you wash your face. With my dick juice tonight
2:22 The FUPA is real
"don"t talk." 
"Don't talk?"
Jontron 😂
Papa knows the definition of insanity
this is gold right here
Holy fucking shit, I tried to favorite this video like 5 times throughout and kept realizing that I already did. This was fucking amazing
Wow Ethan.. Great Job.. Keep It Up..
Put this song on iTunes.
Jesus christ Ethan you outdid yourself
neckbearddd
You weren't even around in the 90's, You look like you're 12.
so what I'm getting from this is 4 guy fieri pupae want to gangbang a homeless black kid
Were they intending to make the kid look gay looking at men, or expose the guys hes looking at as pedophiles, or maybe even both? (Nothing wrong with being gay, but that kid doesn't look it.)
HAHA im gonna make you jizz



cuzzi tonight lol
Cringe overload, watching this through facepalm of embarrassment.
oh my god. I totally forgot this song and how much I fucking LOVED it. ty ethan. papa bless u.
Anyone else get the feeling that Ethan just looks for the weirdest, most elaborate reasons to cut his hair off instead of going to the barber.
Hahahahahha Holy fuck
😂🔫🖕🏽
3than yuu inspire me dawg
Oh my god this is something else... 👌🏼
I knew I was in for a treat lol. when a new h3h3 comes out its like oooooooooooooooooooooo click
"Feel like i'm in prison" OFCOURSE you do with all that gas around ya Jew!
#auschwitz
Ethan's actually a really great singer :o
Ethans ballsack imprint at the end. Classic
I feel like h3h3 was a fan of cracked tv
best video you have every done lmao thats saying a lot youre amazing!
I wish I had as much balls as Papa Ethan. love ya
This is one of the best H3H3's of ALL TIME, hilarious..... I died every time he sprayed himself in the face. This channel keeps getting better and better!!!!!!
nice video ethan, this and vape nation have been by far your BEST videos
h3h3 is messiah
Ethan how do you maintain that extraordinary body
ethan Klein has ascended
ethan im worried about you
This niggas look like the Oompa Loompas
yup
Please stop pointlessly collabing with filthy frank, he's not witty nor is he in anyway funny enough to add something to the show.  Ty.
Better than Matty B. Man. How long have you been in the business? Dude. Professional. Like, 5 months dude.
I'm coming.... over to your house! Ha, got eem!
so fuckin cringe worthy, lmfao
"You look like an Israeli carrot"
i really hope you get cancer then announce it
then prank us
I'm definitely putting this song on my throwback playlist.  such nostalgia.  VN for life
yo they all look like soflo
I was really hoping Jon and Frank were gonna be in on it and they would become a 90s boy band with Ethan 
Shame on them... they'll be sorry when Ethan's single blows up on the charts.
U know it's a good day when h3h3 and ricegum upload the same day
memes
ITS JUST A TAN BRO
I subscribed simply because you helped penguinz0 get his shit fixed. Then I saw you are actually hilarious. This is a win-win.
Suits u Keep it on forever
next episode: Ethan's battle with skin cancer.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE A FULL VERSION OF THAT SONG
This is the best fucking video I've ever watched... great moves Ethan, keep it up.
You look fifty years old.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
( ͡⊙ ͜ʖ ͡⊙)
( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉)
Holy shit.... I thought the Vape Nation video was really good, man you just raised the bar.
YTV
I'm a b44kin as well ethan, I truly feel with your plight white privilege cis male something something
Lol this channel is one of my faves
I'm so sorry that you turned out like this
I really enjoy Ethan's singing
Every time I get a notification that H3H3 has uploaded I put my dick in something
Got some balls walking around NYC in that clobber m8 👏
Holy cow if i were 9 years younger id love that Bronze Balooga Bruiser to come into me house and have dinner with me and my family a nice bbq brisket
what could have been if Frank and Jon agreed.
All my favorite youtubers together. At LEAST a semi.
I'm fucking dead
You're the fucking best guys.
Not gonna lie, this is definitely me when I want you to come jizzcuzzi at my house
I am in fucking tears, Ethan you are legitimately the best there is on YouTube 

When the hell do we get an Ethan Dance Tutorial by the way D:
Yo, this song is from 2000. I dont know how you fuck that up.
this shit is fucking amazing
LOL
Ethan's 90s song is still 200% better than the mainstream bullshit on the radio.

11/10 papa bless.
VapeNation
Holly fack
haahahahahaahaa
i pee and poo my self at the same time lmfao
Ethan has the perfect body :O
Wrap it up boys Ethan just finished the internet.
The 80's does not approve
I totally feel that JonTron should be in a boy band. Have you heard him sing Firework?
Those grunts at the end of his song sound like the pigeons from finding nemo
11:24 Dear baby jesus in heaven... that is the most disturbed thing I have ever seen. The head just doesn't match the body. It's like a real life bobble head or some shit. I NEED TO SEE MORE!
If someone dresses like the boys in the song today they will be considered wild homosexuals.
+h3h3Productions You guys are awesome keep it up :D
Who else almost fainted when they saw Ethan new vid
Ethan you give no fucks man. That's something 1/100,000 people have lol.
Wow, this stuff is just GREAT
Im not gonna lie right now, but this was definitely me in the early and mid 90s.
OMG XD here's what the wikipedia says right now 

After break-up
After breaking up from the band, twin brothers Ryan and Dan Kowarsky formed their own duo group RyanDan and have released two albums, RyanDan in 2007. In 2016, they were featured in an h3h3 Productions YouTube video containing the music video of their song titled "Get Down".
Proud of you, Ethan!&!#;@($ Proud of you;;@(1
If you were born after 1997 you arent considered a 90s kid because you never experienced the 90s, just saying
\//\ #PapaBless
yooo wheres the soundcloud link fam
Ethan please make a T-shirt!
👽💬 ayyy lmao how'd you get Edward Snowden to take part in your video towards the end?
oh my god
lol I have seen EVERYTHING, i can die now
Why. hahaha goddamit
This is seriously one of the best videos yous have come out with thus far. I wish you well in your music career Ethan, keep it up, proud of you. Also d00d those tips are fuckin' dope.
I gotta say, I'm definitely liking videos like this, the vape nation, and the art gallery more than the old react videos. I hope these don't go away anytime soon.
Somehow as a young teen I did not understand that this music video was basically saying they were going to blow that kid, but only if he blew them first.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I'm dying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Holy shit , Ethan really gives no fucks
Ethan, what i love with you, is that u go through with everything XD especially the "bowl" cut, lmao. and now u take it to the extreme
epic
10/10 game of the year ign
You look like Uri Geller ROFL
We need a new B-quarter-to-5 song, featuring politikz.
Oh my god. Everything he did for this video lol
You fucking Israeli carrot
THIS IS TOO FAR OMG
Time for a bleach bath, Ethan
He should have said "My tips weren't frosted enough"
Ethan, you are my FUCKING HERO! Have my babies!
Literally deceased.
I want to download the song he made
you have bigger fucking balls than filthy frank
That was deep.
fuck yeah
we need your song on itunes
A little piece of the 90's died with this video...
not far enough! we can do deeper.
Guys, this is what cool was for 10 years
Ethan bradberry
Really appreciate the thought and effort in this video especially. Fully support you guys! PLEASE keep em comin'!

When filthy frank thinks this is cancerous, you know its real cancerous. lol
LOOOL when Hila did a close up to Ethan's face during the skype call with frank shit was funny was fuck
Wtf ur missing nirvana pantera and pearl jam
Needless to  say this is one of the top quality video on the youtube, Great Direction, Every element in this video is spot on.
Papa John is indeed judging us from heaven, and he says I can hear it, It's in my every vein, It's screaming out, and It says 
PAPA BLESS
Absolutely fucking epic. This is true youtube. You can't get this anywhere else. Thank you E&E, you two are gods. I am no longer an Atheist. :|
How does one 90's?
Someone is spamming the comment section with fake offers (calling them gifts for subscribers) pretending to be h3h3Productions. Beware!
Hey man thanks for helping out Cr1iKaL
If franku tell u goin to far... Man this is probably art put all under glass!
Damn Ethan you got Hila's hopes up by telling her she was finally gonna cum. You blew it dude.
You fucking tanned only your upper-body? What the fuck dude! HAHAHAHAH You're awesome! ^^
it's easy to get the golden hair Ethan...you can just grow some spaghetti on your head like Frank did for his rat chef..or ask Guy frieri..
Ethan you orange sexy bastard!!!
The darker the Bradbury, the sweeter the juice.
ethan, your hair reminds me of soft, steamy ramen noodles
i think this is too much
this is the funniest shit ever
Coming from FilthyFrank, this is really ironic, lmfao
lost respect for Ethan
1 like = 1 fupa
If you hate everything then do you hate yourself?






Oops! Wrong Channel! :( #SubscribeToIHateEverything
OMG ITS JOHNTRON!
has youtube gone too far
ETHAN I LOVE YOU
mvp of yt
Holy shit, I didn't even notice I was watching an H3H3 video until the theme song. I thought it was a Ethan and Hila video.
ethan is a Fuckin legend
Michelle Obama wants her dose of vitamin D;)
So Jon gets dinner, and Frank only gets a Skype call? I SEE HOW IT IS.
you really committed with this one
If he goes down on me, will he hold me down?
8:33 "you know what bronze means? bronze means third place. you ain't shit, nigga"

Thats what i would call "almost method acting like character dedication".
BLESS THE PAPA
ethan this is the best video i have ever seen in my life, what the fuck holy shit
Ethan letting the fame go to his head, some people just can't handle what comes with frosted tips and golden skin

Hey it's a new episode of funny clothes meme guy and wife, nice!
Ethan you better make Hila "come" tonight ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Good one LOL. :D The slight tan didn't look to bad.
Ethan seriously does go above and beyond the call of duty for these videos just to make a joke... and I respect him for that while respecting Jon because I think he made a good decision here
Man, you guys have really upped your game with these videos. Keep it up, proud of you.

Godly content.
Their skin is orange... it's fucking orange.
i yelled when the camera panned to jontron
Is it sad that I know this from Video On Trail? Ah, I miss that show.
time to ddos
why does filthy frank stand up for black face but says the n word????
E-male
You look like a highlighter with down syndrome.
H3H3 has gone from reacting to cringe to becoming the cringe! 👏👏👏👏Good job guys , keep it up!
"You look like an Israeli carrot"
Only 90s kids would remember
im gonna make you come tonight over at my house
Fuck the 90's.
A 12 minute unskippable mid video ad. Fuck Battleborn
90s subculture was okay
90s pop culture gives me cancer
4:23 that battle scar tho, back from Ethan's navy seal days.
Popular 90s culture always sucked.
Guy Fieri's and DJ Khailed's aborted fetus
still representing the vape nash !
8:50 I think I have the same monitor - pb278q :D
You're a fucking legend hahahahhaha
jontron is wearing the same outfit he wore for the blizzard video
i doubt 3/4 of the people watching this video were even around in the 90's ;)
"You look like an Israeli carrot." Go fucking damn it, Jon Tron...
too bad i ain't a 90's kid :((
Papa Bless that was hysterics hahaha
IM GONNA MAKE YOU COME gachiGASM
I felt if this was Fallout 4 I could scrap each of them for 1000 copper
Holy shit this was great.
I have finally finished EVERY h3h3 video up to this one. I am now sad.
i feel like ethan is at a mid-life crisis







that or he got extremely hung over
im gunna make you jizz...cuzzi tonite hahahaha
... WHAT?!
Man Ethan looks like someone out of the Fifth Element.
Ethan just evolved to his final form
2:13 HOLY SHIT
Tbh he should've just kept his hair blond and not cut it
You're a FUCKING LEGEND
At this point, Ethan is basically becoming a 1 sided Kenny Vs. Spenny
I won't lie
Fucking hilarious
Can I get this on Itunes?
this is true commitment
I'm gonna make you Jizz
HAHAHAHAHAHAH JIZZCUZZI
IM ETHAN TANBERRY
Hands down favorite video.
I knew he looked a little tan on the the other channel I thought I was crazy and out of my mind. I feel like Colby Pearson
Great video! But uh... who's who?
made my day papa bless
2:20
What the fuck... My virgin eyes have been violated
Did Frank say, you ain't shit nigga!?!? LMAO!!! These fools are HILARIOUS!!!!
Why is papa Franku here?
I was like "sweet, a new Ethan & Hila", but then I saw the intro and realized it was a new h3h3 video. PAPA BLESS
Imagine what could have been if Frank and Jon agreed. Please make it happen in the future man
I remember they reviewed that song on an old hilarious show called video on trial and saw this video, it was so freaking funny this song is a classic hahaha I love you Ethan, papa bless. gonna make you come tonight over to my house XD
Their skin color looks like they all have Addisons disease
This is fucking amazing
Would've been great if Hila said something like "That'd be a first" when Ethan said he was going to make her come :P
Should have shaved your beard. the 3/4 b4s were had none.
the start made me cringe but the rest made me laugh
Only 90s kids will remember this one
Ethan doesn't know what a View Finder is...
That black kid looks just like Tyrese Wilson
Thats pretty erotic
best video from you guys! i loved all of it! more of this please!!!
YOU know what bronze means?! 3rd place, you aint shit
sooooo where can I get this on iTunes????
Wow Ethan great boobs keep them up
So funny
Did you actually do all this to yourself just for the video? Lol. Great moves Ethan.
Your fupa's very nice in this video Ethan!
the last time i was this early kobe was still in the NBA
The bar has been raised
I'm blown away. Excellent work.
Any one else think he looked like Odell Beckham when he started shaving his head
This is some Endless Jess shit, im loving it.
i think its time to lose some wheight ethan, that fupa is becoming more than just a meme
J I Z Z C U Z Z I
9:18 cameo from DJ Khaled
this vid made my undies moist
Ethan was never seen again. some believe he joined dj khaled in the woods. you can here his song playing along side with khaleds siezure noises.
My cousin has those same swim trunks
How the fuck are you shameless enough to walk around in public like that!?
Damn! Ethan sounds like Michale Graves!!!
Someone show this to JoshuaDTV
Omg, this video was amazing!! Keep it up, proud of ya!
Ethan reminds me of Enzo Amore
Ethan is the east atlanta SAN TA
Ethan sounds like David Bowie in  the Blackstar album
Wow Ethan, great job. Proud of you.
glad to know i can still watch these kinds of videos after all the pointless drama going on youtube
Good Titties...
VAPE TAN NATION!
Anyone know what speakers schmoyo has around 10:30 in?
youre going to break out so bad
This is one of the most charming videos I've seen in a while Ethan. The humor was spot on everytime and the guest appearances made it all the better. Papa bless you Ethan 🙏🙏
honestly though those shorts kick ass
"I'm going to make you come tonight....over to my house." That is such a Charlie line!
Ethan can be really creepy XD
I'm Canadian, and saw this video so damn much when it came out. This got played all the time on Much Music.
Haha, I love it when he does collab video
This is me when I get autism
You missed the perfect opportunity to play "Running in the 90's"
ethan should go emo, that would be amazing to watch
I could of sworn it said "Elton John joins a boy band".
where THE FUCK is lube up 4?
12:09 that's the sound from that gay ass Justin Bieber song LOL It's just a higher pitch and the last note is different
uh well ok, not sure what the point of this video is.
B4-4 didn't come out until 2000 you dumb fuck
You're slowly turning into Frank
Did Ethan just invent Tan Nation?
sounds a bit like Gorillaz tbh
"You look like an Israeli Carrot "
I fucking died
haha this fucking guy
Wow.
FRANK!
casual First Lady appearance
I'm not gonna lie, this is definitely me when I watch a h3h3 video 😂😂
im fapping so hard
Later Ethan was found dead from a tanning overdose. @R.I.PEthan
How extensive was the clean-up, dude? I don't know how spray-tan works, but I'd imagine it doesn't just come off with water.
"We've got frosted tips alert!"
Ethan is like the American David Brent
Ethan's face at 7:27! I wanted to give him a hug and tell him everything's okay. :(
Ya look like Guy Fieri mixed with Dj Khaled
keep it up
We need a FULL version of that song RIGHT NOW. I'd BUY IT.
my pussy got so wet when I saw frank
the guy at 1:23 looks like soflo in the 90s
Not gonna lie, but this is definitely me when i kidnap a young black kid and sing about going down on him.
Ethan looks like a homosexual.
OMFG PAPA FRNAKU ON SKYPE HAHAHAHAH
Da best
why does the first person of the band looks like soflo antonio😂
You know you fucked up when papa Frank sounds reasonable...
JESUS CHRIST this is too white
E t h a n i s T h i c c
Wtf.
You're looking like Bobo, dude!
*I feel like this is h3h3's Sisteine Chapel
What I get from this latest production is a bizarre, but profound existential journey. Ethan looking into his own soul, who am I? Who are you? Say my name! What is h3h3?? Second favorite part is when filthy Frank says "nigga you ain't shit" as you're collapsing on the ground. Something very. Weirdly post modern existentialist about that or sum shut
"What do you see?"
What do you mean!?

Sorry that was bad, I'll just sit here in this corner contemplating the meaning of cancer
"Hila i'm gonna make you come tonight...." 
"You are?"
Beautiful
Ethan and Hila I love u a lot 😘😘
Cant leave the vid without a vape nation at the end. haha
I feel like this is h3h3's Cisteine Chapel
Holy crap please let there be a band with Ethan, John and Frank - INSTANT HIT <3
○
\\    BRONZE DANCE
every day we get closer & closer to papa Jons light. Papa bless, keep it up.
Best video i've seen in a really long time.
I was crying when Hila zoomed in on Ethan's face during the Skype 😂
You mad geniuses! Have I told you lately that I love you? When will this be on iTunes?
I would pay real money to watch quarter to one B5-5 sing live.
Can't wait to see the next couple Ethan and Hila videos with the Israeli carrot
Wow, spray tan, great moves! Keep it up, proud of you.
I'm proud to be an American.
So cringe Hahaha, gotta love it.
first video since the feud



you're still fucking gay
Perfection
I'm so happy that jon and ethan did all these videos and stuff when he was wearing the shirt I designed and sent to him http://www.redbubble.com/people/num421337/works/10014409-banjo-unchained-prints-posters-and-shirt?p=t-shirt&style=mens
laughed so hard , I'm in tears ..g1
Best video so far
broccoli in the front, cauliflower in the back, and the Parmesan crust on it ALL.
Ethan coming thru with the Classiest! version! of Black Face!
This was a great video man!
This was a quality video. 10/10

Amazing.

Get your shit together nigga.
Anything for that youtube revenue
This is amazing
Back in the days. Sigh............
he is trying so hard to become a meme it's not even funny.
V/\
It's weird how people consider anything before 2005 the "90's" (this came out in 2003).
4:30 in and it's already looking fuckin' dooope!
Jew kids on the block getting lots of hits, New York pizza makes me sick
Ethan, I love you so much. YOU are the bomb friggin diggity dood
The Fupa is gone!
I guess we know where Ethan has been
I would join Ethan's boy band any day
this video goes above and beyond
I know it's got a solid 90s vibe in there, anyway the song is from 2003
11:26 watch how fucking big Ethan's head is
Take Sam Pepper, Ethan Bradberry and Soflo Antonio to your boy band
too hot for me babe
This video made me subscribe.
Anthony Fantano is feeling a strong 8 to a light 9 on this video.
When the browner haired sing that one line it thought it first said "Gonna make you cum over my hands tonight!" 




😂 I'm dying right now
ive never laughed so hard in my life
Im glad you're finished publicly throwing your friend under the bus and trying to stop him from making money. Pretty fucked up thing to do to a friend.
Search up RyanDan. Two of them are still making music and released an album in 2014
Wat?
"you look like an israeli carrot" -JonTron 2k16
Looks like Odell Beckham Jr. at 6:00
Holy shit.
Totally into the whole style of this. He should do more of these videos. Ethan's quests for acceptance, love it.
The song was actually  good 😂
You are a legend.
You are the embodiment of confidence at it's finest and funniest.
y do u do dis 2 urself
The 90s were even more 90s in the UK
That one dude looks like tim from tim and eric.
He hasn't taken it past anything. Ethan is NEXT LEVEL.
You guys went above and beyond with this video. I want to say papa bless but fuck that. I fucking love you guys so much, thanks for making my day. <3
Guys do me a favor, search up "Spinning around" by Jump5
The Jizzcuzi line was absolutely fucking killer
How in the hell did you get Angry Video Game Nerd to guest star in this video?!
Does he really not know what a viewmaster is?
Thank you for the birthday present this fine April 16th, Ethan.
My mom walked in so I switched to porn because it was easier to explain.
This is the best video ever, like literally the best video in the whole YouTube.
This video and the vape nation video are just pure youtube gold
One of your best!
ethan is a meme god
you now look like Stomedy Ethan *chronic cough
Dude please shave your hair I like short hair or long hair Ethan not the shit you have now. Jew fro for life
You know you've crossed the point beyond the Abyss when Filthy Frank tells you shit's gone too far.
LOVE THE LONG VID D00D
dammit the guy looked like solflo
This was so worth the 3 week wait!! Hahahaha
"get your shit together" papa franku 2016 your wish is my comand
It should be a red flag when Filthy Frank is saying that you took it too far.
Ethan do blackface next!
3:19 is that sweat? lmao
One of the best videos you guys have ever made. Papa Bless!
Ethan has ascended and trenscended.

This was a dope video!
We are living in the Bronze Age of YouTube I guess
spray some aids tonight
h3h3 album, and pink guy ? O_O
VapeNation \//\
Ethan ill get down on you
I read the title as "Elton John's a 90s Boy Band." I was not disappointed.
Ethan Bronze Berrys........or........back street black berrys!
I didn't know Donald trump had more then one son.
I thought you were talking about ETHANBRADBERRY
12:52 "Ay... ay...ayy... ay ay ayya ayy ayyayyayyaayayay ay a yay ya y ay ay ya ay ya ya y ya y ay ay ya y yeye ya yae eya eya yae yae yaeyae y aey yae yae ay     ayy hey     ehey       ................................................................ay"
This band was formed in 1999, how is this a 90's band?  More like early 2000s.
LMAOOOO. Jizzcuzzi tonight fucking killed me
That. Was. Amazing.
3:18 nice sweat stain m8
This video brought me a lot of joy. Great moves Ethan , keep it up, proud of you.
I'M EATING BREAD BARRY!
V\ jizz tonight
His hair cut turns me on
I wonder if Ethan made Hila come that night
You look like a gay Donald Trump with Down syndrome
You forgot to auto tune. You're not in the 90's spirit yet.
Anyone notice how the monitor went from acer to asus?
Papa really blessed us this time
B44 all look like one fighting game character but with different color pallets.
Alright, I paused the video at 3:45 and if this fucking guy gets a spray tan or frosted tips, I'm killing myself.
the goof history tho
why
This will be featured on buzzfeed for sure
I miss the 90's
I think this is the first video of yours that I've legitimately cried laughing at. Holy shit you are a fucking legend!
born in 99 still a 90s kid
Frank said the n word
The melody of the song Ethan made with schmoyoho is quite similar to John Lennon's "Stepping Out"
10/10 would puka shell again
Hype, a new h3h3 video!!!!
A classic video that I genuinely forgot about. These men (?) look like they are creations of a top secret Eastern European laboratory.
This... this may be the best video ever made.
HAHAHAHA SPRAY TAN XD
4:02
She's picking her nose d00d!
hey ethan I want to join the boy band
fupa confirmed
Tʌ
"don't talk shut your mouth" lmao
it's back
Unlike Chinese food, this video doesn't make me sick.
Filthy Frank's speech to Ethan was the same speech Ethan gave to Filthy Frank on FilthyFrank's channel
Holy Jesus, what is that?! what the fuck is that?!
Yeah tell Smhcmomoo to go back and autotune this vocal
96/10, like skyrim with spray tans
His singing is actually not bad lol
More of this
Is this on iTunes
wow, that was an amazing video, keep it up, proud of ye
Wait a minute... the guy at 0:21 looks like a long lost triplet of racka racka
Ten girls suck each other dicks? That is so Ethan Bradbarry.
Ethan you look absolutely disgusting
TFW this song was made in 2003
Woah. That had it's own level of intense.
My lord I couldn't miss the 90s less
LMFAO @ 5:06 !!!    Ethan, nice moves!!!  You've outdone yourself with this vid!
This was awesome!! All the haters must not have existed in the 90's
i bet ethan smashed her pussy when they hit 1mil subs.
The things you do for goofs.
That's hot as fuck my boy
the one on the right in the back looks like ethan brad berry...
Can anyone tell me why FilthyFrank looks the way he does now? (cap and sunglasses)
Can we get some love for the ISA One in the Schmoyoho studio tho
wat the fk?
Song should've been called Vape Naysh
so edgy, 8/8
i was born in the wrong generation
Still rocking the chub and tuck!
Jontron has time for this, but not for his videos?
where can i buy this song plz or download?
LOL I can't believe he did this, omffffffg, he's doing way things too literally, jesus.
Quality content Ethan and Hila!
that was.....interesting?
#Anythingforviews
The guy with the red hair is fucking terrifying
Where did ethan get those sunglasses from the intro?
90S<3
I couldn't hold in my cereal while watching the bronzification and the process of those frosted tips.
Let's go silver tonight.
Loving the increasing in collaboration with other youtubers.
unsubbed bro. i not entertained
5/7 Its just perfect maximum score
react to german forklift operating tutorial
I'll get down on you, Ethan. With Hila's blessing, of course.
I lub da h3h3
How many Legends can you fit into one video.
8:36 filthy frank says nigga
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH LITERALLY LMAO
I was born in 1999, so I know exactly what you are saying; I mean, how else could I remember Number Cruncher?  We had the coolest childhood, remember the sound of dial-up internet?  #YouWon'tRememberThisifYouAren'ta90'sKid
That was a weird one.
Ethan has a great ass tbh. XD 9:35
filthy frank at it again with that cancer
Spray Nation.... Go Bronze
You look like Odell Beckham Jr hahahahahahah best video ever man
Thanks for the fresh meme cream papa Klein
Israeli Carrot has got to be the funniest shit ever
when ethan becomes cringe
Ethan looks a bit like Robert Downey Jr.
Vape naish V/\
The things this guy does for youtube😅😅
I was born in the wrong generation
I hope your mother doesn't watch this video
\/\
kids these days aren't alive, they should've been born in the 90's.
EVERYTHING was way better back then.
If I'm gonna go it alone, I better do it right. With the only boys I ever loved, B44. And if they're before four, and there's only one of me, I guess that makes me, a quarter to one. After five. Which is before four I'm five. I'm B5, quarter to one, quarter to one o'clock before B5. Before there was 4, before there was 4, there was B3 - But I'm after 4 so I'm actually b5,  -  and I'm just one dude so I'm quarter to one. Quarter to one B55. 

+h3h3Productions keep it up, proud of you :D
I'm pretty sure this is the best video on Youtube.
Jon and Papa Frank were right to choose not to be a giant disappointment like you
"you look like an Israeli carrot"
lol do you make a video every time you need a haircut? if so then thats fucking genius :p
best song out there
Is Hila his wife or relative?
Ethan! You're Awesome!

ZYZZ?
2:03 cmon now qtpie is my boy
Where's Donko?
Holy fuck ethan. I want a full mixtape. Your voice is incredible.
Wow... Umm I don't even know anymore. It's more and more not about videos of people. And instead about Ethan doing borderline "social experiments" and seeing people's reactions. It's not in the same way as others. But is the same idea. Doesn't mean I don't like it
papa bless the 90s
Do you just make videos like this when you need a haircut lol
This is my proudest fap.
NOOOOO! NOT THE JEWFRO!

Reported for violent or repulsive content ;).
Just REALIZED that frank was wearing a fucking pilots helmet while he was telling Ethan off 






If he gets in a plane the world will die
You suck...😄
Peanut butter looking ass Ethan Bradberrys
Diggin' for gold at 4:01

you look like a highlighter with down syndrome




dead😂
dude you go above and beyond for your videos holy fuck
u sound like ilovemakkonen
i miss the 40s
watching Ethans immaculate tits flap about when he dances is godlike
If memes were drugs you would have caused me to overdose with all of the godly memes you've created.
Awesome video
3rd place, you ain't shit. Cx
Well im watching this tonight, and Ethan DID make me jizz, so....
Well meme'd.
I won't lie, the song is pretty dang catchy.
I'm from the 90's, and I can relate!
omg ethan, you are a true artist
I WANT YOU TO DRAW ME SPIDER MAN, DRAW ME LIKE ONE OF YOUR FRENCH GIRLS
At 13:35 he tans his dick
holly shit!!
This video is insanely good!!
So much work and it was funny as hell!
I LOVE YOU, You lovely jews
Faze rain is that you??
It's time to stop!
That song!
Ethan, you need to stop vaping. It's making you go overboard.
Smh that dirty lady digging for gold right in front of Ethan at 4:00
Ethan sounds like David Bowie when he sings
So...when's your album coming to ITunes?
We need a full version. I actually liked the song!
I'm early let's make a joke






The Originality of the comment
Ethan bradberry joins a boy band

This video has more cameos than a YouTube Rewind video.
I'm a 90's kid








Born on December 12 of 1999
I puked
I'M LOVIN IT DUD

"You look fucking stupid, you look like a highlighter with down syndrome." - FilthyFrank 2016
"A highlighter with Down syndrome"
The fuckin 90's. I miss them so much.
AWESOME VIDEO WOOOOO
lmaooooo by far one of the best vids and worth the wait clapping emoji X3
#thankPapaforspraytans #frosted #justthetip
You know what you're doing is fucked up when FilthyFrank tells you that you're taking things too far.
Slowed the upload rate, but the wait has been worth it these past few videos. Being subbed to both your channels is a treat
in
Itunes pls bb
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Sadly the 90's is making a comeback now
whats with the ad half way through the vid
The next video will come next month I guess. :(
daddE
Awsome worth the wait great job guys! Still loving Ethan and Hila channel but nice to see h3h3 vids!
COMEDY GOLD
Papa Bless
how low you gotta go in life when FF himself tell you...you gone too far
Ethan Bradberry
i got as bick dig as u :D
Watching of Saturday April 16th, this is the funniest thing I've seen all week AND all month.
b-4 4... so 3?
get ethan bradberry and ethan klien in a boy band and call it ethan past 5
Omfg I did not expect Jon to be in the Video holy crap
The closest we'll ever get to new Jontron content.
LMAOOOO
My mom walked in, quickly switched to porn as it was easier to explain.
Logic Pro FTW!
Oh my god I have the same shorts!!!!
He HAS taken it too far.
that thing is called a viewmaster, not virtual reality. that thing has been around since the 40's.
"You look like an Israeli carrot" -Jon 2016
Wow lmao just wow
Fuck! before the intro I thought I was in Ethan and Hila channel haha
Jon is looking fiiine.
bronze means third place you ain't shit nigga xDDDD
"Bronze is third place" lol
this title exites me greatly
Have you ever seen the atty wrench ads. They seem like a perfect follow up to the vape nation vid. Perfect for the nation!
4:02 she was gonna eat that booger but since she was on camera, picking it and stashing it happened. COUGH
ethan has fallout new vegas on his task bar woop woop
This stuff is hilarious!!!
im ethan breadbutter
The fact that the camera couldn't focus outside the cafe Jon and Ethan were in, making the background outside the window white makes it look like Jon and Ethan are in heaven, which perfectly suits the video.
that first guy who came up in the b4-4 video reminds me of soflo
Is it bad that I really want a full version of the song at the end? Its so goddamn catchy
Ethan is a living meme and a national treasure.
I'll be honest, I have a thing for men with a little extra junk. Too sexy for me to see past the first few seconds.
If John had any manners he would take that silly hat off
I'm pretty sure h3h3 is my absolute favorite Youtuber of all time
the funny thing is, before he put on way too much bronze tan on his fac,e it didnt even look that bad.
Oh
ethan why. save yourself. holy shit.
This was fucking amazing.
Ethan and Hila 🙏🏽
this is amazing .what a masterpiece
You know you're in a fucked up place in your life when you call Franku "P.C."
5:22 that face you make when you make her come...... over to your house
meh.
LOLL Jizzcuzi
I was crying throughout the whole video. Keep it up, proud of you, guys :D
DUDE how hard was it to get that bronze out?
It is funny watching person destroy physical appearance.
My mom came into my room when i was watching this so i switched to midget porn cause it was easier to explain.
Your song's fire yo!
drinking pepsi max while i watch this lel :D
lmfao
noooooo Ethan you went TOO far lol
I can't believe how far he took this joke
U look like an israeli carrot
It's Just a Tan Bro
this man is literally a walking meme
Extra thumbs up! I was riding my boys dick to this. B4-4 Plotted 9/11
9:32 LAURENCE FISHBURNE???
First the vape, now the spray tan.....my god....


He's turning into a high schooler
Wow ethan is so brave how does he not get bullied looking like that in public lol
Nice little nose pick at 4:02
5:18 Damn that lady was smiling, pretty sure Hila is seriously JELLY.
90s chub n tuck
lmao not even 2 minutes and i died
You took too much man,... too much,... too much.
Dance in part made me cry 😂😂😂😂😂
not your best work ethan
but ethan wasnt a kid in the 90s
This is unreal
He's so extra lmfao
spray nayshe yall
nice nipples
Fuck, the 90's were damn awful. Just, awful. I aged from three to thirteen during the nineties, went through all the most awkward phases you go through in life during that terrible decade. Everything about it was just terrible, the music, the movies, the television, hell even the video games. Of course not every example of the aforementioned were bad, but the large majority was really awful. Shit didn't really get better till the early 2000's.
This is probably my favorite H3 video of 2016 so far
ITS JUST A TAN BRO!!
Well Ethan? Was it worth it?
ask soflo antonio, he'd be down to join for sure
HAHAHA😂 ETHAN LOOKS LIKE SHIT
I got so down to this :D
Bronze like my ELO
oh my fucking lord...
Funnily enough, this song is actually from 2000.
ethan how does it feel to have become a living meme
Hila must be so proud
when you liv' a world where Frank is saying what everyone wants to say.
dedication.
omg 10/10 would wank again
Is this the origins of Patrice Wilson?
You know is too much when even filthy frank isn't willing to do something for you
Scored tickets to the RyanDan concert in T.O!
THE DREAM
Bitch, I read that movie already, can't fuckin fool me
Are these guys Donald Trump's kids? lol 😂
Will this song be availed on iTunes? It's lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tanned Ethan looks like a homeless man.
This was the fucking best, don't ever change 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻💯😂
Hahaha and I thought going out in public dressed as the vape nation guy was bad.
hes finally made a video
Wow Ethan, nice ass, keep it up, proud of you!
This should be called Ethan gets Odell Beckam Jr's Hair
ETHAN BREADBERRY
Vape nation
Super funny guys.
"Israeli carrot"lmao
H3h3 deserves the fame they have right now
HE CALLED FILTHY FUCKING FRANK A PC BITCH
I told a girl that vape nation was a gang, and im in it, when she looked it up and saw ethan i said it was our gang leader, n she STILL believed me... She now thinks im a gang banger
V/\
Seems like Ethan is on a quest to become a living meme in these past few videos.
I can't believe you have actually done this...
YOU AIN'T SHIT NIGGA
you know you done fucked up real bad when filthy Frank tells you you fucked up.
This kinda reminds me of an episode of Review
He looks like he's on Jersey Shore.
#KeepOnBronzin
Oh my god the wait was worth it!
it would be really 90s but get Pitbull on this song and it will be a worldwide hit
I'm gonna make you come tonight, over to my house! lol
Make You Jizz Tonight
"you look like an Israeli carrot" holy shit
Who else thinks the blond guy looks like one of the racka racka twins
that was amazing
yooo ethan u hav no chill
Only Ethan Klein. Thats all im saying XD
Ethan, I love your voluptuous form. You're beautiful, never change.
Did filthy frank call Ethan nigga XD
LMFAO I had to keep pausing the video I kept dying from laughter
I thought there was 4 of them before I saw the band photo
Dude you're loosing it
Hey Ethan, 'that's a ten' badum chh
Damn it, thought you found that Ethan Bradberry was in a boy band when I read the title. Still good tho' XD
The only other person whom I've ever seen cover this video was a dude named Michael Swaim for his Cracked TV show... This video is DEFINITELY about homosexual pedophilia.
Too much 😂😂😂
Damn, the contrast of Ethan's bright clothes at 9:24 to everyone else's dark boring clothes is funny, great shot
The amount of dedication that went into this video is ridiculous
Make a rant video about Vegan Gains please.
WHY DIDNT FRANK TELL HIM ITS TIME TO STOP
AY AY AY AY AY AY
How much for a feature, Ethan?
When I saw this video I thought "three fucking weeks for a boy band joke?" and then I watched it for all of its glory.  Ethan, that was modern art.
It would have been amazing if Jon and frank did it too and they could have had the bronze brothers jizzin on little black kids
I'm actually crying with laughter omg
I am 69 and I wish more people from my generation could appreciate this
Why dude :D
There's so many layers to this video.
DOES ETHAN HAVE NO SHAME
Come over my body
good memes
Ethan you is one devoted son of a bitch.
Nothing to see here. Just a Jew missing the final years of the Soviet Union.....
Ethan this is literally the greatest thing you have ever made.  I have tears streaming down my face.  I had to pause several times to catch my breathe.  Holy mother of god.  11/10 would write a tumblr post about it
That Bunch n Roll was on point Ethan
Now all you need is cocaine
guys this is probably the best video you've made. love ya, appreciate ya xxox
Help me please, ethan made me make vape nation stuff on redbubble...
"2016 Socks dude"
u aint shit nigga
Was anyone else watching h3h3 already when this went up
This video would be fun if you shut up and didn't do the commentary and it was just about you joining a boyband
8:30
krazyfrank almost laughed lol. Ethan is 2gud
Chin
LMAO HOW THE FUCK FUCK DID THE WORLD COLLECTIVELY LOOK AT THIS SHIT AND BE LIKE "YES THIS IS US, THIS IS SO GOOD, THIS IS GREAT" oh wait, same will be said about all of todays hilariously ridiculous bullshit... damn people be weird...
Reaching Tim and Eric levels of god-hood.
Would of been better if it was coal chamber- loco. I remember when they had those VR Goggles in the video. Plus, it was the 90's
Anything for views.
vr goggles

its a viewmaster ethan no
terrble. 


I loved it
the irony of all this is that this song came out in the year 2000
I would love to see a 90's boy band consisting of Ethan, Frank & Jon.
that must have been the best shower of your life after filming that.
you went from vape nation to rape nation in 13:32 minutes... #fuckensickdude
AN ISRAELI CARROT
Im gonna make you jizz........ cuzie with me tonight. OMFG I DIED
biggest troll, I love it
LMAO I'M JUST FUCKING DONE XDDDD
Lmao that YTV logo tho
HOW DO THE VIDEOS ON THIS CHANNEL KEEP GETTING BETTER EVERY TIME.

Fuck's sake Ethan, slow down before you goof yourself into a wormhole or somethin.

Bradberry nation?
Maybe it's just me but I don't want to get into a jizzcuzzi...
this is a masterpiece
Still better than 1D
Funniest part is at :15. That last "ay". So delicately deliberate hahahaha
Looks like the longer breaks in between videos really are improving the quality of the videos. This was great lol.
CRAAAAWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIN!!!
We are truly living in the golden age of youtube.
The gap in between each of Ethan's videos is him recovering from the past video
he might be a douchebag, but he's a funny douchebag
worth the wait haha so fukin funny
One of your best, most elaborate schemes of a vih-day-o, Ethan. Papa bless.
I'm still confused to why they do not just use one of their channels..
Answers plz.
This should be NAMBLA's official theme song.
More H3H3!
Damn this guy goes all in for his art

Oh yeah dat belly doe Kreygasm

Guys, by liking the video you're enabling Ethan to act out this way. Ethan get a hold of yourself. #StopTheBronze
Ethan kinda looked like Ricky Martin after he cut off his hair. lol
just unfunny
Wow, good on Tim Heidecker for being every member of a boy band.
Why does Ethan sound like Bob Dylan
I was dieing when he started dancing
Schmoyoho is so irrelevant these days lol
instant classic
I love you guys so much 😂
I haven't laughed like that in a long time. You're a great comedian.

glad ,jon and frank made appearances here. too bad they didnt get on board with the full skit though.
soaked panties, man
holy shit
Takin he's a "clown" out of context
best video that's come out in a while damn
7:07 CSGO confirmed! Look at his taskbar. What a LEGEND! Global elite!
Ethan is like a walking definition of vaporwave.
sexy bois
you certainly have..... outdone yourself....
What about the 80's? Damn, this guy looks old and I'm older than he is.
Could you vape in the 90s?
HOLY SHIT. HAHA
Ethan and Hila, this is one of the best vids you've done. I'm impressed how far you've come. Great moves,  keep it up proud of you.
love u ethan, papa bless 10/10 <3
Boy they look like burnt sweet potatoes!
only 90s kids will remember WW2
FUPA LORD.
YOU GEL THE TIPS!!!
I am now painfully aware of a part of the 90s that I would have otherwise not known about great moves keep it up
TBH, the song isn't terrible, it's not cancerous at least.
😂😂😂 the songs so catchy. spray them aiiids yaah!! 💀🔥🔥😂😂
great ass ethan, keep it up
When Filthy Frank says it's gone too far you should really consider just stopping right there and now, and contemplate about the things you have done so terribly wrong
Ooh fiesty lil' thang!
'WHY DON'T YOU WRITE A TUMBLR POST ABOUT IT YOU PC BITCH' might be my favourite line in H3H3 history 😂
i'm kinda gettin sick of ethan
the first dude looks like soflo
Papa Franku's just mad cause he can't capture that sick 90s essence.




That line from Jon with the Israeli carrot was fucking magnificent though. This whole video was magnificent.
Eth, I've gotta say, the spraytan was some hardcore dedication.
HELL YES!!!
Ethan has stooped a new low, like holy shit.
Quality
To be honest you look a lot younger with your 90's flo
He has more Rolls than the New York Bakery

Paaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh         Haaa           Haaaa!!!!!!!!!!
Did Ethan get skin cancer making this video?
This will be known as the video that gave Ethan cancer.
I love u!
This was worth the wait
He has a good voice
Watched 3 times showing my GF and parents :) haven't laughed that hard in a long time.
He's walking like he shit his pants... twice.
Consistently hilarious
Ethan is one crazy mother fucker
thaTS SOME NEXT LEVEL H3H3 RIGHT HERE TBH
Ethan this was one of your most creative videos yet. 
-Not titled H3H3 REACTION VIDEO (VIDEO TITLE) in all caps
-You're not just making fun of the video the whole time

Don't get me wrong, your videos are still hilarious but the reaction vids were getting repetitive, but it's great to see you explore other comedy and showing you're not a one trick pony. One of your best vids yet.
0 shame
Does Filthy Frank have Jaundice?
I cant tell if the sweat rings were intentional or not...
FRANK SAID NIGGER
Ethan is the 90s <3 the frost tips amazballs
"You ain't shit nigga"
-Papa Franku
Wow Ethan, great moves. Keep it up. Proud of you!
At least he succeeded in looking like The Weeknd
Wow this video sucked                                                                                                        My dick and it felt so good
wow u have talent
the song cured my autism
I'll join your boy band
THIS SONG WAS IN THE 2000s
I love how every new H3 is like a short film, great moves, keep it up
3:08 Hila was actually lead on there for a moment
Just seeing him dance... omg 😂😂😂
Ethan, Hila, Frank, Jon, 90s, boybands. Man can this video can get any better ?
This is real content, make notes other reaction youtubers.
I watched this the first thing in the morning. What a great way to start the day (ᗒᗊᗕ)
why does this song remind of bob marley?
This is some next level shit.
Big Time Rush > B44
Lol that YTV logo, God the Canadian 90's
Ethan looking A E S T H E T I C af 
#VN
TIM HEIDECKER
2 hours ago gang! Squad Up!
9:18 IT'S DJ KHALED!!!!
the way frank pronounced "hila"
Even though papa franku and jontron haven't been together with ethan in the same video, I'm counting this
this video was fucking 10/10
"you look like an israeli carrot"
first
I'm not gonna lie, this is definitely me when I'm trying to be b4 - 4 but after 5 at a quarter to 3.
Ethan Bradburry, afraid of making fun of any youtuber because of recent events, decides to make fun of one of the easiest groups to target: 90's boy bands.
Pls, we need a full version
Look at the shit Ethan does for his youtube fans. LOOK AT IT.
Got about 5 minutes in and wasn't expecting much and wasn't really into it. By the end, I'd consider this some of the best h3h3 productions videos ever made.
The funny thing is, that song is from the 2000s
this song is an audible shitpost
Papa Ethan, Filthy Frank and Jontron all in one band? I would pop a couple sodie pops and watch that.
Love ya, many blesses.
When is Ethan getting his own show? He is already funnier than most late night hosts.
His hair could have been used in a cake. That's wasteful. Kids in Africa could've eaten that cake.
OMFG! YOU ARE A LEGEND!
that hair actually doesn't look bad on Ethan
Dem jelly rolls are payin tolls. Hot 4 90's
what the fuck is this captain double chin
Magnum opus.
Lord have mercy ethan you took it to the next level in content creation. Honoring your craft, mad props.
"write a tumblr post about it ya pc bitch"
Soooo... am.. when is the new album coming out?
bronze means third place nigga
Oh shit, I needed the laugh. Keep it up, Ethan. Great moves. I'm proud of you.

this is the best thing ever
I miss the 1990s, but certainly NOT boy bands..
I met the director of the music video once at a party. He told me it was the worst thing he's ever done. It was a magical moment.
Oh my god I so wanted to see BronzeTronze
Okay, I'll be back in a little bit... I have to dump some bleach on my brain to unsee that picture of h3h3 at the start of the video
.
Cal Chuchesta's favorite band!
The evolution of Ethan Klein
I rate this 5/7
when you have 0 shame
I appreciate the effort
lol filthy frank said, "you ain't shit nigga!" I lost it xD
s u c c
You missed it ethan at 9:18 the one the only DJ Kaled appeared.
ethan sounds like he could b a country singer
Fuck off this is so good.
I was born in 1998 so I'm a 90's kid
you ain't shit nigga
I wish i can get down on Ethan. Mmm, that sexy daffy trump style tan...
wtf is Keemstar doing in Ethan's video?
These H3 videos are getting so good holy fuck
\//\
has he finally lost his mind
I won't lie this is definitely me when I'm getting down.
Holy shit, Ethan's got some YouTube connections.
Lol of course this was on YTV...another fail for us canadians
Ethan had morphed into the cringe itself. He's been corrupted by his own meme.
the sack shot at the end made the whole video amazing
4954th
Satire at its finest......hilarious!!!
#FROSTED TIPS ALERT!!!!
Dude's WAY off about this boy band wanting to pound that black kid. He's way too old. Didn't Ethan get their name? It's fuckin "b4-4". BEFORE four. That's what they're into. That kid's at least eight. That's, like, double the age. Fukn A, man
i need the song at the end as a ringtone, where can i throw my money in ethans face to get it?
Ethan, you should name your boy band "Ethan and the h3's"
Haha, Ethan the legend.
have memes gone too far
low-key i'm trying to read those skype names
You look Like ernie from The george López ❤️
REMEMBER BOBBY'S WORLD?

IT WAS A GOOD SHOW!
"Why don't you write a tumblr post on it, you fucking PC bitch" 
Actual tears.
Does Jon have other sweaters? #Sweaters4Jon
Now THAT'S what I call art! Thank you :)
Epic, great video. RL Lols all round. Best h3h3.
Man... i have missed these videos.
Ahh, the 19000000000's, when true musicians lived!
PART 2!!?
don't you just love black face.
He looks like if Guy Fieri and Pualy D had a baby.
Omg. I can't deal with this.
I can honestly say that this is top tier, quality content.  Ethan went to the next level to bring us the most quality goofs and gaffs imaginable.  Amazing.  Papa Bless.
This... is the next level of h3h3! WOOOOOOO! In the words of DJ Khaled, "You a GENIUS."

I see why this video took so long to make now, he needed the right length of hair to sculpt himself into the contemporary GREEK MEME GOD we now know him as.
Great job Ethan, keep it up... worship you.
lmfao filthy frank
I miss the 50's
Isnt that black kid  the "boob watcher" from Role Models?
That song sounded straight out of Tim and Eric. Thanks Ethan, Great job.
That intro made me want to vomit
I was thinking about Oompaloompas
wow that was quality right there
In this episode: Ethan descends into 1990's-based madness and alienates himself from all 2 of his friends. [GONE PEDOPHILIA] [GONE RACIST]
If even Filthy Frank denies you, you know you're fucked.
those guys are fucking orange what kind of race is that
Where can I buy that fire track?!
spray & pray / Papa bless
let papa frank spit some knowledge on your tan
I'm at a loss for words.  Good job
ok hes alive and not dying from all the vaping


sorry vaping cures cancer im dumb
he definatly got skin cancer from this
[carrot intensifies]
ethan was kinda hot on that 90's thingg tho xDddd
Rip Ethan holy fuck he did it this time
This was beautiful, like the angels in Jewish heaven were in awe when their Devine ears heard this magnificent song of true art
Your utter lack of giving a shit is genuinely impressive, good job dood.
where are you brothers? #vapenation
Did anyone think for a second when they saw this video, that it was about ethan Bradberry ?
Biggest memes: 1. Filthy Frank
2. H3h3
3. Stomedy
Ethan dude , u just went full Super Saiyan there!
FilthyFrank 2.0
Ethan no longer gives any fucks hahahahaha
i died :D
what a goof
12:58 they should have played an "It's Ethan Bradberry"
Kinda looks like miguel
i hope everyone knows that they are only a 90's kid if they were born in the 80's or the VERY early 90's
Lmfao da fuck is in his vape.
You guys' dream is to roll up to DJ Khaled's on jet ski, my dream is to merely share a couple goofs and maybe a gaff with ya. Keepin' it real as fuck hahaha
was i the only one who thought it was about ethan bradberry
Ethan actually looks pretty good black-faced
i got to agree with papa frank. 2 far.
lol @ this jew
I want to see Ethan collab with Tim & Eric so bad after watching this
Yeah Ethan going deeeeeeeeeeeep for your vids
DJ Khaled at 9:18
Was that DJ Khaled at 9:17?
That kid in the video looks like a young Patrice Wilson.
This video gets a solid 1/10.



+9
i gonna make you jizzzz,,,,,,, cuzzi with me tonight best line
PAPA FRANKU
you look like a hilighter with Down syndrome lmao
I feel like this story lacked closure or any resolution.
10/10 would buy on itunes
"We here at h3h3 arnt assholes"
2:17, 11:20
this is the best video hes put out so far. i didn't stop laughing, great work
That's some genius shit right there
Now that's commitment to a bit.
Also Frank sounds like he could be Super Dave's son.
Johntron and filthyfrank!! Lmao
quarter to one five bfive
Guys you really stepped up your effort in this video, well done on this funny but entirely embarrassing cancer hahaha
Wow Ethan really outdid himself on this one
So where is the MP3 download?
what speakers are in the background 11:56
That was dope as fuck, SONGIFY THIIIIIIISSSS
Omg you found another video to make infamous
Ethan what the fuck?
you stepped up your game oin this one ethan.. liove you
When filthyfrank says you've taken it too far...
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay 
ay ay ay ay ay
AY AY AY
When Ethan was dancing it didn't even look like his head and his body were the same person.
What the hell is YouTube becoming?
how do we even top this



like as a species, how
Ethan has gone off the deep end.
B4-4!?! somebody call Northernlion
THE INTRO IS BACK FUCK YESSSS
"I feel like I'm in prison." Ethan, if you're singing that song specifically, you wouldn't want to be in prison.
Somehow you topped your vape nation video. This was amazing.
What the fuck Ethan.
Israeli Carrot!  xD  fuck me man
90s best time I can remember....








Jk it was fucking cancerous
"You look like a highlighter with down syndrome"
You should try out for SNL
that is literally the most cancer I've ever seen.
oh and i'm talking about you, not even the video.
8:35 you aint shit nigga
Grade A
I'm actually disappointed that Frank and Jon didnt get tans and blonde hair too. It would've been even funnier.
THIS WAS A 2003 SONG YOU FRAUD
Where does he get the courage to go out in public like this?
I'm sorry but this was really cringy. Joke or not, still cringy.
IM ETHAN BRADBERRY AND I VAPE PHAT CLOUDS
This might be the greatest video ever to grace this shithole we call YouTube
It would be amazing if Ethan recorded the whole song and sold it on iTunes or Bandicamp or something
is this son on itunes cuss its dope
Test
ETHAN WHAT ABOUT YOUR PRIDE
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PR

fuck it jk when did ethan have any pride or regrets
Ethan looked like Pauly D at 4:55
chub'n tucks on point 10/10
This is the day where Ethan Klein went too far
YTV!!!
The dedication is amazing Ethan. 10/10 Video!
Ethan=daddy? Idk but I need new pants now
if this isn't commitment I don't know what is
Damn dude
I love you so much Ethan. You have balls to do shit this haha, and big up to Hila also for recording haha.. Come to the UK PLEASE :D
Good to see that the FUPA is right where we left it.

And holy shit... You are a stupidly brave man, Ethan.
Ethan and Hilla - you are fucking brilliant! I didn't think I could laugh harder than I did at the vapenation vid but I did!!
Ethan thanks for sacrificing yourself for the sake of comedy. Seriously dude, not only do you sacrifice your dignity by going out in public wearing the most unflattering (but hysterical) clothes, but now you're damaging your hair, your skin... 
I just want you to know it doesn't go unappreciated. Love you bro! Keep doin what you do. 
Great moves, proud of you!
Is it sad that I knew the band in the thumbnail was B-44 lmao :/
ethan please keep that look for the rest of your life.
I can't believe Hila puts up with this shit. You guys are amazing!
who is the guy at like 7:30? he's not funny at all . . . .
This video got pretty dark at the end....
Love Ethan, Hila, and John but filthy frank and his fans are the worst holy shit
one of the funniest in a while hahaahaa
Reeally stepping up the insanity
Jesus man this was hard to watch. Since when did you up your cringe game?
Liek if ur ae neities kide heh
IM EYHAN BRADBERRY
'Firsth'- Mike Tyson
Ethan i think your vaping a little too much
The thought of a jizzcuzzi makes me cringe
ethan tryin out a new look with the chub-untuck at 2:20
Fatty
iTunes?
The legend is back
nigga looks like soflo from the 90's
finally!! the asshole is back
That cough at 3:48 was magic
Thanks Ethan, will definitely be trying out this look at graduation.
Oh man Joji's trying so hard to not corpse at 8:20ish, hilarious
The red frosted tip dude looks like Akuma
This is the best.
My dad walked in on the 80s songs and now he thinks I'm gay. Thanks Ethan.
he sounds like coldplay's main hoe
Ethan please get down on me
It says something about me that when I saw the title I immediately thought Ethan Bradberry Joins a 90s Boy band.
anyone else notice the YTV logo in the bottom right for a second. that's a Canadian kids channel why is this on there xD
wtf I still dress like that:/
Im sorry. But I liked the song. But hey maybe its cos im a 90's guy. <3 Much love
Thank god for Ethan Klein
J I Z Z C U Z Z I
how nice
Did I just see DJ Khaled on that subway train at 9:20
B5 vs. Politikz

who wins
The oompa loompas got out, Willy Wonka!
Schmo? The famous Titenic composer? Ethan's got connections!
ETHAN YOU LOOK 80s
Am i a 90's kid if i'm born in 95?
You've outdone yourself this time
"Why don't you write a long tumblr post about it you big PC B*TCH"...... I haven't laughed that hard in a long, long time. That, and Filthy Frank's bit at the very, very end. Ah who am I kidding, I was laughing the whole way through.
DAMN ETHAN, THAT ASS.
This video sucks compared to mine
When they brought up Jon and Frank, I was so hoping to see all three of them finally meet up with each other at the end, dancing and singing as a boy band. How fucking amazing of an ending would that have been
producer guy is slightly pretty
when he says hes gonna make hila come tonight she says no
I'm just gonna say Get Down by B4-4 was released in 2003 so I'm calling you out on your Bullshit Ethan 90's my ass
Ethan you've surpassed how much I can possibly love you. You're the best thing in the world.
So I'm the only one that noticed he hasn't uploaded on this channel in 3 weeks?
"You look like a highlighter with Down syndrome." ~ FilthyFrank2016
This is gold
Jon and Ethan having a talk, MEME TO MEME
Your videos are the only thing keeping me from killing myself
WOW!  Thanks for the new video.. H3H3 Rules!
You two have out done yourselves. Keep up the good work. Papabless
I bet Michelle Obama really loved the moves in this Vid. Keep it up 👍🏽
DJ Khaled is probably terrified to meet you now Ethan
I fucking love you, this is awesome.
Damn Ethan, that was fucking dark, and I don't mean your tan.
You know you've hit rock bottom when papa franku tells you to get your shit together
I cried with laughter. I've got give you massive praise Ethan ,Hila and all the other youtubers involved this was certainly a gem off a video. Thank you for making my day.
Papa bless
would it be latino face?
Reminds me of an old Northernlion binding of isaac episode
12:09
I chubbed to this video
Each video gets better and better. Wow ethan great moves, keep it up proud of you.
I was born in the wrong generation
#Anything4Views
I didn't think we'd get anything as special as \//\, but I think this topped it
where's the gofundme for the Jontron, FF and h3h3 band?
WHAT KIND OF DISRESPECTFUL SHIT WAS THAT TO REPLACE THE CLASSIC INTRO SONG
Does Jontron always wear the same shirt? Lol
DAMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Soooo when is your mixtape coming out????????
"You are?" ngl funniest, off-screen, sardonic retort ever!
3:08
\/ /\
Mabye Ethan should've recruited Moe Bradberry, he's boyband material(he's got the highlighted hair, the Mickey D's arch eyebrows, the metrosexual look) all he needs is a spray tan and a puka shell necklace.
This has to be the greatest video on the internet.

You look like an actual retarded homosexual. I love it.

That's a stereoscope bro. But that's ok, I forgive you <3
2:12
Ethan has the same monitor that I do!
♡
yuo
incredible
My favorite 90's band was Vanilla Drippings
I am always astounded at how far Ethan will go to make such beautiful art for us to enjoy, either that or it's just done as an excuse for him to cut his hair.
They look like some Dragon Ball Z villains xD
I couldn't stop Laughing Holy shit!!!
This is probably the best video you guys made yet and it seems like you are surprassing yourself with every video. This was just pure Youtube gold!
Funny shit
I have to admit, you pulled that ensemble together there at the end.

You should keep it.
Fantano better review that track
Fucking gold
Fucking love this video. Beautiful
upload more mine craft plese
I am potato
I miss the 90's, were Ethan Bradberry wasn't molesting and killing our children.
can't believe how fucking comitted he is to his videos
Oh, shit. The 90s had the craziest music ever. 98 Degrees, Backstreet Boys, N Sync...pop was running rampant lol.
Vids have gone next level
if this comment gets 300 likes i will donate all of my eight children to food aid in Africa
Quality entertainment!
U look like black hooker
Ethan has a teacher butt
dat indian beggar look omfg
/\/
The 90s gave birth to Barbie Girl and My Heart Will Go On. I am not nostalgic for those dark days.
The 3 guys all look like a hotter (Much hotter) version of SofloAntonibro.
Sex with Ethan must be terrible, we need to  do a rescue operation and save Hila!
wow Ethan sure is committed to his art :D
The guy looks like Ethan Bradberry
2:01 - 2:13 and i thought u said ur not 'fucking assholes' ....
This is hands down the best video I've ever seen on this site. You win Youtube, Ethan.
I feel like even in the 90s they had to realize how fucking weird that video concept was
Put it on ITunes.
Vape nation
can I buy that song on iTunes?
Cough of the year award goes to...    2:12
Fupa on point!
the end of evangelion of meme videos
Franks become a pussy,way to be committed Ethan lol
The NYPD are going to shoot Ethan because he looks like a gay terrorist...





with frosted tips
I miss Ska.
Wow, if you can make it through this video, it'll all be worth it
I thought this was about Ethan Bradberry joined a 90s Boy Band
The Tan lady picks her nose 100% @ 4:00... gave 0 fucks
desperately tries to read Ethan's Skype contacts to see Frank
lol
EARLY LEMME THINK OF A JOKE.ETHAN IN THE 90s
Can we get a full version?
are you fucking pregnant? holy fuck
yay ethan is back!
Neon Cancer
In b4-4.
But in the 90s youtube didnt exist so you wouldnt be able to make a bunch of money making funny videos from home.
The intro finally fits together!!!
Ethan, the type of nigga to rape his wife in the 90's
He actually did it, the absolute madman
For real though, RyanDan from B4-4 have some of the best and powerful vocals out there
Yeeeeessssssssss
holy shit xd
when is this available on itunes?
godlike ethan!
For some reason Ethan's singing voice reminds me of Gorillaz
REEEEKKKKKTTTTTT
I'll jizzcuzzi with you any time
Every video is better than the previous one, but i just noticed now that you were white at first, wow
Israeli carrot? Is that a carrot that plants itself in other peoples gardens claiming it owned the land for thousands of years and gets protected from criticism because some gardeners got tired of their crap a couple decades ago and tried uprooting them from their gardens?

Too soon? Maybe when they stop with all of their illegal activities and human rights violations.
I thought this was about Ethan Bradberry
Good Goof Ethan
Why did the guys on the 90's cover look similar to SoFlo?
Just a tan bro
Normally this type of commitment just to funny is cringy, but ethan has a way of making it enjoyable.
Fucking amazing.
#IsraeliCarrot
Ethan looked like a bronze kettle. A fucking sick 90's band bronze kettle.
I really really appreciate the dedication and effort. They must really love us, Papa Bless.
wow makes me rethink my youth O_O
Ethan and hila, this was fucking beautiful 
ty for the laughs
VAPE NATION <3
Honestly, someone needs to explain H3H3Productions to me..... 

Please? Is it post-ironic?
Ethan steppin it up consistently, holy shit. KEEP IT UP!!
the meme man has died, now the vaporwave guy has born
Each video just gets more bizarre. Let's see how far we can go °v°
Bahahaha holy fuck so many laughs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tbh if Ethan took some vocal lessons he'd be really good
That moment when even Papa Franku (Filthy Frank) thinks you're going too far with an idea and is actually against it.
ethan sounds like young thug
Ethan has clean cut charm of a boy band front man
INB4 skin cancer.
Ethan you drug person, i bet you stole those cloths from your mum. Because that's what drug people do.

Papa Bless.
Ethan's entire life has led up to this moment
hahaha you look like all the guys on jersey shore (but a funny version)
moist
It's time to clip the man bun, Frosted tips are coming back baby!
This episode is so Tim and Eric I love every second of it
You know what else I love from the 90's? Airplane Model Instruction Videos.
ethan just doesnt give a single fuck
Perfect song for the first dances at the weddings
were can i get the hot 90s mixtape
fuck u ethan i do not watch your videos because you are black.
I can't be the only one crying right now. This is just a mixture of lyrical geniusnes and god given vocals. Where can I get the full song? ITunes ? Datpiff? Play store? #VN #1/4B5-5
THE YELLOW ELITES!!!
I was born in the wrong generation.
Excellent video. Great moves Ethan, proud of you!
2:12
I want to ask all the beautiful and smart people of the comment section: why do people get spray tans? Why not a real tan? Or one of those fake tans you get from tanning beds that aren't much better? Is it a skin cancer thing? Are the chemicals from the spray really that much better for your skin?
I love those guys tans. They almost look like The Simpsons irl
That YTV logo holy shit
this is how you can tell Ethan truly does this for the viewers
This was amazing
JUST A TAN BRO! (GONE BRONZE!)
the least I could do is leave a like. what the fuck did I just watch
EY
I really wanted Jon and Frank to end up joining your band near the end. That would have made this collabo next fucking LEVEL. Their dedication to the craft just simply isn't as strong I suppose.
VR goggles? That's a View-Master! Ethan confirmed to not be a 90s kid.
Sad part is Ethan could actually have rocked the Mohawk
5:18 she looks up at the logo like "wtf is this place? "
Gotta love the committment
I thought the faces in the thumbnail were edited...
you alright there buddy?
Your best video ever fuck yeah man.
he's like, hila I'm gonna make you come tonight. She like "ummm. yea right ya goofster"
Only 90's kids would understand.
I was born in 98 and I miss the 90's :(
Hands down the best you tuber of our era. What other you tuber has frosted tips? Ethan:1 YouTube:0
A Israeli Carrot lmao!. "THAT'S BLACK FACE"! I'm so glad I found this channel.
I freaking love when Jontron and Filthy Franc end up in his videos or vice versa haha
Only 90s kids will know
this videos makes me miss Savage Garden so bad
Ethan singing "puka shell necklace tonight" sounds like a super budget adam levine
smoshoyo looks like edward snowdard lol XD
'Why don't you write a Tumblr post about it you fucking PC bitch!'
This is the youtube equivalent of what Leo DiCaprio went through in Revenant to get his oscar. Where's Ethan's?
V/\
You know you've gone too far when filthy frank has to tell you.
You look like guy fierri
still a better movie then Batman v Superman.
Meme detected: You look like an Israeli carrot!
Quality content and the comments arent cancer. I fucking love you Ethan
Mark Hoppus on those end vocals tho
\/ |\|
you need to lose some weight, ethan
00:12 Dhurd I'm trying to eat.
I want to toss you of.... a cliff
Ethan is looking better than ever
I can't believe fucking Jon and Frank turned you down. Shit would have been DOPE.
LOL Ethan is so fucking great!!!😂😂😂
8:37 "You ain't shit, nigga"
Ethan and Hila have the best personalities on YouTube. They are the true Dream Team Meme Fiends.
Remember in the 90 when people had penis now they all pussy OHOHOHO
#BringBackThe90s
Don't approve of the intro
Got to admire the commitment he has for his passion
ETHAN AND HILA I don't even know if you'll read this BUT if you do, know that you guys are some of, if not the best, content creators out there. Thanks for doing this. Pappa bless.
This is depressing.
optic scumpi!!!
My god. This was absolutely incredible. 
BLESS UP
JON!!! MAKE VIDEOS!!
Ethan has strayed from the VAPENATION this is the result..... I cri

That was so fucking good, Papa bless
umm idk what to say... i'm ethan bradberry¡ no? ok
Dude, you are a legend :D
I love this new format of videos! They are definitely worth the wait.
When he said Jone I thought he got Jone sockers
I want to fuck.... The shit outta you
Frank: 'you ain't shit nigga'
I am sad Sean Balogh got expelled from the intro. RIP Mr. with Superaids.
Commitment ladies and gentlemen.
Keeeeek
as a fan of h3h3 my only reaction to this video is

The quality of their videos are just getting better and better

how did the audio get so good
that black kid is getting all the pussy.
i wish i was a 90's kid, this generation sucks!!! i just wanna rock out to b4-4 and 2packs!!1111
This was too cringy even for me.

I mean, did you see that guy he featured for the skype call bit? Ethan, are you really bringing homeless crackheads on to help with your videos? Hard to watch that guy.

Rest of the video made my pussy really hard though, 10/10
Jontron killed me!!! OMG LMAO

Hila's totally on board for this.
Good god, Ethan in public makes me cringe so hard I can't even watch it.
What anime is this?
This is fucking glorious
omg im dying
8:21 WRITE A TUMBLR POST ABOUT IT YOU PC BITCH

Too many meme lords in one video
Ethan Bandberry
When Filthy Frank tells you to get your shit together, you know you're doing something wrong.
ethan=deadpool confirmed
Ethans frosted tips make me hard, idk why.
AND IM ETHAN KLEIN
10:55 wow Ethan great moves Keep it up!

Ethan will die for a solid meme one day.
ETHAN ARE YOU CRAZY?!?!

This is almost like if Tim and Eric had a vlog channel.
Amazing, h3h3 is back!

He looks like Marcus Smart
If papa franku is against it, i'm against it. Disliked.

Papa franku
Holy fuck, I can't believe you actually did that to yourself, lol.
I'm going go and throw up now too much cringe with boy bands.

More shit like this please!!!

Is anyone else worried about Ethan after this video?
How's that fupa loss gwan boi?
Is it bad that I really liked the song
Why does Ethan look like he's tying to sell me a car in a questionable neighbourhood...
"Why don't you write a tumblr post about it"

You guys are getting good at this.
Wow

You've sprayed so much bronze your beard started to resemble scat porn.

HIGHLIGHTER WITH DOWN SYNDROME
Was that Franks real reaction
It seems like now a days all of Ethan's videos are making it on to my favs list, Great work Ethan, poppa bless
Ethan. Ethan,, my sweet, beautiful, naive child. Why didn't you just fucking use bronzing powder. Ethan!! BRONZING POWDER, ETHAN!!!!

im ethan bradberry
I must be the only one who halfway liked Ethan's singing voice? I want an album!
I need to like this multiple times.
IMMA MAKE U CUM TONIGHT (...) OVA TO MY HOUSE... (COME*)
not enough autotune
V/\
im born in the wrong generation
This is Genius!!!!
Oh hey look a bunch of pedophilic men creeping on a little girl
sorry i mean
Oh hey look a bunch of pedophilic women creeping on a little boy
Wait...

Was the music video about fucking a black boy?
I need an entire album. Please make this happen. Collab with pink guy. Give the world what it needs dude.
I missed you man.
Ethan is just a living, breathing meme creator and its fantastic
full song pls
Like a Greek god. I'm dead.
8:40 frank says nigger 😮😮😮😮😮😮😱😱😱😱😨😨😨😨
I wanted this video to never end
There may be other living memes out there, but Ethan is living the meme.
Ethan are you ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ?
Ethan could very well be the next Jimmy Kimmel.
Now I definitely disown you
From 12:15 to 12:32 Ethan sounds like Young Thug XD
The "new" VR goggles are only available in Supply Drops.
should have kept the frosted tip Mohawk for an edgy look, but without the missing section
this wasn't a fucking video, this was a fucking experience
oh oh oh ohhohohoho that is faaaantastic
This made my fucking day
Uhm you are able to see all the skype names. 
I dont think you guys want that.
Hi there H3h3productions here BACK FROM THE DEAD MOTHER RUCKERS
Papa bless
"You look like an Israeli carrot"
VAPE NATION
You know you've gone too far when papa frank calls you weird
When do you become the cringe that you seek to mock? Last video was funnier.
This has to be a fashion trend again in the intro
This is their best video
you may have swag, but you will never have style or class like ethan has
That escalated quickly
Jesus, Ethan
how much did this cost?
that jizz line should have been 'im gonna make you swim in my jizz..cuzzi tonight'
Beautiful
My goal is to live and act like Ethan when I'm old
ROUND OF APPLAUSE 
ROUND
OF
APPLAUSE
IT'S TIME TO STOP!
THIS is YouTube
IM SO HAPPY THIS HAPPENED
Ethan just took it to the next level.
that Toby tumblr reference!!! hahahah
How can one be multiple memes?
I cant wait to see the next Ethan and hila to see what he looks like after this video
Immediately clicked when I saw b4-4 in the thumbnail ahhhh Canadaaaaa
Has ethan gotten fatter
2:20 the chub has been un-tucked
Oompa loompa doompety doo...
anybody know what kind of sunglasses Papa Ethan was wearing in the beginning of the video? Need me some o' them.
Didn't that song come out in the 2000s?
Ethan, I think you might be pregnant ...with twins👶🏼👶🏼
This is perhaps Ethan at his lowest point. And that's saying a lot.
w0w ethan nice moves, i love seeing that f00pa of your's ;) 2:18
Is this a reaction video, or a performance art piece
Okay let me to do tomorrow hahaha. Chick at the tanning place
"VR Goggles" seriously?
i want a behind the scenes video of making this fucking monstrosity
before he got the tan I was like "please papa get a spray tan" this is conclusive proof papa works miracles
Which SteelSeries mouse is that?

Also good video.
making everyone jizz tonight
10-20 years from now "I remember the 2000s"
You can't just go around creating memes like this!
I'd fuck that.
ethan je bent dik
early midlife crisis?
This is God tier.
Where've you been?!
Bronze Nation
ethan looks so hot i just came on my floor
Mid-life crisis summed up in one video
Ethan Fieri
I like this new "sketch" content. Nice diversion from reaction videos. Fuckin funny stuff dude.

Nirvana was the 90s RIP kurt
Best H3H3 episode ever.
perfekteste scheiße aller zeiten! hammer!
this is legendary
Is that SoFlow?????????????????
take me to a coffin cuz i am dying of laughter
ethan you are my spirit animal
5:10 lmfao you look like an old gipsy lady
How long did it take to wash all that shit off?
H3h3 back in full force, you don't need to worry, you're still hilarious
I won't lie, this is definitely me from the 90's 😫😂😂😂😍👌👌💯💯💯
Most 90s boy bands were created so that Lou Perlman could keep harems of good looking young men around him, their success was incidental.
Ethan looks T H I C C
I wish I had this kind of dedication to do my homework and go to school..
jesus christ ethan that was hype dude
Ethan has no shame. he is my spirit animal
This looked expensive
THIS HAPPENED
dude this is a masterpiece!
Anyone else hear franku call Ethan a nigga after calling him racist? xD
This is incredible
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That made me jizzcuzzi
Ethan Bradberry!
THIS is when Ethan became an internet god.
I was born on April 16th, 2016. I'm definitely a 90's kid.
11:48 Sennheiser headphones! Although it's a really cheap pair. You think the guy with all the audio equipment would buy one of the more expensive pairs
I'm gay
@ 3:06
Ethan: "Hila, I'm gonna make you come tonight."
Hila: ".......you are?"
Wow, Ethan! Great moves, keep it up, proud of you!
LOL "You look like an Israeli carrot"
your gay
This is literally my favourite video on YouTube. Great moves Ethan, keep it up.
Jontron's chin strap is fucking horrendous.
Either these videos were made at the same time, or Jontron has been wearing the same outfit for like a week.
I'll get down on you, Ethan.
You should of told me. I would of did it with you d00d.
yoo we have the same jewfro <3
but why
What have you done 😹
I love you Ethan
I'm gonna make you squirt...........tle of my Pokemon collection!
I'm gay
There should definitely be a Vape Nation sequel.
This is the funniest sjiieeet i watch for years your guys best video!
Ethan you make me jizz tonight
wow ethan i cant believe you, and hila too...kids in africa couldve eaten that hair
Isn't that Ethan Bradberry in the boy band?
I'm gonna think of Ethan when i'm in  the tub
That is some impressive commitment. God bless you h3h3.
make it a thing #bringbackthe90's
So this is what you've been doing for 3 weeks. I don't know wether to be amazed, confused, disappointed or just all three...
Ethan dances like a fucking sim
Feels like there hasn't been an upload in forever. Love you. <3
god damn! what a sexy beast
At the end, when the "ay, ay, ay" sound went out of sync i laughed my ass off i dont know why.
Man, I really felt like I levelled up at 13:10
Ethan you're my hero
Walking down the streets of NY like a crazy mother fucker is normal AF.
Since the launch of EthanandHila, and the short break you had away from this channel, the quality of content has really improved.... A LAHT! Great moves Ethan (and Hila), keep it up. Proud of you.
Hawt
You bring your 90's dream to life, Ethan. I believe in you and your jizzcuzziing skills :)
Damn, I would've been into a boyband with Jon in it.
Holy shit! best episode
Ethan will make a video about why he hates lets-players
Ethan klein the album
always worth the wait. keep it up, proud of you.
jizzcuuzin 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i'm gonna make you jizz....... cuzzi tonight
Song starts at        11:48
What sort of shit have you been vaping?
2:24
You dirty Israeli Carrot! >:(
This is beyond great.
Dudez A Plenti used to be my favorite band, but thanks to Ethan he has shown me these greek GODS. B4-4-4EVA
The video was worth the wait, It's funny how a video which only took $40-$100 to make is funnier than every multi-million dollar comedy I've ever seen.

10 Ethan Bradberries out of 10.
Was I the only one who thought that ETHAN BRADBERRY was joining a boyband
\/ - /\/
The things you do to provide entertainment and put food on the table... I applaud you, sir. Good shit.




Papa bless.
Why does ethan want to look like such a weirdo in public?
Ethan, you have react to Dog The Bounty Hunter. Please, if you watch only 5 minutes of his show you will understand that Dog is a new breed of meme.
the album came out on the tear 2000 so therefore he's wrong
you uploaded what a surprise
I miss the 90s #VapeNation
"Bronze means third place" Fucking lul
Bring the VAPE 90'S BACK! \//\
Sick Jew-frow
What the fuck, that was gay. How did they not think that before it was released?
jesus fucking christ ethan
Get fit
"I'm early" comments are cancer. 90's will hunt the world forever...
That's exactly what i wore, in the 90s..
Never go full re- I mean 90s
BEST H3 VIDEO EVERRRRRR LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
Please make a video of you shedding off your skin. Pealing the orange, if you will.
Donald Klein-Fieri
This is like looking at the avengers, all my heroes in one video.
Alright, it's hila's turn now
13:21 #VAPE90'S
This gives me an always sunny in Philadelphia vibe
Stop mocking my favorite song!!!!
Please upload more frequently.
Well that escalated quickly
4:55 ohh shit
THE BOY BAND RANT
I always lose it when frank says nigga
This video wasn't as good as the last one. Still funny though!
thumbs up just for the effort of the video!
Ethan: so is that a no. John: yea I'll think about but probably it's a no... 2 seconds later. Its a no 😂😂😂😂
This is fucking halarious nice work Ethan  \//\
Its just a tan bro!
This was beautiful
chin
Dood.
That song is god damn catchy!
#jews4jesus
i am going to need you to drop that single
Great work!
Hahaha.Thank you Ethan !That was brilliant.
dude definitely low key said "you aint shit nigga" @ 8:38
YAYA THEIR BACK! :D
Jesus Christ..
I'm too drunk to really appreciate this beautiful video
I think you are going too far.
I have those yellow socks lmao
U know ur low, when Papa franku says you've gone too far
I'm gonna make you cum tonight...... Over to my house, of course. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
wow, youve put yerself in a precarious situation, reduced to critiquing the past over the present
i can't tell if it is the fake tan or if you just have a massive head
Your intro is confusing
HOW CAN I LOVE YOU ANY MORE!?
I almost feel like we are back to crunching and lubing. MAke h3h3 great again!
nice moves
I think the last 5 seconds just says it all doesn't it
\/ /\
2:19 is the best thing ever
He was close to supporting pedophilia. lol
Is this what being old is like? Oh God I'm not ready.
Let's be honest, Ethan couldn't even make tomorrow come.
"egg whites"
It's the king of the trap ETHAN BRADBERRY
Ethan Bradberry?
That tan though, so hawt you seem like u came out straight from the 90 brah.
Hell yeah
SWAG
Nice doritos tan
8:25 "Why don't you write a tumblr post about it you PC bitch" LOL
What anime is this
Great bronze complexion Ethan, keep up the great spray tans
B4-4 isn't a 90s band tho.
They're called b4-4 but there's 3 of them...
i heard a bit of the ole tim heidicker in that vid
They just are getting better and better!
what even was this. brilliant ahah.
The dedication to the video is REAL. Appreciate ya COUGH
the quality of these videos so outweighs the wait. so glad he doesn't just pump out shit. although that would be pretty hot!!!
lol xD
Hila's coming tonight guys!!
This may be the weirdest video you've made yet.
Dying with laughter, best one yet
I want the 90s back this generation is so fucked up, I can never find any vr goggles in trash cans anymore #90's kids will know
Nice Rice
Serious comment no hate: is he ok?? He didnt look ok lol gg
pretty fuckin sure this is one of the best videos you and Hila have done on H3H3, great work doods.
why don't you write a tumblr post about it you PC BYETCH
Not gonna lie, this was definitely me in the 90s.
i am going to beat up my dog.
Can't find the original video, now I can't jerk off
Swaaaaaaaag!
holy shit, you guys are steping up the game! much love, papa bless
I'm gonna make you squirt tonight...........  That's it
I love you
This is amazing. I can't believe you actually went through with the tanning xD
Ended on the VAPE NATION!
Ethan Great Job!
When does your album come out?
\//\
It's jersey shaw.
the battle scar at 4:20
That ytv logo tho
Oh my god this is cancer
anyone wanna jizz. cuzzy tonight?  lolololol. can't stop laughing
rip in not alive
lol this episode was dank gj ethan need more like this
the end song is like the jubilant sound of a million triangles
\/ /\
Do a reaction to Jacob saratogious
Ethan has the body of a stereotypical Italian mobster and the face and manners of a dude with Down syndrome.
Dont you get it? The kid in the music video is Patrice Wilson!
That was transcendent
i have a theory that ethan has a multiple personality disorder and creates these characters to cope with his crippling depression. he has his vape man to cope with his addiction, this new frosted tip ethan to cope with his lust and sex addiction, and the broccoli gamer to cope with his addiction to technology and videogames. someone elaborate on this more for me
You need to do a video with Ethan brad berry. He lives in NY too!
That nose pick 😷 4:03
I see why he moved to New York. He wanted to live in a city where he could do loads of stuff that makes him look like an escaped asylum inmate and where nobody on the street gives a shit.
Im gonna make jizz......cuzzi with me tonight! 
......
Making you jizz tonight !
PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE AN EXTENDED TRACK OF YOUR 90s SONG
Man, you need to get those eyebrows bleached but A+ for effort
Did Papa say nigga?
where's the bunch
Oh my god
parody boy band album please
ethan please
I was born in the wrong generation, I miss the 1940's when Anne Frank was bae.
i just love the lack of shame
Haven't laughed this hard in a long time.  Keep up the videos
Yes finally a new video!
I'm gonna have Ethan's song played at my funeral...
is this a season finale?
I can't believe I waited 4 weeks for this shit. Get it together Ethan.
Can't wait to be an adult and do dumb shit like this
Props, this is what i call dedication.
New ringtone. New song for funeral
I would buy an entire album of this... jus sayin
Only true 90s kids get this
how do you feel about yourself... when you do this... ethan?
anyone have a youtuber they'd like to recommend to me to watch ?
Ethan, you're killing me.
You need to wear your pockets inside out!! The Pock n Rock!
that was hot
How do you have the courage to dress and do that stuff in public xD
Ethan congrats! You played yourself.
Ur dedication makes me horny
hes turning into one of those pranks channels just pissing people off in public
DID THE TANNING WOMAN JUST PICK AND FLICK? 

Real Humans of New York.
The dedication to making fun of the "meme" is real
I thought one of them was Ethan Bradberry lmao
"That is black face that is racist Ethan"
"Hila, I'm gonna make you come tonight""You are?"
Goals!
What
They are clones
RNS
Ethan, you have been the king of memes for quite some time. You have created memes and destroyed memes. I think I speak for everyone when I say that I am truly inspired by the dedication that you haven made to meme culture. You will go down in history and we will never forget you! LONG LIVE H3 \//\
so gud
I'd hit that
Hahahahaha dude so gs
Frank's the only white person I'm fine with saying nigga
Are you ok Ethan ? you look like you're in depression … 
Take holidays and go see ur friends and family, it helps ;)
what did he end up doing with the 10 million?
you look like dj Khalid
Ethan LIVES the meme!
Do stupid shit n earn only $10mil
He said vr goggles
Jon's looking really good, his face is so thin.
You look like an Israeli carrot
U guys know when Ethan walked around the corner with the yellow pants the black guy was probably the kid. Illuminati confirmed
i would tap that
I swear this Channel was the greatest Blessing in my life!  Papa bless  Ethan, that Song really made me wanna cum...over to your house ;D
Lmao
All I can think of when I see that shirt is "Don't mess with Tommy."
RESPEK !
H3H3 is the best YouTuber out there with GradeAUnderA!!!
This is a fucking masterpiece 
It was like watching citizen kane being filtered through a pair of view masters
9:19 you can see dJ Khaled. WTF
beeing a slut for utube money lol ." what has the world come to
CHANGING THE GAME
STRAIGHT UP ELEVATED
You know you've done it when fuckin Filthy Frank says you've taken it too far
You are fucking killing it right now dude.
I don't know man. I think you need more bronzer, it's not quite at the level it should've been.
yellow tank top dude looks a little too much like soflo for me
you look like a brazilian tranny with beard
I haven't laughed so hard in a while. This is hilarious
Notification SQUACCKKK
he looks like a gay convict
I wish I could find some binoculars in the trash so some bronze dudes with frosted tips would fuck me.
YOU NEED V A P O R W A V E
A video with Jontron and Filthy frank is always a good video ;D
You should collaborate with Moe and ETHANBRADBERRY. A couple of Bradberry's ft. the Israeli carrot.
This is why I love Ethan. The work he puts into his videos to make his fans laugh is amazing
Damn
I wish my generation could appreciate this kind of music.
God the clean up must of been a nightmare
Ethan is a FUCKING GOD
Ethan you've been stepping up your meme game so hard my power tracker cant keep up. i love you ethan

omg that video you're watching was recorded off YTV... oh the canadian childhood memories XD
Ethan's like the Deadpool of YouTube. Completely irrelevant to what everybody else is doing, but still in the same universe.
Does anyone know where Jon got his hoodie? Or where I could find one kind of like it?
So there band is actually 3
Ethan is obviously on gear.
That sound was released in 2000 so not the 90's lol but I'm just going to let Ethan do his thing.
only 90's kids will remember that intro
Was this filmed on the same day as JonTron's the Blizzard Rant beacuase I think JOn is wearing the same clothes in both videos?
Get (held) down.
Glad to see this channel isn't dead
mikel jakson bess
CHIN
H3h3 back at it again with the 90s
you have done it.
Ethan, holy shit
damn he took the suggestion
this made me laugh so hard. thanks
damn he took the suggestion
the only logical progression is to get this to number one to fuck with society
Tfw your brother is watching Hey, Arnold downstairs.
Seeing JohnTron, PapaFranku and MemeLord all in one video literally feels like the avengers of youtube
This video wasn't that great
i have checked the channel for a new video everyday for the last 3 weeks now. thank you papa. i have been blessed.

vintage h3h3 great job Ethan proud of you
TAN NATION YALL !
I love Ethan. He's not afraid to do anything.
I miss hey arnold :(
The first guy looked like Ethan in his prime. I think he's just really sad that he's not apart of the group anymore.
It's just a tan bro.
top tier shtuff man
"2016 socks!"
Please put this on itunes
"2016 socks!"
i am just so confused
Ethan why are you sweating so much 😂
So from a pure un-memed-virgin's point of view. This basically means to.. ejaculate on a sleeping pregnant Snoop Dogg tonight? No..? Can someone please explain?
crazy good
I masturbate to all your jizzcuzzis
Papa's back
The jaundice line made me laugh so hard
This channel is what I live for. I really appreciate the shit you do for our entertainment hahahahhaa

Ethan Bronzeberry
Blonde boys, RIP cyndago

You sing like Adam Levine
"no one's going down on me" common Hila what you been doin girl?
You took it up a notch with this and I have never felt so good about cringing to the max. papa bless.
It has been a few years since I actually laughed at a YouTube video hahaha holy fuck Ethan, great moves indeed
I wont lie, this is definitely me when I miss the 90s
The funny part is Ethan's look is actually better than the chinstrap bowl cut John dude
Bronze tan? Blonde hair?
My god, h3h3 turned into Trump
Filthy Frank being the voice of reason XD
Dat YTV pop-up for added Canadian nostalgia
johns neckbeard though
best h3 video, so  good
Ethan get your shit together
Where can i download this song? Is it on iTunes yet?
the things you do for a video ethan, keep it up, proud of you!
Franks cap and glasses. Perfect bois exist.
8:40. so much for political correctness. lmao.
That was beautiful
Does this mean no more \//\??? 😢
R.I.P. #Vapenaysh
He  has  a  similar  singing  style  to  Jimmy  Buffett! Make an album!
It's blackface lol
is see you been playing the csgo h3
SO EARLY OOH YEAA
The kid turns out to be Patrice Wilson! Lol.
You keep implying that these guys somehow determined or were a typical example of 90's fashion, which isn't true.  The 90's were the least lame of recent decades, including this one. That is why you rarely see someone make fun of them. People were on top of their game in terms of fashion and public behavior. As opposed to 80's hair styles, 2000's emo and 2010's offended crowds.
0 fucks given about society
i eat ass
Am i the only person shocked at how good Ethan can sing hahaha
Got damn, this was hilarious. Dankkyawww
I don't know why but that moment when Ethen looks into the mirror is kinda sad because it's like he's looking and he no longer sees the h3 that he used to know but instead this manifested gag/goof that's taken over
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO YOURSELF?! ARE YOU CRAZY?!
He forgot h3h3 reaction video.
Ethan, that was amazing.
well ethan does already have frosted tips ;)
we 90's. hit like on the video f you're a 90's kid. only 90's kids will get this bomb ass meme
WOW just fucking WOOOOOOW this must be my favorite one and i have watched all of them multiple times xD Love you guys keep up the dope ass work!
I just started watching you yesterday and I have almost seen all of you videos. You the funniest YouTube next to frank. Keep it up man
oficially ethan made it into the another level, keep it up, proud of ya
Seriously, how could you allow this Hila? Bad moves
Ethan. I love you. But you're a fucking mess dueee
the amount of balls Ethan has...
best h3h3 video ever
this was released in 2000 papa
When there is no resolution to the adventure.
Nice job. You dress like a retard every video and get views for some reason.
vape memes never die
Ethan,  I want you to make me come to your house tonight.
This is amazing, Ethan really committed to his dream of being in a boy band - such sacrifice!
This is your masterpiece.
DJ Khaled Hitchcock cameo at 9:17
Hands down best YouTuber 😂😂
That was amazing
Ethan..... What the fuck
Legendary.
Can we just have a moment of silence right now for every time Ethan has ruined his body and hair just to entertain us? Ethan, you da real MVP.
i totally get these references born in 1999 #90'skid
where did you by the shorts?
Damn, Ethan got so much ass
Only REAL 90's kids would get this video....
CRINGIEST BOYBAND ON YOUTUBE
I'm gonna make you squirt...... your water pistol.
I will take you places that you only think about when you're asleep at night ..♡♡♡♡
Niceeee
2:17 I kind of knew it was coming eventually but it caught me off guard and made me burst out laughing 😂😂😂
ya hair's lookin nice, bb
I have just put my signed copy on ebay for $420,  50% of proceeds go to  Vape Nation.
this video has a really deep meaning but I can't seem to find it out.. hmmm
I can't wait to see the art people make for this
and they did it again... these guys are the best youtubers there are. so glad i found their channel when I did.
Ethan is literally the love child of Tim & Eric
Vn
h3h3 productions has set the bar for how far someone will go to some a joke. GG everybody!
what was that lady shoving something up her nose or something?
Could we get an Ethan Bradberry
Keep up the hustle
Is that Ethan singing at the end? It actually doesn't sound bad...
It's 1893 again baby!!
VΛ
So you are alive?
I died at 4:09
I'm gonna make you jizz
.
.
.

Did anyone notice the scar on his upper back?

Jon!
"u look like a highlight of downsyndrome" bruh noo 😂
Come on, Ethan. The 80s was better
A NEW H3H3 VIDEO? HELL YEAH DUDE
Hahahaha, thats dedication
Punished Ethan-
A Hero Denied By His Homeland
This was a great video. H3h3 yeet yeet
Did you come back from Israel with a Jewfro? Do they force you to grow one or something?
Yeeees
Ethan gives no fucks about what he does and who he is. I can see why Hila married Ethan.
more comedy skits -  less commenting on videos, dude
When Papa Franku showed up I couldn't stop laughing
when he started dancing i died 😂😂😂
"you look like a highlighter with downsyndrome"
All I miss from the 90's is the candy.
When you said I'm gonna make you jizz you should've played a moan in the backround
Great, you made me hate the 90's.
\/ /\/.
ayy
Is this a sequel to Jack and Jill?
The best part is he actually cut his hair, dyed it, and got a spray tan for this video.
oh my goodness Ethan.
Ethan's descent towards insanity his videos just keep getting more wild, edgy, and rogue
Ethan really committed to the bit this time hahahahaha
i love you.
You look really good in pink, Ethan. Great job. Keep it up!
you look like kid fury
#jizzcuzzi
"Get Down" was release in the yarr 2000, but like...I get ya!
they're so tanned they look like fuckin donald trump
Look like a caramel donut
Wow Ethan, great moves! Keep it up, proud of ya!
Fucking fantastic!haha
absolutely amaizing pls explore more intersting and funny cultures
ethan looked like a burnt sweet potato
When frank came on screen.... oh baby a triple
lmao ethan ain't scared of doing anything embarrassing in public xD
I'd join your boy band Ethan, let's bring the 90's back baby!
They were talking to the kid at the start, that's uncomfortable.
Ethan... This was hard to watch.
Holy fucking shit Ethan.Those are some great moves
I admire Ethan's dedication to follow his dream, it's quite moving. :')
what a legend...
I hope to god Ethan doesn't get skin cancer.
I'll join your boy band Ethan.
the 90's really were the best
I feel so sorry for Hila
h3 i think you may of had given me canncer
you truly are a god
V/\
how can you walk in public looking like that xd
Wah to dank
oh my papa, Ethan, Hila, you fucking did it. You made my most favorite video ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You look great
V/\
Ethan. You have such a nice butt.
Ethan you really out did yourself with this one. Good job Dood, you was really rocking those frosted tips.
When are we gonna get a sexy Ethan Klein 12 month calendar?
Jesus fucking criest
Frank doesnt have a beard wtf
12:46
LOL
Is that Morpheus behind Ethan at 9:30?!?!??!
An h3h3 skit about Kpop would be funny. Maybe a part two to this video; Ethan joins a Kpop boy group!
B44 can be translated to "Before four" the number before four in numbers is three. There are three members of B44, there are three sides in a triangle. Four triangles in a pyramid, the pyramid of snofru wasn't available for the public until 96' the year when b44 met. These are just a series of random facts and lead to no particular conclusion.
got major cringe at the song
From the Vape Nation meme to the 90s boy band meme... this is some next level shit right here!
i have no problem joining your band
Get Down came out in 2003 mate, sorry to break the bad news.
#TanNation
Wow Ethan great boobs, proud of you.
Now that's commitment
How old is Ethan?
Fucking fantastic 👌
TRY TO STOP ME FROM BRONZING
Such
Dedication
did anyone else have this terrifying thing where when ethan was dancing, his head looked superimposed onto his body because of the bronzing on his face?
This is just brilliant.
Why does Ethan drag his channel down by featuring this Filthy frank guy?
Am I the only one concerned for Ethan's health
papas on your side
if only Sean were here
Well B4-4 just got a lot of people who now know who they are. They should thank Ethan; haha.
I've bee rewatching 2:13 for the past hour and I feel like I'm really close to achieving spiritual enlightenment.
This man has nothing to lose.
is that a non mechanical keyboard

"You look like an Israeli carrot."
                 -Jon Jafari, 2016
Ethan going full DJ Khaled lol
"Thanks for the popularity bump, Ethan!"

- 90s Canadian Content Laws
perfect
"I'm just dancing this isn't about you"
I feel like calling it thinly veiled is an over exaggeration, it's not even that, they do everything short of saying the words I want to have sex with you.
this video is RADtastic!
I... i don't know how i feel right now after watching this
Ethan had like 40 years on the 90's
great video ethan! see you again in a month! :D
The world watched and waited to see what the follow-up to VapeNation could possibly be.

This is fuckin brilliant and well worth the wait <3
Wrf
Finally
Why is Jon still wearing the same fucking clothes from his blizzard rant like 5 days ago?
This might just be the best song I've ever heard my entire life....
Those boys sound like they REALLY did it for the nookie
Baby come on over and show me your ass... tronomy books
Gonna cover your mouth while I insert my.... opinion

Nice video Ethan proud of you
So much work just for the fans. H3H3 is the greatest
Ethan looks like a Palestinian
"you're takin it too far" ~ Filthy Frank, the guy who fed dead mice he found on the street to a midget
12:45B45
Are they talking to the black kid? cause he picks up those glasses and they're looking directly at him...
2:22 ethan don't be ashamed. you don't need to pull your shirt down. let your fupa shine.

holy fuck ethan youre gonna look black for a long as time now
i thought i unsubbed from you a while back... wtf glitch...redo
ohh baby taking youtube to a whole new level my nigga shiet!
What makes this video so great. h3h3 is not afraid to go out in public looking how he looks, FithyFrank and h3h3 know how to improv on the spot, the appearance of JonTron, the song by Schmoyoho, and h3h3 taking the time and effort to make the video as hilarious as possible. That's quality content.
OMG !
 ITS JONTRON! :p
And PapuFrank! :P
Did you double check to make sure none of these guys had any mental retardation or illness? I better not find out one of these dudes suffers from depression because if I do there is a very scathing rant coming your way.
4:20
Where you got that cut from? The camps you fucking Jew?
ohhhhhhhh give Ethan a Grammy!!!!!!! Papa Bless music 90's Lord!!!!!!!!!!
4:01 that boog pick
IT'S FITNESS DUDE. IT'S FITNESS>

Great Moves Ethan 🙅🏾💁🏾
at 11:30 ethans head looks like it is photoshopped to his body
You gotta real nice ass, Ethan.
Ethan has turned into a Oompa Loompa looking Joaquin Phoenix motherfucker. 

Never change Ethan. Never change.
I have never been so pumped over a spray tan in my life
Hahaha, this is fantastic! Also thanks for unintentionally releasing this on my 30th birthday, what a great end to the day!
The cringiest decade ever... I'm fine with being born in 2000. GameCube master race
glad you dont forget this channel ethan, lol
V/\
saw this on the reddit post before he made a video on it so i am a hipster therefore better than all of you
A work of genius dude, Papa John/10.
When Get Down by B4-4 actually came out in May 2000 so this whole video is a pack of lies :(
keep it bronze. keep it 90's. papa bless
You just look like a homosexual ethan.
Papa bless you sexy motherfucker.
This was worth a month of no videos :)
bad moves Ethan, bad moves
5:11 what a sight
Ethan is so sexy in those 90s clothes
HAHAHAHA
When you listening to that new new Kanye joint but daddy Ethan uploads
he looks like riff raff jody highroller
Fact: They used to play this video all the time on a Canadian TV network that was geared towards kids (YTV)
Put this on itunes im sure a bunch of people would buy it. Ik i would
Ethan sexy af
I died when he looked at the picture for the longest time and said "could be darker"
he transcended to god of cringe
The dedication of this man is unbelievable. Or craziness I dont know
ethan doesnt give a single fuck lol
oh my god ethan what did you dooooooo
tan ethan looks like Russell wilson o:
Jesus Christ
I am not going to lie, Ethan looks younger in those cloths.
You look like Spagett's gay Italian brother
This was so worth the wait, papa bless.
IMETHANKLEIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Look at this niggerfaggot
I'm gonna make you cum fortable tonight
this video is literally just ethan having a midlife existential crisis
Wtaf Ethan
quality content
The amount of dedication you guys have is super impressive keep up the good work.
fapping intensifies
I remember the 90s as baggy jeans and flannel jackets.
In japan they want to be whiter rather than darker which is probably why frank was against it. That or the fact that you look like a spoiling grapefruit.
That kinda made you look like Patrice Wilson... not physically but more like the derange, insane Patrice.
only 90's kids will remember ;)
It's Just a tan bro
I'm gonna make you JIZZZZZZZZZZZZZ..............CUZZIII tonight....
Ethan , that was one huge mistake..
I don't like this video. It's kind of garbage unlike mines.
This is the internet comedy version of the Avengers
20's will remember HOW FUCK UP WE ARE
This is the greatest fuckng shit
this is just the best thing ever.
I think I nut.
jesus christ
i love how Jon, and Frank are in the same video but never encounter.
Great work I love your videos!
VapeNation BRING BACK THE 90S VapeNation
Ethan joins Jersey Shore... and is then kicked off to go live on the streets and persues his music career
Filthy frank said nigga
One of the funniest videos I've ever had the pleasure to witness
WOW ETHAN GREAT SOCKS
Lol 13:11 he looked like venom snake from mgs5
i love you
Best video ethan and hila have made ahahah
Fupa slip at 2:21

 your welcome and enjoy
God I love that cough
90's kid will remember...
Ethan has them moves though.
Political Correctness will be an embarrassing fad that we'll all look back on in the next few decades as well.
This is absolute gold! Nice moves!
What in the world happened to the original intro song? I don't like this new *eyebrow twitch* jam... It ain't cool, it ain't smart, and it ain't loyal! Dammit, Ethan *cough* I want the old one.
What the heck? Do all my favorite you tubers live in the same apartment or something?!
11:10 Ethan looks like an old guido transgender granny.
Ethan is lowkey a good singer
¨
Fucking incredible
I CANT BREATHE OH MY GOD GUCK
ethan looks like the mother of one of the boy band members
People who say they're 90's kid who are born in 1999 should just end themselves
haha worth the wait
A rare miss from h3h3
I BET ONE FUCKED UP DENTIST WOULD JOIN YOUR BAND.
2:18
The Fupa Load
EH.
Almost a month. triumphant return, ethan. maybe your magnum opas.
Dank
This video reminds of those 90s kids that act like narcissistic assholes they have been bragging for 6 years now.
8:25   When you hear a feminist talking.
"You look like a highlighter with down syndrome."
This is my favourite video
JonTron
Taking it way too far lmao
funny thing about those b4-4 guys is that they and their song are 2000s, not 90s xD
do you pronounce the "h" in "Hila"?
His hair looked like a block of ramen
4:04 sje pickin her nose
to be honest this was very cringy , trying really hard to be funny
the schmoyoho's song saved the sketch tho
FINALLY!!!
At certain points in this video it seems like ethan is seriously contemplating his existence wondering if doing all this shit for views is worth it and what has gone wrong with his life, and hilla just slaps him in the back saying "you smart"
Tupac would have been proud
I was so disappointed he wasn't combining the bunch and roll with the chub and tuck.
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING TO YOURSELF BRADBERRY???
The amount of youtuber appearances in this video was ......3...........what?did you think I was gonna over exaggerate?
lmfao
Finally another video
at 2:18 I got a half erection. Not one of the proudest moments of my life.
the song he made actually kinda sounds like a gorillaz song lol
100k views in 50 mins. proud of you ethan
you went fuckin ham brah... whole new level of respect.
Greek God
Papa Franku
guess ethans Brain finally snapped. It was all the vaping you done did fucked you up dude.
Just me or does he sound like Randy Newman when he sings?
Oh and try to collab with a dude name Casey Neistat
freakazoid: ITS TIME FOR A TAAAAN BRO ETHAN
8:40 - "you aint shit nigga" lol
Took a while to make a H3 video, but this took a lot of effort into your creativity. Wow Ethan Great moves Proud of you Keep it up!
My sister has those shorts. :|
Has Ethan gone too far? Yeah...
DAMN ETHAN
(clapping)
Ethan tell that nigga Jon to upload some more game reviews or something lmao
Ethan are you okay? is everything okay? wtf man
Ethan I'm actually worried for, if filthy frank said it's too much then there's a problem.
Is this song on iTunes?
I love your content and I appreciate the time you put into your videos
Great video keep it up proud of u
Noo why are they singing that basically to a little kid whaaaat
The dream of the nineties is alive in Portland
Dude you should become a broccoli assassin
woo hoo
Best channel on Youtube. Hands down.
This taught me to set my spirit free.
You're taking the meme-making too far
Are we just going to ignore the woman picking her nose at 4:02 ?
A new h3h3productions video? LETS PEEP THIS OUT!
I'd like to think that your use of the I–V–vi–IV chord progression was an intentional choice to make this song as 90's and cliche as possible.
The Hips don't lie 😂😂😂
Canadian tresure, B44, because theres 3... 3 is before (b4) 4..its fucking eh
VAPENATION 2.0 PLEASE
"If you go down on me, I'll go down on you
play with your tight puckered asshole, like you want me to"
In a world of universal compliance , ignoring the trend is a revolutionary act.
frosted tips alert
I can't believe you got Junkie Einstein himself to appear on your show and for such a short bit!!!! A great episode but if you utilized your co-star's amazing talents more this video could have made you immortal! I love you guys both so much, but AutotuneTheNews was the SHITS before you were on the scene, Ethan. Oh and gotta give LOVE TO HILA!! Girl you are fantastic too, what a great pair you make. I will wait forever for another H3H3 video which are the vids that introduced you guys to me and I love them too, if you just keep making those Ethan and Hila vids. You both smart, you both a genius. I know you can handle success!

Long Story Short: Love you to bits, more Gregory next time.
One of the best videos so far. Keep it up, proud of ya and papa bless.
HOLLY FUCK I HAVE THE SAME SHORTS !
Fucking great job with this - worth the wait, Ethan and Hila.
 - Bear approves.
I left a like because I can relate to this
Ethan, you actually don't look half as bad! Love the new style!
This is commitment to the art
The intro just doesn't feel right with out the normal song :(
05:54 he looks like a poodle
This is going too far. Keep it up
Man I just want too smack your ass around :^)
Hahahha
He probably got cancer from all that bronzer
This is officially the greatest video ever made.
Holy shit
That tan was on fleek

8:00 It's just a tan, bro!
H3H3 reacts
Everything for that sweet, juicy, cheeky, YT revenue xd
a gas getting jewed 4:08
Omfg I hate filthy frank
As soon as I saw him consulting with the tan clerks I was like ETHAN NOOO DON'T DO IT. The things this man does for goofs and gafs...
Stay gold pony boy.
too dank
And I thought my gut was bad...
Vaping, not even ONCE
He started to almost look like DJ Khaled in those last close up shots.
Ethan look like a Burnt chicken nugget
This is what commitment means.
#BronzeNation
Bro you are actually getting some fupa, consider a diet or something (not trying to sound rude)
and to think YTV was a kids channel
that's not VR faggot it's clearly a viewfinder
8:35 he says the N word
I may have contracted some sort of disease from watching this video lol keep up the great work you're crazy
This was well JENK!
Ethan, thank you for providing me with that wonderful tanning footage. Im gonna have fapping material for the next year! WOOHOO
Going extreme
Low key looked good at 5:50
No fucking way Ethan with that tan and hair. Fuck off mate this is too good.

You hanged out with Filthy Frank too much, it's clear now you got cancer, it can only grow now

Keep it up, proud of you

OMG That intro was magical
its so bad what happened to his amazing react videos
did ethan get shanked in the back?
I don't know if any of you watch Northernlion but I've seen this video cause of a long rant from one of his Isaac videos. God it's as awful as he made it out to be.
VAPE NATION
I'm always amazed at how far you're willing to go for this channel, papa bless
Nice ass Ethan.
Ayyy ma boi Jon in dis bitch
4:02 Such professionalism, she just picks one out right in front of you. That really just says how little she thinks of you wearing that neon pink shirt with shorts that go above your belly button.
Everyone who has lived in the 90s knows that the fashion sucked and the music was generic.
DAMMIT ETHAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE I LOVE IT
You've done it, Ethan.
You've oficially hit Tim & Eric levels of uncomfortable.
jizzcuzzi...so sexy.
I dropped a hot load



Of laundry when I watched this.
Why is this the best thing ever.
So is does this mean that Ethan is going through a midlife crisis?
this is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
Was that "why dont you write a fucking tumblr post about it" an April Eff Reference?
the 80s rule.go h3h3.
I just realized that most of my favourite people are Jews. They are clearly controlling the media.
Give me a blow job--


At the barbershop
He's taking us to flavor town!!!
Who's mans is this? 😂😂😭😭😭
Ethan, you're looking fabulouuus!
Next time I see some weird guy with horrible fashion sense running down the streets of New York like a psychopathy, I know who's to blame.
the standard of epic video has just transended to another dimension
And that's how you get skin cancer, kids.
ethan is a fucking meme addict
you can pinpoint the exact moment he breaks on the inside
great video, keep it up, proud of you
this is on another level!
LIKE = LIKE
SUB = SUB
IGNORE = RAPE
When papa franku tells you to you've gone too far... You've gone too far.
Was it worth?
I love how your face looks photoshopped while you dance hahaha :'))

4:01 she never thought millions of people were about to see that
This dedication to art really inspires me.
0:15 DAT ASS DOE
New Meme Idea: 1. Say something sexually suggestive
2.Pause
3. Follow up with "Over at my house"
Anything for views
Still looks better than the 13 year old comb over that John guy has
"you aint shit n***a" - FlithyFrank 2016
I think Ethan has taken it to the next level with this vid
I wonder what the people who repeatedly see Ethan out in public like this think about him by now.
Prob my favourite H3H3 video....its just so...perfect
Papa Bless

Hate to say this to you Ethan but that music video is from 2003.

Hey Ethan and Hila why don't you post on H3H3 anymo... oh wait wrong channel 😛

9:08 Ethan's  bulge °∆° super hot
The sound behind your lyrics was funnily enough fucking awesome and with real lyrics would be bomb
'This whole YouTube this is great but you're taking it way too far' - Filthy Frank, that man who will eat cake made of vomit, set of fireworks directly under his crotch, and run around in public dressed in a full-body pink latex suit for views on YouTube
Too many good gifs will come from this video. Great moves, keep it up.
Thats a beautifull 90's Chub 'n Tuck, best video to watch before going to bed.
SEXY AF
"You're taking it way too far"

-Papa Franku who ate hair cake

Jesus Christ this was amazing

Ethan makes any style look normal on him, fucking jokes.
1999 Master Race!
my mom came into my room when the dancing part came on and was just confused. said that you basically summarize New York
This was seriously a little too amazing for me to handle.
They are going to kick him out of nyc
8:37 Filthy Frank said nigger
not even joking. when i saw the title and the thumbnail I thought the video would be about one of the guys looking like ethan bradberry. didn't even associate ethan with ethan klein
bronze means 3rd place xD
Inb4 b4-4

Ethan brad berry
Last time i was this early my tips were frosted af
Those boy band members look like if Tidus multiplied himself and made his own group.
I remember thenorthanlion referencing this song in his Issac lp. I didn't know what song it was until now
Ethan's hair actually looks good with the Odelll Beckham dye
Thought it was a VR vid in the beginning with all the camera movement in the beginning!
He waited for all the heat to go off before posting the video. Smart move Ethan, smart move...
"Anything for views"
SOMEONE PLEASE REMIX THIS SONG
drugs.wmv
Those frosted tips? Now thats a 10.
DJ KALED? 9:17
Who are those youtuber

Only 90s Kids™ will get this!!1!1!!!
Ethan, I lived in the 90s
I knew the 90s
90s were a friend of mine
Ethan, you're no 90s
beef orf war
i have a huge crush for ethan and after seeing videos like these i get a huge boner... goddamn, ethan, i can't hold it no longer, i need your dick inside me
I think Ethan was just born in the wrong generation ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
damn Ethan is a good singer. I'll join the jacuzzi tonight

Towards the end Ethan looked like a child from Toddlers and Tiaras...
Holy shit... B4-4 are Canadians.
Yep I'm gonna trib myself to death
YEAH
ONLY 90s KIDS WILL REMEMBER THE APARTHEID
I wish that h3h3 fans could say something besides parroting every line Ethan has ever said. The comment section is pure cringe. If I was Ethan, I would be pretty discouraged every time I looked at the comments and realized that half the people in the community are retards with no identity of their own.
Those glasses are so sick where did you get them?
I'm not gonna lie, this was definitely me in the 90's
Thank you you beautiful Jewish bastard
DAMN EAT SOME BREAD BARRY
Legend has it that instead of being executed, Ted Bundy escaped to Israel. Years later he flew back to America and settled down in New York. He has gained weight and gotten some plastic surgery, but his personality - insane, disturbing, egotistical, and unfit for YouTube - had remained the same. If you see this man, let the police know immediately.
It's so beautiful
Honestly it blows my mind how much work you guys put into your videos it is truly unique. So funny too. Deserve so much props , keep it up proud of ya.
hahaha
He needed a disguise so the people he vaped at wouldn't recognize him.
JONTRON ❤❤❤❤
That second dude is literally Akuma...
10/10 song
your cringe asf bro 😂😂😂😂😂
See you in 3 weeks guys!
oh my lord that hair
3:46 what is that bitch playing fucking charades?
Do all Jon's friends release one video per year
The dude looks like Soflo
HAVE YOU EVER FARTED BUT WERE SURPRISED AND HORRIFIED TO DISCOVER THAT IT WAS A WET ONE?  I MEAN THAT YOU HAD JUST BLOWN OUT A WAD OF MUCUSY DIARRHEA?

I HAVE SHIT MARKS IN MY UNDERWEAR.

WHAT ABOUT YOU GUYS?
Ethan for real this video is fucking amazing. The amount of shit you did to make this funny as fuck video just makes it even better! God bless, love your videos like crazy.

WTF?
Did this song feel oddly familiar to anyone else until 3:01 and then suddenly remembered Northernlion doing a lyrical break down of this vid specifically focusing on that part in the song?
Oh shit, Canada 90s kid nostalgia. That shit was cringeworthy even back then. Ethan legit looks like their older, fatter brother.
Please we need a full version of that song it was dope as fuuuuuck
jizz-cuzzi lol

I remember northern lion talking about this song on one of his videos. Never actually looked it up though
this is a reaction video
"You look like an isreali carrot"
"You look like a highlighter with down syndrome"
"I'm  going to  make you jizzcuzzi with me tonight". Best line in history 👌

The tan of an indian god
Only true 90s kids will understand
I'm gonna make you jizz
Damn, you could have easily cut this up into three videos, but you just throw it all into a single video. It's kind of all over the place but it does flow together well anyways.

"You are like that guy's strange cousin who has never made into the band" - HAHAHAHAA
I am genuinely afraid Ethan is going to get cancer from inhaling all that spray tan.
70k views in 30something minutes.. Jaysus Krise
omfg wow
All hail the meme lords Ethan and Hila.
That Frank dude is one of the most annoying YouTube personalities on the internet. I can't stand him.
ethan. that's a view finder. not vr goggles. you're not a 90s kid, so you just wouldn't understand.
Ethan raped me 30 years ago, he slipped one DJ Khaled in my drink and raped me.
The reason I'm saying this now is cause I was at Walmart and say a Ethan action figure and I broke down crying.
JT might be proud. More worried and awkward filled, but proud. i think.,
Aye it's Johnny boy
Hey Ethan, when will you be dropping your spicy new single on iTunes?
You're officially the funniest person on YouTube
1914s were my favourite

Production values are going off tha chain here, well worth the w8 m8!
"I'm just dancing, This isn't about you right now."   AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
What have you done to yourself Ethan?
Great video Ethan, keep it up!
He was showing too much fupa and he had to hide it 😂😂😂
First comment!!!
ETHAN BRADBURRY surely this deserves top comment
so fucking lit..
Lets just say, It was hard to watch this video.
Americans are use to see so much weird shit,, that they don't even react when they see Ethan Lmao
wtf is with the 9 year olds in comments
Fuck I'm old.

The 90s are closer in time to the pyramids being built than the 90s are to today.
The video started I took my eyes of the screen for a few minutes and when I looked back Ethan was tanned with blond highlights I'm like wtf ?!
What the fuck did i just watch
Did ethanol say VR goggles? its clearly a knockoff view master which is why it was in the garbage
"If you get down on me Ill get down on you" "Im gonna make you cum tonight" LMAO
He set a bar with vape nation that's gonna take some time to surpass
6:40 is he saying: "you look like an israeli carrot"?
Ethan lord dat asssssss
Ethan just sold out... Madison Square Garden, son.
The 90s sucks they didn't have teh kissing pranks
fuck
OH MY GOD PAPABLESS
Ethan's growing tits
dislike for lack of king dunk in the boy band
this video took me so offguard
Finally a new h3h3 reaction video. I've been holding my load for a very long time.
you actually have a pretty good tan.
This is the best. Love you papa
dude i wish i could drop like 50 likes for this vid, the dedication is real :D:D:D:D:D
i thought this was from ethan and hilla and i got my meme flavoured sodypop and i was happy but then i realized it was a h3h3 video and i got HYPEEE PAPA BLESS
we've approached levels of autism not seen before
ETHAN IS SEXY BASTARD
Can I fucking say that I can't believe he actually played this song it caught me off guard holy fuck
I read the title as Elton John's in a 90's boy band. If only that was the case
this made me laugh harder than the vape nation
Niiiiice
ethan looks like the biggest fuk boi.
Was really hoping to see Jon and Frank with fake tans and frosted tips
Does being born in 1998 count as being a 90's kid?
You know 'brave' isn't the word to express how you look.
Ethan, jontron and frank boy band. make it happen.
I did NOT EXPECT THIS TO HE HIS COME BACK VIDEO
If Filthy Frank is telling you to get your shit together something is seriously wrong.
This H3H3 video was absolutely worth the wait, don't understand why Ethan and Hila felt they didnt have enough material because they can make anything entertaining. Good jAaaab
Makin' you jizz tonight
Not enough bracelets, I still give it a solid 5 out of 7.
The unholy trinity of Franku, Ethan, and Jontron only makes my dick more erect.
Ethan there kinda looked like Robert Downey Jr. His face at least and without the hair...
slurp slurp
MY NAMEIS EATEN BRADBERY
OMG, i thought that this was going to be only a reaction video but it turned out like a fucking glorious masterpiece.
wow ethan great moves, proud of you

Holy fuck, Ethan is loosing the plot and Hila won't help him.

Ethan is so dedicated to YouTube it's awesome

This feels more early 2000s to me...
Your Chub N Tuck was giving me a maregasm
fucking masterpiece of comedy
I can watch vomit cake and hair cake without even feeling sick, but him putting that fuck spray and makeup on his face makes me gag. fuck
This is why I love h3.
he plays cs go
Ethan will do anything for the memes.
he's back!!!

Always cracks me up when Frank says nigga
Daniel Day Louis? Leonardo DiCaprio? Nothing compared to Ethan's method acting.

9:17 KHALIDIUS SPOTTED

This is definitely me when my Chub & Tuck is escaping! 😂😂😂

Fucking legend.

Couldn't he join your boyband?
wowethankeepitupgreatmoves
This is amazing.
This relates to me
Schmoyoho? What is this, 2010?

THE BIRTH OF A NEW MEME HAS HAPPENED UPON THIS DAY !!!
That ending was honestly the best things I've seen so far in 2016.
Ethan's got the potato body




And i don't mean the John Mcdougall definition of a potato body
Bronze Nation
WE GOT A FROSTED TIPS ALERT!!!
Lol!! Too funny to see Filthy Frank here!! xD

hahahahahahahahahahaahhaha

Papa bless
CALM YOUR FUPA
"You ain't shit nigga" dammmmm
What Ethan does for us 😂
"You cant stop me from bronzing dude. Why dont you write a tumblr post about it you PC bitch!!!" LMFAO!!!
"Time to relive the magic!"
All the members of the band look like they'd be on some dark lords council. The Bronzed Destroyers.
90's music was the best my generation sucks! 
(im an edgy snowflake)
Good lord that was good.
You're alive?
Love those coughs
I don't know how you managed it, but both h3h3 and Ethan and Hila are at the best they've ever been. It's amazing to get (almost) daily videos that vary and are funny at Ethan and Hila, and to get about every two weeks a memebuster at h3h3. Papa blessed us with a golden age!
Ethan went all out to look like a Romanian gypsy.
Jizzcuzzi.
you look like a poor should khaled
Pussyslayer ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
\//\
3:43 Look at that booty jiggle BOI!
Ey Ethan bOss, can I borrow Hila for tha day? I want to take her for a ride on my scooter
this is my favorite anime
make a vape nation sequel
what the fuck is this
I just cant believe this
If it was acceptable in the 80s, if it was acceptable at the time, then why couldn't it be acceptable in the 90s as well?
You know, the song isn't that bad...
One of the best yet!
I think ethan is br[ok]en
The wait was worth it.
Dude upload more on this channel, its been 3 weeks since the last vid
My ass is sweaty
Those are not fucking VR glasses, it's a fucking ViewMaster.
1like=1 fupa
Can someone explain who that lady is in the computer of the intro
This intro was stimulating in my pants to say the least
Things people do for that dank ass YouTube money xD
Make me come tonight.
Ethan ur fucking dedicated to ur videos
You aint shit nigga.
9:18 Khalidious passing by behind Ethan! WOOOOOW WE FOUND HIM DUDE!
#Jizzcuzzi
Was this all to just say that Ethan was getting a haircut? xd
inb4 b4-4
This is too much for me
I swear to god if this isn't fake I might cry 
That tan is too much
Man Ethan you put yourself through so much in this video.
The year is 2540, a student in history class notices something off about his textbook.  "How come these textbooks skip the years 1990 through 1999?"  The teacher puts his air-marker down on the table, lowers his head, and sighs.  "Because..." he lifts his head, a single tear rolls down his cheek, "...only 90's kids remember the 90's"
Repping the estranged cousin of the Broccoli Cut - the Cauliflower Cut.
So happy rn
I'm in a boyband

ETHAN AND THE BRADBERRIES
Jon and Frank
I want to make you come. - Ethan
H3H3 = Best fucking you tube channel.  the gagging is so priceless.   got to watch this one again ;))))
NEW VID BOYS!!!
This was absolutely disturbing Ethan. This is too far man. I'm unsubscribing and I disliked the video. I demand an apology video.
Ethan and Hila, you two need to create hilarious characters like this and audition for American idol or a similar show. It will bring a lot of attention to your channel and it will be great exposure.
It's a mastapeece
my favorite H3H3 episode ever!
they dont want you to bronze
I am so wet right now mate
just touch the tip lads
Look at this goof bruh.
Sir Francis of the filth, we are your loyal bannermen!!
Wh...what in the living **
know that you are in the bottom of despair when filthy frank find you pathetic
only 90s kids remember
this was frightening
I dieded
I'M BOY BAND BRADBERRY
holy shit hahahahahah
they all look like fucking guy fieri in his prime
Finally a video!!!
now all i have is my dignity and my vibrator
hila finally has the greek god she deserves
Thought he would of done a more relevant video, still surprised and enjoyed this.
This was an exceptionally good video
You can tell Ethan and Jon are friends from their release schedules
I'm wondering how Ethan doesn't have skin cancer after this
damn im early as fuck
first
Ethan you look like an Israeli carrot
You look like bipedal burnt popcorn
You look like the only Italian member of the Jackson 5
You look like the final boss of the Jersey Shore
puka shell necklace tonight
This might be the worst music i have ever heard. Id rather listen to some really awful karaoke cause at least the song it self wouldn't be as terrible as the singer.
"Im gonna make you jizz.....cuzzi with me!"
In some weird way Ethan actually pulls of this look pretty well
What's the huge scar on your back all about?
yo the tannin place woman at 4:02 picking her nose
Ethan went TOO ham on this video! lol.
WTF...ETHAN...WTF
The only good thing about the 90s was the fact that minions didn't exist.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
i would say it is indian face then black face
10/10 Papa bless. Peace love ya.
I'M FUCKING DYING
Hey, DJ Khaled was in New York for the Shorty awards...y'all shoulda ambushed that sheit.
Best H3H3 Video to date

Notification crew reporting in.
yyyeeeeaaahhhhh
It's just a TAN, bro!
I'm a 90s kid.... 1999 BABY!!!!
Best ever h3 video? yes.


Best ever Youtube video? Also yes.
11:25, am i the only one who just noticed how large Ethans head is. Like an adults head on an out of shape teenage boy.
I HAVENT CRINGED SO MUCH IN YEARS
probably the best h3h3 has made in a while. Pissing my pants laughing right now. Love you guys!!!
That song sounded like the Disney afernoon intro.
I think Ethan is a legend for not caring about what other people think about how he looks, the 90's was for top kek  and great memes
this was so ridiculous Jesus Christ, I'm laughing too hard
Canadian pop music on H3H3. Bruh...
Full song version plz...
You've out done yourself h3. A sincere congrats
Wow, Ethan! Great moves, keep it up, proud of you!
Im a 90s kid! I remember the Srebrenica genocide and the Bosnian war! Too true! 😎😎😎😎😎
He's a funny guy!
Chub n Tuck, check. Glasses, check. A fupaload, check.  Tight shorts, check. Frosted tips, check. Take my like you whore.
Why does Ethan sounds like 60 years old Redneck while singing?
disappointing h3h3 video imo seems very forced because people were complaining that you guys dont make enough videos. could only be me though
Great movie, Going to see
Hahahahaha
Ethan why
Woooah! That was kind of classic 90's H3H3.exe VHS internet video
This is what i needed!
2:10 that was a good cough
Frank and Jon in the same video. 

This is Avengers level of crossover
frank u talkin shit but ive seen the rat chef video



looks better on you tho
i lost it when the track was just composed of "ay"s
that was so fucking bad...... to the bone!
It's so cringe to watch you do this to yourself. But I'm glad you have the confidence to do this shit. It makes the videos 10 times funnier.
Wtf man
Funniest shit I've ever watched lol.
good god what have i witnessed
I LIK LE DICK
This is on another level hilarious haha damn you need a show
Next day: H3h3ProductionsVEVO
The first shot of those guys in the music video looks like some uncanny valley CGI.

You went through a lot for just one video lmao

schmoyo's facial expression at 10:09 when asked if he really believes in him had me roaring.
Love this video hahahaha VapeNation <3
Vapenation
Bronze gods, rally to me
That's racist nigga - Papa Franku 2016
That little black kid is probably a gang banger now
Ethan sounds like depressed Britney Spears and Myley Cyris fucked and somehow they had a baby
Creeps on 4chan are trying to find Hila's nudes. Be careful out there. x
VAPE NATIOOOOOOOOOOON

"You look like a highlighter with Down syndrome" Filthy Frank
Maybe it's because I'm a little tipsy right now, but this shit is hilarious. I was actually laughing out loud through most of the video. The wait was definitely worth it.

oh an......something something vapenation....I guess. Can't have an actually constructive comment right. We got to have memes. that's how this works right? Or beg for subs. Fuck the comments are shit on new videos.
I was gonna rip the fattest vape but h3h3 uploaded
Did that boy band get Tango'd?
jeez, the dedication
Are you my Dad?
lol this is too funny, gj!
holy fuck, this was way too funny Ethan lmao
♫ Ethan I'm gonna show you dick tonight
It's my dog's name ♫
I love how he's not embarrassed at all how he looks like in public.
20 years of waiting and we get this
you went full retard, never go full retard
I miss when you could fuck a duck out in public back in 98 good times.
I'm early let me make a joke





Feminism
Jeez papa really committed to this one!
Doesn't smoke weed.
Not the 90's sorry.
Why
Papa blessed ethan with a nice booty ;)
This reminds me of Too many Cooks, and made me sad
It's unnerving how Ethan sounds bad singing despite being completely on-tune.
You and your fuckin' jew hair!
THE MOST SAVAGE, NASTY GREASY GYPSY-JEW TO EVER LIVE ON THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE
this fucking video boi, fuck. hot shit ethan you make my sody go pop
I am FRANKly sick and tired of being in my skin...
this might be your best video yet.

Jizzcuzzi with me tonight lool
The br headset he picked up from the trash was the play station vr, lol
You put yourself through so much shit just for one video. 
Papa Bless Ethan, he's got great moves and will always keep it up
"You look like an Israeli carrot." 
Fucking dead
@5:13 Eirk. if you're reading this, you are a bum. I want my money back. Ethan did it for free!


/jk 8====================================================D~~~~~~~

But seriously, make the damn video already.
Such an inspiration
I absolutely love how Ethan just does not give a shit about anything. LMAO. He outside wearing tacky salmon shirt with printed short-shorts, neon yellow socks, sandals with a glass of wine in hand and too-light tan. 

I want that confidence.
I sense a 90's music revival coming up, guys.
10/10
I love the slight hesitation in Frank's voice when he says nigger.
You're all such cutiepies.
If you get down on me, I'll jizzcuzzi on you. The lyrics write themselves.
Only members of 90s boy bands will understand
V/\
😂
Ethan, I think you can go further! Further than you've ever gone! V/\ V/\ V/\
The New Mixtape is dope nigga
People probably see him on the street and think he has mental problems and feel bad for him, or he kind of looks like an average gay guy...
i like those customgrow420 shades
Ethan what youre wearing looks more 80s than 90s.
This was amazing as always, loved the video and the work put to it ( alot!!! )
Holy shit Hitlist on YTV!! only Canadian 90s kids will remember
So excited to see this!!!!!

That was amazing
This video,  was actually perfect. 

These documentary style videos are so heartwarming. 

They really put alot of work into them.

I was so impressed with the song at the end. 

I wasn't even expecting a song let alone one of such high quality. 

Another beautiful video from H3h3.
I want to see what a skinny Ethan Klein would look like, ripped actually. No photoshop either, and then I want to see him wear that pink tight thing
Omfg i love how dedicaties you are to making quality content
damn that's some dedication to the role
When is the song on itunes?
too funny man.
This is Gold.
Holy fuck Ethan went hard for this video. Great moves, keep it up, don't poison yourself, proud of you!
Mah bronzed bby boi

Anything for views, right guys?
Great work Ethan, keep it up
You're slamming, papa Ethan.
Literally the funniest video you have ever made. Great vid.

Haven't laughed like this to an h3 video in a long ass time...

Jesus Christ.  you are a hero
Nice aesthetics, bub.
Ethan make more music
Aw man... if Jon joined your boyband you would reach the sky! He has the voice of an angel :')
Last time i came this early i had 3 childerns
This is the perfect mix of current H3 and Classic H3. Great moves, keep it up, proud of you.
It's not even funny anymore. h3h3 is dead.
You went over and beyond with this video. Jesus. I love it.
In this episode ethan goes from grey to bronze.

everyone who makes shit jokes in the comments should realise they aren't funny and realise that the only jokes that are funny are the ones that are about skinning peoples pets, child porn and and breaking 12 year old gamers toes and making them in to finger warmers
Please. Make. More. Music.
More frank
1:10 Is that Ricky Carmichael?
Damn Hila, how can you control yourself when you see that beautiful fupa make an appearance....

This is literally the Franksation of h3h3

You've always, looked like you would. have your own show, on Adult Swim.

My favorite boy band was Dream Street in the 90s. >_>
Lets go back to the 19 nine zeros ya'll with ethan and Heela
This is incredible.
Omg! Ethan and Hila! That is so epic! Always remember,"The key to more success is more coco butter."
Ethan needs frosted tips!

So 90s, I WAS BORN IN THE WRONG GENERATION OMG!
Tan Nation
Yup. Best thing on the internet. Ever.

Well that was an emotional rollercoaster
when he said "i'm not dark enough" I genuinely thought he was doing black face for a couple seconds
The things Ethan does for videos, respect for you buddy.
I can't believe your doin black face

Cuzzi
I love your commitment to the MEME Ethan. Everybody's gonna have frosted tips now. Papa Bless, you done goofed.

My cringe button is now permanently smashed down now. Aaaaaaah!

When that YTV logo popped up I bust a nostalgia nut. Canadian nostalgia is best nostalgia.
wow...
I'm gonna make you jizz

When Filthy Frank is the voice of reason, you know you've taken things too far...
Only 90's kid will understand this.
hail hila
THE GODS HAVE UNITED
I MISSED HIS CHANNEL OMG
how did you tan without growing whoopi goldberg hair
Ethan went total Papa Franku.
wow dude
#VAPENATION
Ethan thinks a View Master is virtual reality.
No gaff. All goof. I maybe laughed once, and that was the Israeli carrot joke. Other than the rest was a mid chuckle. Sorry Ethan. The 90's failed you.
The fucking King is back.
Dafuq
The camio's are on point.
#jewsforjesus
"you look like a highlighter with down syndrome" Papa franku
niggas look like they straight outta FFX
your voice is sweet af man
This is one of the best videos you've ever done
'You've taken it too far this is fuckin stupid' are the realest words Franku has ever fucking said damn
5:15 i dont wanna roast but Ethan look like an oompa loompa
5:17 Ethan da pussy slayer
this is their best video ever
I seriously can't tell if the people are in on the joke
I love you.
"you ain't shit nigga"
- filthy frank
I commented on the source video "vape nation" 3 days early... Predictions
also, ethan with dark skin looks like a terrorist
You still can't beat Filthy Frank's music lol
goddamn great job
You have got to appreciate what Ethan does for a fucking video. I APPRECIATE THAT
This was released in 2001/1. Not even 90s meta.
Wow how are you doing this lol the world is a magical place.
I think ethan is the only one that can pull the 90's look off while talking to a failed kamikaze Pilot
You've taken it too far, this is fuckin stupid
THE BROCCOLI IS BACK YALL
loving the collab was hilarious keep it up
This is fucking gold
This guy has absolutely no shame. It's hilarious!
Ethan, you look like Jersey trash.
"You look like an Israeli carrot...."

Genius. Actually he looks how he has always looked, which is to say he looks like a white Aziz Ansari, and his wife/sister/friend with the same last name looks like one of Kristen Wiig's characters. Neither of those observations are meant as insults.

Anyway this video was brilliant.
Why doesn't Papa Franku just adopt you? It would save some time.
Joey salads should join your boy band
Holy shit I can't believe you did this and went to far with it.
what the fuck ethan this is genius and also likely a sign of mental illness
I'm Ethan bradberry
Genius work of art!
Papa Bless
I'm aroused.
Seeing Ethan in that pink shirt made me think Tommy "Too Toned" was making a valiant return.
2:21 hey, mom could you get me some tissues and moisturizer thanks and close the door while ur at it i need a minute.
Over to my house
that scar on his back is from a stab? :v
This might be your magnum opus
Whoa
I SAW THE YTV LOGO!
im just watching this for the eyebrows
Ethan is really put his heart, soul and body into this video!
this shit is dank
HI, THIS IS ETHAN BLACKBERRY!!!
TF did I just watch
I wanna make you cream







CAKE TONIGHT.
POODIEPIE ARMY WILL CONQUER
What happened to the reaction video's?
Jizzcuzzi
you look fucking awful holy shit
This is why he's the best
Why wasn't DJ Khaled featured ?
like a bronze 90's goddess
Ethan you should get in shape and not let it show and then suddenly blow us all away great job
5 seconds after the kid put those Goggles to his face he was already to high on the laced LSD on them to fight back.
papa bless
I just wanted to see if he released a video..15 mins ago..THANK YOU LOOORD
My neighbours love that song at the end so much that they threw a brick through my window to hear it better
h3h3, what a fucking legend! Fucking love it! :D
When FilthyFrank tells you look stupid, then you look fucking stupid!
How come the fake-tan-cool-guy-tips look died? It's beautiful.
You went too far if Filthy was telling you to stop.
Chin
I wonder how it feels walking around NY looking like so many different types of idiot...
late, as always
im gonna make you jizz
what was the fucking budget dude? Also \//\
no fucks given
Papa has blessed us with a new video
Rip Ethan
hmmm, interesting
This was fucking glorious
Tfw you remember these guys are from Ontario. Repping my home province like gods.
B4-4 looks like a trio of lesbian aunts
"I'm gonna make you jizz...cuzzi tonight" lmao
How can ethan continue to look so fucking dank in public xD?
makin you jizz tonight!
Geez
I actually unironically agree with FilthyFrank even though it was scripted. Bit too far for me this time.
dear god what did I just watch
Ethan you look like an Isreali Donald Trump
ew
Greatest H3H3 video yet.
Aauyahahah this is next level!
This has gone too far
GOD.
If Frank tells you to get your shit together, you should know you have a problem
The last time I came this early, I ended up in the house of a boy band from the 90's.
Papa done it again... khaled bless
Is it weird that I really enjoy Ethan's singing voice?
How the hell does Ethan go outside looking like that.
I've been waiting for this one.
We need to start a petition to make Jon and Papa Frank be in Ethan's boy band by law.
