The game gear is actually a sega game system lol
the formula for a a perfect add: go on the spectrum, sprinkle in some really's, and dress up in drag.
REALLY!
5:55 you almost sounded like dunkey
"thanks dust off my house hasn't ever been cleaner"

note that the only two keys not affected on the keyboard shown is "JK" when this is said
Their intro reminds me of a weird foreign reality show.
intro is the best !
one of the best

Im level 921 and prestige 82 in GameAssasinSim420
This is supposed to be aimed at PC gamers, and he's got a Wii, so forget the PC part, and at 8:50 the screen he's cleaning off is an iMac, so you can forget the gaming part too.
"Aw man look at all that crap fly out of there!"
sees nothing
I couldn't stop laughing 😂😂😂
"i gotta squint to look at this shit now" LMFAOO
Why am I just barely coming across this channel? I seriously almost pissed myself watching this lol. Thanks for keeping us bored U.S troops entertained while stationed out in the middle of fuckin nowhere 👍🏽🇺🇸

Your intro is orgasmic, I can't handle the power of Ethan and Hila, I need to go lay down.

There actually probably is enough fragments to clone yourself

WE have the same keyboard dawg
He probably is an assassin of pussy
Around the 6 min mark I wanted to die.
He fucked up his keyboard for one scene lol
OMG i died when i saw his harcut lol.
this guy reminds me of bill nye for some reason
this was my first H3H3 vid
The air gets you high as fuck
Want to become a school shooter? Get the bowl cut
his face made me cringe so much, i almost broke a finger.
"im a gamer gais! look at me referencing games n shit. buy my shity products"
I've watched this 3 times already
Well atleast he's not born mobile.
"my keyboard has never been more clean" says as the only clean keys are jk

5:09 Problem Ethan?
Still to this day my favourite video from h3h3
A bowl of broccoli cut
10:24 to the end
It killed me
Kids in Africa could've ate the keyboard
I died a little inside when Ethan fucked up his mouse and keyboard.
thanks mister on the spectrum XD IM DONE!
I like how the only clean keys on the keyboard that were clean were the "J" and "K" keys.
REALLY!
who the fuck games on an Apple computer
I cried laughing at the beginning!!!!!! Ethan is the funniest guy on YouTube. Holy shit.
REALLY?!?
i still fucking lose it at 5:45
Hello everybody! I would really greatly appreciate it if you guys would checkout my channel and give me feedback on how I am doing! Thanks guys! Have a great day!
Ross from GameGrumps
this cringe will last forever
Lol, I own the same keyboard he just poured cheese into.
There is actually no problem if you keep it hibernated, hibernation files stay in Hard disk
6:22 
>Rias Gremory is joining the Terrorist Force

Hold up, are we just going to ignore BigDaddyWooWoo?
The laughing part actually killed me

Ourmine is back
Omg... ourmine is ruining titles
These products are worse than beauty products that many in-secure people use.
Damn his channel got hit with the Our Mine are back virus
Yo Ethan and Hila, I think your channel has been hacked our something because most of your videos say something about   a company called "Ourmine". It says it's checking security, but I think it's malware.
Now I have to guess what video is what, THANKS OURMINE (please don't hack me)
WHAT THE FUCK IS OURMINE JESUS FUCKING CHIRST!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGHH!!!!!!!!
wtf is ourmine ??
What's with the "ourmine are back"
Oh shit Ethan got hacked
Our mine you crappy security company
why is every title hey it's ourmine
NO why our mine 4/1/17
Oh my god miniminter hacked and h3 hacked by our mine, our mine going on a riot
The guy looks a better woman than a man
How is a guitar, gamer gear?
REALLY
This cringe gave me crippling depression
you got the same hair as my 57 year old dad
Hila is sooo hot, would you invite me to an interview if I created a fake interview about a fake interview about this comment?
0:14 "MMR is just a number" Danil "Dendi" Ishutin

The cringe is real
Why are the best videos on YouTube right on my birthday? 
Coincidence? I think not!
oh my god Ethan please tell me that keyboard was already broken 😱😂
This video makes my heart break with Ethan messing his keyboard with nacho cheese and doritos.
i feel bad for the people that bought there product, if anyone even bought it.
6:09 those were many try shots But they are all so good that they made it in the video
19/10 cringe
does anyone else think the haircut make him look black
This was the first video I saw on this channel, which happened to be the night my grandmother died. It really helped distract me and still makes me laugh today. So, thanks Ethan and hila for the goofs, love and appreciate ya ❤
This is definitely my favorite h3h3 video
The laughter scared the shit out of me
This commercial really gets my fupa going
10:03 What is that noise? It sounds like a dog barking with delay and reverb but the stereo panning is crazy.
Ethan is that my fucking keyboard?
Is that Michele Obama in his intro?
REALLY
9:28 OOOOO
4:53 i died at this part omfg
this guy made a channel.....
gamer guy and the guardians
my life is complete
Plot twist that was his mother not him in drag
"Thanks mr on the spectrum" lmao

6:23 BigDaddyWooWoo must be so proud if he knows what he had done

Really?
😲😲😲😲😲😲
HE CUT HIS HAIR
gamer gunk cleaner genger
Is this a bowl cut or a broccoli cut?! Hahahahahaha
The crying noises in the back genuinely makes me feel uncomfortable, sounds like it's coming from my door jesus christ.
Something tells me Ethan wrote this whole video because he needed a hair cut lol.
ever hecked around on Omegle?
Love your new hair
You probably fuckin'  SIIICK!!
I think I just cringed into anger dimension.
Love your videos, but you basically just pulled a TechRax on that gaming keyboard
there was a commercial before with kitties in it and im positive that that is the only way i will not immediately or at all press the skip ad button
I need to rip a fat cone
Keep the hair
I have a broken arm. So, how can I clean my keyboard with only one hand if I can't hold it like an accordion?
That broccoli cut tho LOL
This guy looks like the flash with down syndrome.
Classic
gamer gung cleaner cinger
the giggling sounds like its actually coming from behind nice psychocacoustic trick l0l
how average Americans say "dude"-dude
how Ethan says "dude"-d3wd
You where killed by someone called DaddyBabyWooWoo

1:58
I love titles i believe all women are not real people. They should just help men
Even Tornado9 could beat him
H3 ruined my keyboard! (Srsly that's my keyboard)
I dont Even know what the fuck an acordion is
That haircut made my day :DDDDDDd

At 6:30 did anyone notice the camera zoomed in on JK on the keyboard?
Dont call me a dudette fucking retard (not ethan)
when did put that shit on keyboard, it broke my heart :'3
but when the hair was cut, +1 to dedication and +1 to like
He says he will tell you...Reeaallly! but never does. leaves you hanging in suspense. goddammit
Wait...Ethan Allen? Did he take his wife's last name?
my favorite h3h3 video
"wow, ethan, great moves, keep it up, proud of you." Michelle Obama, 1981
Ethan is playing CS:GO with an IBUYPOWER keyboard and mouse. I bet he is gonna THROW that away after this video HAHAHAHAHAH.
i almost had a heard attack listening to those giggling noise i was like this nigga fr real tho
"Rias Gremory is joining the Terrorist force"

..what?
Sikh dude
his neck is as long as the first 2 comments down there
This guy isnt on the spectrum, i work with people on the spectrum .  This guy is just an idiot.
crazy how the broccoli assassin cut is now in vogue
I got the feeling h3h3 always make people famous... sometimes good, sometimes bad

I hope i'll be as famous as those dudes and dudettes one day...
What the fuck is this channel fucking amazing.
this kid probly has aspurgers or something because there's no way he can expect to function in this world acting this cringy
I fucking lost it at "thanks mr. On the spectrum"
3:35 Ethan looks ready to ASSASSINATE some GAMES :0
I love when he sips the water and screams lol I rewind it like 15 times aaahahah

I still ironically use the word dudette to this day
Someone has to turn the 'really' bit into a gif

I died a little inside when I saw his keyboard.
h3h3 = Ryme master

and thats how you use gamer gunk-k clinger ginger, to clean your gamer gunk.
kids in gamer duster air could've eaten h3h3production's salsa dipping sauce on his screen
sans warning!!!
6:22 the name feels intensifying
He's a gamer but he has a mac?? 8:46
The glorious days of h3h3
This is why you get a mechanical keyboard... easy to clean and doesn't break.
That was actually happy monkey,  not comic sans
Csgo in background
his neck is longer than my lifespan
Did you really have CS GO on a youtube video.
Proof Ethan is how to basic
Kids in africa could've eaten that broccoli
"Gamer gear glasses, help you see the game"
Ethan: "I can't see"
gamergingur
Did he clean off jk on purpose?
His intro is superb👌🏼💦
Lol that Ethan giggle at 5:50
Oh shit, I just realized that Ethan is really Al Lewis, the Grandpa on the Munsters!!!
Ummmmm, broccoli.... pass the butter!
REALLY?
REALLY?
when ethan fucked his keyboard up i cried even for a joke it was too stresful watching the keyboard shouting for help
C L E A N
It's not just any air, it's o' hare!
It's a sad day for gamers.....

okay now I understand that one subreddit
classic
BidDaddyWooWoo

That was the hardest dry-heave laugh I've ever had from a joke, coming from someone who's on the spectrum.
"That made me like, react."
prime h3
R those heat sync black things on the wall for dampening sound echos?
You guys are Probably gone to get sued again
9 seconds into the video and he has 2 minutes of roasting the fucker lol

Seeing you put all of those greasy stuff makes me Uneasy, Jesus christ
5:50 so cute
5:49 love that laugh
Ross, is that you?
8:46 Who tf games on a Mac?
No matter how many times I watch this shit, I die laughing.

Is he talking about anal?
I am absolutely in love with the intro! anyone else with me?
0:00 to 0:35 is too fucking funny.
you're supposed blow the duster in your mouth and inhale for it to work properly
I was watching this at midnight and that giggling at 10:04 scared the shit out of me.
When it comes to keeping your gaming gear it peak performance, oh the games people play...REaLlY A lotta you game assassins seem to think that....
5:32 I inhale both of those cans to get high, it feels good!
REALLY nice haircut btw dude
i used to get this ad
put your hair down, put bowl of your head, twist bowl, "bowl hair cut".
I thought the clone joke was edited by Ethan... I was unfortunately wrong
he has a cyber power PC??? I knew  I recognized that stupid keyboard with the red buttons. thank you for putting all that dip on what that piece of garbage that was. also why does every one outside of video games think that people who play video games just fill their keyboards with junk, talk like retards, and say "pew pew pew"? (on a side note though, who the hell has a CD ROM in their computer?)
4:46 a god damn logictech keyboard my fucking school uses that
this dude
Really!
Ethan got that lil yachty cut
Chadtronic did a video on this
I got those glasses and now I'm ranked number one on COD
4:52 is that joeys world tour?
That autism line fucking killed me. Fuuuuuck  hahaha
this is probably my favorite h3h3 video
Omg who writes the subtitles?? They are hilarious!
This is cringe X1000000
REALLY?
GOAT
can I hire the broccoli assassin to kill my meal
Vinesauce Joel or H3H3 who did this better?
ethan is so dumb if he thinks his keyboard is clean... (THIS IS A JOKE DONT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY)
Man they hit the target market dusting off that gaming imac screen too.  Everybody games  on an imac these days.  Well thought out marketing, I give it an 11.
I'm so ashamed I just started watching your videos...
This has to be my 2nd best video of h3h3 after Vape Nation
This proves how us gamers are viewed as immature children... sigh
#broccoliassassin
"Thanks Mr on the spectrum." Floored me
I got the exact same keyboard as Ethan xD
what is this a how to basic video p.s. idubbbz
I assassinate games.
That baby wipe joke takes on a whole new meaning after their proposal story
If I could like this again, I would. Classic. That's it ladies and terminators lmfaO
Holy shit that giggling scared the fuck out of me.
"thanks mr. on the spectrum"

Watching him destroy a keyboard hurt my soul as a gamer
"Comic sans warning".  Lost it. Fucking comic sans...god damn it. It's EVERYWHERE in Florida. Even...dentist offices...

"I'm a DDS, but have a good personality. Take me seriously, please."
R E A L L Y

Vagina boob
Did no one catch that his gaming pc was a mac?
ross extra autistic that day on dame drumps or what happend?
REALLY?
I completely lost control at the "footage of actual gamer"
To be fair their video was targeting the "gamers" grandparents who know nothing about gaming but want to buy their grandkid something they know nothing about and prolly hate. ect,
How does I put disc into computer and follow instructions when it's O F F off?
Anyone else want some queso, Doritos, and broccoli? Because I do. Even though this fuck forgot the mountain dew to wash everything down with.
I want Ethan to be my weird uncle...
Reow
I like your vids but your intro is cancer
Ahh so cringe
I'm a broccoli assassin

Love that intro
GAMER GUNK MEANS SEMEN, TRUST ME I WOULD KNOW

PBG, what happened?
5:50 that maniacal laugh!
Ethan klein? hila klein? 
CALVIN KLEIN
That hair cut is know in Venezuela as "corte de tapara", very popular amid aboriginal people.

"Thanks, Mr. On-The-Spectrum."

Hila the barber?
I just couldn't handle the cringe when mom showed up! Too much!
I kept a straight face until 4:47 and then I lost it
Looks like afterprisonshow
It's so hard to watch kids with autism. It's really just an excuse for kids to misbehave, kind of like adhd.
I use a typewriter covered in mash potato's and cow eyes with brain fragments and I'm global elite on CS:GO
Ethan's hair grew back to try to escape the cringe lmfao 😂
like windex and a paper towel wont clean your screen
h3h3 productions you are a bully becasue during this video i tried to clean my stuff off with gamer gear but u could not because you kept making me laugh.
lol faze rain have hair like that 3:46
He looks slightly like Ross O'donovan but with uglier hair.
i want a husband like Ethan
lmfao Ethan's bowl cut was amazing
3:33 tbh he looks dope
That gamer water made me piss myself
You also need your Gamer Rag to clean the sperm markings that are on your monitor, OH and don't forget to wash your hands!
Ths guy is a legend because he became friends with everyone that hated on him
finish him
he looks like lispyjimmy
lol a 80 year old prob  made this
he looks like the guy from Scooby-Doo
Ur broccoli cut looks better than ur regular one
🏍
"thanks mister on the spectrum" 
lmao at the subtle autism joke
I love how h3h3 doesn't change himself for comedy
lmfao how do you edit these videos without dying. #lit #woke
why do people hate comic sans
These type of commercials made me sell all of my game's and console's as teen, It got pretty embarrassing, I only recently bought a ps4 and it seems like this "gamer" shit is finally dying.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this dude's voice working for watchmojo?
Still one of my favorites
Broccoli assassin.
You cant make funn of self-sarcastic man but you still make it great
great boobs or moves? im confused
My teacher didn't give me 100% because I used Comic Sans as my font in my programming project.
Reeeaaalllly Reeeeaaaaalllly Reeeaaalllly Reeeaaalllly.
I just use a 60PSI air compressor bigger than me and its better than ANYTHING
DUDE THE FUCKING LAUGHING ACTUALLY SPOOKED ME

Him fucking up his mouse and keyboard made me genuinely uncomfortable.

From the side your hair cut looks good
ethan looks like fucking kramer with that haircut
his neck,  his eyes..... gahhhh 
looks like the sloth from Ice Age,  a good looking slutty game cleaning spray sloth, ready to g oh be you the good broth
It annoys me how his eyes are so far apart
broccoliassassin would defiantly beat the Legend27
you could get high off keyboard duster
girls had bowl cuts too, just named Dorothy hamels instead...
Honestly pressurized air is so expensive it's cheaper to have an air compressor
I bet he is the legend 27
"Thanks Mr. On the Spectrum" 😂😂😂
He looks a tiny bit like me. Some people think I look retarded 🙁 they treat me like I always need assistance. You are all a lot better than me 😒
my 2 favorite "reaction" channels did the same video. Love it.
your not a broccoli assasin your a retard
wow ethan great moves keep it up proud of you
Why, again Ethan you didn't say we needed the hasmat suit, but we do the cringe is to strong

It's a Fact!
I like the into
10:03 Warning headphone users! This literally scared the living shit out of me!
That fucking haircut is epic



R34LLY
After that haircut I couldn't tell if Ethan was a broccoli assassin or an organ god
REALLY!?!
He looks like Tingle from Ocarina
R-R-R-R-R-R-R-REALLY
Who is disliking ? WTF
This guy didn't deserve this.  I like your videos, but you were just being a bully in this one.
Ethan, your gaming keyboard is kinda gross.
Ethan looks like stitches after the haircut

You seem abusive to your wife
Are you sure the a Gamer Water isn't pumped full of acid?
This... I was biting my lips to hold it in at the end. Tears were pouring down my cheeks as a strained to hold my mouth shut.
THIS IS IN BOLD
Broccoli assassin xDDD i cant
no offence but this dude looks cringey
I couldn't get out of my head that the guy kinda looks like Rubber Ross
This guy is the original split

The "really" part reminded me of a ray William Johnston video
Discount Ross ODonovan
Dildo Baggins
I have that same monitor

anyone else think Ethan looks like Pablo Escobar in Narcos?
I'm crying
gotta do it clean
lets have a moment of silence for that keyboard..... it died for a great cause and has lived through many, many years of gamer type wear and tear such as skeet all over him and i respect that he did that for ethan when he didnt have a napkin nearby 


 he shall be remembered ;(
3:55 
98% of guys in my school have that haircut and think they're the shit
First saw the gamer gear video from Vinesauce Joel! Loved this vid

Thanks Mr. "On the spectrum".

epic editing......reaaaaalllllllllyyyyyyy!!!!!
the funny thing is, half the teens of this generation have a "broccoli" cut lmao
Do you think God stays in Heaven cause he too is afraid of what he's created??
The cringe feel sick to my stomach
There's enough space between this guy's eyes to fit another three eyes.  Christ, his eyes are so far apart they bearly fitted inside those glasses he was wearing.
9:17 lol my gawd
6:07 CSGO
Dust Off Is great for huffing. It is pretty dank.
i had to pause it during the mom part thats how hard i cringed

"Thanks Mister On-The-Spectrum" OMG

Funnily enough, he makes a more convincing woman than a gamer.

Stop
LET'S GET THIS TO SIX MILLION VIEWS
Is That A Gamr Buzzer? I Died At that Part 😂😂
His hair was still on point after the cut tho.
did anyone notice that the keyboard letter that got  cleaned,was jk?
This is the funniest shit
Did this guy really just insult autistic people? If you heard him say "Thanks mister On The Spectrum" That refers to the autistic spectrum, a statement implying that what he witnessed was autistic, while it's not blatently said, he still said it in a way to use autism as an insult, this coming from the guy who was all up leafy's ass when he drilled into an autistic guy he, apparently, didn't know was autistic, can someone give this man the hypocrite medal?
What's funny is that ethan can't progress 5 seconds without finding something cringe
don't worry its not house hold cleaning gear its not its not trust me FUCKING TRUST ME
LMFAO
He did a response video
dude when that shit giggled i thought it was coming from upstairs and almost shit myself

"Thanks Mr. On-The-Spectrum." 
I'm dead...

Oh man, this was the laugh I needed soooo bad all day. I almost cried laughing! So much love for this channel!!!!
OMG I have seen this like 10 times now and I still laugh 😂

WTF
I think this is the 69th time I've watched this video.
7:52
"Thanks Mr. On the Spectrum," has to be one of my favorite H3H3 lines.
Bruh just get a wet paper towel.
5:10 my school uses Comic Sans for literally everything
I love the zoom in on the "J" and "K" keys after he 'cleans' the keyboard. Don't know if that was planned but it was great!
The only person I know that made a conscious effort to fuck their hair up and it ended up looking better than it did before.
That shot where you had cheese all over your keyboard was fucking disgusting
The fucking nacho on the keyboard and mouse made me scream internally.
Hands down the best H3H3 production.
I just realized he called Ethan bradberrys brother a broccoli assassin
The sounds at the end took me by surprise. I was wearing headphones but they sounded like they were out the window haha
This air is the best air. You cannot find air like O'Hare Air brand air anywhere!
6:29 I just noticed the "jk"... slow.
Really tho?
'My gaming gear has never been cleaner, thanks to dust off'
unironic jk on the keyboard
He's talking about "gaming gear" and he wiped off a mac screen.......
im cringing so hard... what did your keyboard and mouse ever do to you???
I have the same keyboard
l.m.f.a.o.
R E A L L Y
I use the same air compressor I use on the tires of my truck to clean my keyboards, and petrol works fucking well as a cleaning product too.
Check out the keys on the board after he says this. @6:27-6:31 LOL!
Take a shot every time he says gamer/gaming
I don't care what anyone says, that is JC Chasez.
Holy fuck that haircut I laughed my ass off
2:17 xD
dudet 👩
You're fun to get high to.
Overloaded levels of cringe. Cringe nuke inbound
Literally crying right now!! HOLY SHIT!
You wanna know a dirty secret

February is black history month. We need to remember that big black cock (BBC) is superior to small white cock (SWC).
REALLY? .................... No really what the fuck is wrong with this dude :D:D:D Maybe he some one should've blown some of that special air into his mother when he was in there ... because he sure ain't got enough oxygen back then lol

Ethan had a crappy haircut just for a joke... He truly is the Meme God.
When the cringe is too stroung
Good vid mate
That guy is like Bill Nye, he knows nothing about what he's doing but is paid to act like he knows what he's doing, also this idiot thinks that in any game you can dual wield guns and do a finisher attack as if you are in Mortal Kombat, ALSOOOO, I don't think my mom would be proud of me killing everything in sight with 2 Puissant Norfleets on Borderlands 2.
LOL. They use the NoScope glasses!
9:46 As a guy who is on the spectrum I would just like to say that it wouldn't surprise me if the dust-off guy is on the spectrum. hell, I've had days where I've felt as disconnected from reality as the dust-off guy acts

I'm honoured to have the same keyboard as Ethan.
The guy looks like Ross O'donovan
Best video on this channel.
What in the Outsider's name did you just fucking say about me, you lowly City Watch Guard? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in transversals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Dunwall Tower, and I have over 500 confirmed assassinations. I am trained in teleporting randomly in front of people then stabbing them and I’m the top sniper in the entire Whalers. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this dimension or the Void, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Youtubes? Think again, maggot. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of 1337 hackers and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the swarm of rats, choffer. The swarm that will chew the living flesh off your bones and wipe out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking eliminated, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my wristbow. Not only am I extensively trained in assassinating, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Whalers and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the Isles, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you street-pisser. I will shit whiskey and cigars all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

H3h3 he didn't deserve all dat hate

Oh my god, I have to say that I've been going through some tough times emotionally recently, and Ethan Klein is making that all melt away. I could watch this guy for days on end at this rate and never get tired of him, I'm really happy I finally checked his channel out. Great job, Ethan, you have created the perfect cure for depressive feelings! Also, I think I might be showing signs of an addiction...
Hila is sharp wit dat razor!
At 6:00 I thought he was gonna spray his dick.

Great video, Ethan! Mom would be so proud!
I saw this video when it was first uploaded, and I still can't get enough of it. REALLY! One of my favourite h3h3 vids of all time
H3h3 reminds me of fucking Tim and Eric sometimes.
I know it gets over used these days but this guy is literal cringe. I think he may even be a cringe elemental! I don't know man, how do we fight a being of pure cringe?
It is 1:30 AM and the thumbnail is scaring the shit out of me.
The laughing made me grab an air soft gun because it's really late at night, mother of god...
"Thanks Mr. On-The-Spectrum"
underrated joke of the year
Damn Ethan you rekt those noobs with a nova? Respect!
No I do not feel comfortable when you call me that
I want to hang out.
Ethan got dope fade goin on
Chadtronic reacted to this first
its 2am and that fucking giggling in my headphones freaked me out.
§đ
the one the spectrum joke reassured my place in hell.
Tell me why he looks like Barry B. Benson?
Your hair makes you look that ginger guy from Megamind

Kids in Africa could've eaten that Gamer Duster Air
tries searching up the h1n1 disease








wtf is this
Okay, this is a great video, but the video he was watching genuinely offends me. They didn't even try. They hit all the fucking low notes. I couldn't tell if it was for an average gamer or a child. It's like that "How do ya do, fellow kids". I hope that one of the executives that authorized that ad went home and found his wife cheating with the piece of shit actor from the ad.

Jesus, I am a fucking nerd... I just sperged the fuck out...
your freezing it ethan when you flip the air can
id buy that  keyboard.
OHHHHH THE CRINGE
but it scared the shit out of me when the giggling sounds came though
funniest fucking video on earth

I have the keyboard and mouse that you fucked up.
I LAUGHED SO HARD I GOT A BONER

This "GetDustOff" guy hasnt been active for 3 years, what happened?
rest in peace keyboard

ewe you dont have an optical drive
Dude that sick cut looks like faze-"REALLY"-rain dudette
Bruh when the giggles started coming I got kinda scared 😂
he looks like the lovechild of Topher Grace and Sid from Ice age?
Hey, from a scale from 1-10 how much power does he use to react. 1 being least power. 

XD
5:00 MY GOD
is it me or does that guy look like ross from GameGrumps?
The thanks mr on the spectrum part had me weak 😂😂
what is a gay massassin?
2:34
he looks like Karim Benzema, when he shaves a little bit of his hair
I cried at 0:27. Thank you Ethan.
Why would it be giggling? It would be fucking screaming cause it's getting all damaged from the cheap disc! Again with he's mom thing? He makes it sound like he's a pedophile!
That's so funny how that guy thinks he's cool, but isn't! He acts like he's a pro gamer by selling these products! He looks like a chimpmunk squirrel infused baby hideous creature!😂
i watched a video of his in science class
The guy looks like a fucking velociraptor
R E A L L Y
this is my favourite H3 episode
Your haircut (bowl-cut) actually fitts you XD
WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA!!!!!!

I am literally holding an accordion while you said that!

WHERE ALL MY ACCORDIONISTS AT?!?!?!
that dip is really fucking good tho.
My favorite h3h3 video
banging the keyboard worked better
The person who finds the keyboard in the trash must have been A-PAULED.
"REALLY?!?!", would be a great meme.
We are Number One

Now listen closely
Here's a little lesson in trickery
This is going down in history
If you wanna be a Villain Number One
You have to chase a superhero on the run



I got bored
its too much cringe man i cant watch it
That hair looks epic actually, fits the 2016 trend.
The original LispyJimmy.
Holy shit you're literally so ugly you can get an absolute shit joke haircut and it doesn't make the slightest difference in your appearance
You fucked up your hair and your keyboard for this video
React to Guava Juice or Marlin. Do it.
he's a game assassin yet he uses a fucking mac, really..
Ive been rocking the bowl cut for 20 years....FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing video dude
Broccoli cut=Curly from Buzzfeed
Pleb
The only person that probably even says 'Dudettes' is Aph America.
that dudes eyes are too fucking far apart
I thought it was cool When I saw that me and Ethan have the same monitor, I thought it was even cooler when I saw that we have the same keyboard too
When he said you can hear giggling from the player and that noise came played I almost pissed
Never have cringed this hard
he looks like Adam Kovic lol
if you get gamer gear glasses,you'll get so much pussy on mommy makeout day!
When the guy being payed for the video knows nothing about gaming
Pause at 0:28. Practically my life
I'm sitting here crying with laughter trying to explain to my bf, who didn't see the whole video, why this is funny. 

why is this so funny?!?

Do you think that thelegend27 uses Gamer Gear to be so good?
The "gamer" guy kind of reminds me of Robby Motts ( the temporary =3 host of 2014).
Why the fuck do you call your wife "Dude"
You were supposed to use a bigger bowl
6:30 i like how only the "jk" is clean
My armpit smells like coconut
6:30 Did you clean "jk" letters the most on purpose? If so- you're genius Ethan.
Really?
Omg I died.
Is this the stuff Krusher99 uses to be so good
Help I don't understand this video
The intro to this one might be my favorite thing ever
My first H3H3 video I watched. Got hooked. Papa Bless
"And that's how you use gamer gunk clinger gin-ger, to clean your gamer gunk"
Just go to 8:17
H3h3 I get where your coming from but it says for dust not for ketchup and whatever was on that keyboard like if you agree
The best thing about this is that the guy in the video made a reaction and it's absolutely hilarious.
Yoooo Ethan you looked like the fucciest fuccboi with that broccoli cut my boi keep that shit
I legitimately think that the spokesperson is autistic
And thats how you use gamer gunk cleaner ginger.
This air is the best air. You cannot find air better than this air, anywair.
Tbh I think the bowl cut kinda suits you h3 aka Ethan
9:47 I'm crying oml

why ethan why?
Why is his neck so long?
I am crying actual tears! RRReally?!
FAV ONE STILL TO THIS DAY THIS ETHAN
You and Chadtronic know how a reaction channel should be.
Gamer dudes, dudettes. When it comes to keep your gamer gear at peak performance, oh the games people play. REALLY. A lot of you game assassins seem to think that skill alone is gonna get you to the victory lane, as you go leaping from level to level, room to room, and world to world! With little or no effort. Ooooooh planet rangers, you wanna know one little dirty secret? Yeah-huh do ya? You're not gonna get there if your gear's all crapped up with gamer gunk. Dust. Chip dip. Greasy sticker slimy game residue! It's a fact! Dirty gear doesn't perform as well as clean gear, and may even crash, and burn! OH NOO! UGHHH! You can't do it dirty, you gotta do it clean, and here's how. This stuff, right here, this stuff!? This is the good stuff, the right stuff, the Dust Off® stuff. The only stuff you should use to clean your gear. First, because it works, duh. Second because when used properly it’s completely safe. And third, cause it’s the best stuff out there. According to experts, like me! Let’s get cleaning. Now, the keyboard. Grab it sideways kinda like you’re gonna play an accordion. Grab your Dust Off Gamer Gear® duster from your gamer kit, and holding the can upright spraying short bursts as you work your way around all those nooks and crannies. Oh man! Just look at all that crap flying outta there. There must’ve been an entire bowl of cereal down there, and uh enough skin fragments to clone yourself. When you’re done spraying, take a swab for the tiny places, and then take this Dust Off Gaming Gear® wipe and wipe off the top, the front, the back and the sides so you kill all those nasty germs. KILL THEM ALL! PSHEW PSHEW PSHEW PSHEW PBBBBB. FINISH HIM. Keyboard is done baby! Now the mouse. Same drill as the keyboard. Hold the Dust Off® LCD spray, give it a spray, then a good wipe-down with the Dust Off Game Gear® swab and wipe. And you’re all set. You may be saying you can skip this step because you have one of those cool laser meeces. Lasers need to be cleaned too, so you’re not off the hook on that one. Next, we move onto the screen. For this step, we have a specially formulated Dust Off® screen spray and Dust Off® shammy. And let me tell you folks, it is not a paper towel and window cleaner. It is not that. It’s totally safe for the screen and for you! Spray it one like this, wipe it off like this! And you’re all set. Oh and uh you can spray on the acrylic parts too so they’re nice and shiny. Mom would be so proud. Now, for the scary part! THE COMPUTER! It’s definitely worth another reminder from Mr. Safety. “Now make sure, the entire computer is off. Not hibernatin’ or sleepin’. But completely O. F. F. Off.” Thanks Mr. Safety. CPUs have just a couple of screws. You can unscrew when you unscrew the housing, your manual, assuming you didn’t throw it away like I did, uh will show you how to do it. Carefully remove the housing and, IT’S ALIVE! Welcome to the inner sectom. This isn’t so scary. We’re not even gonna touch anything. Grab your Dust Off Gaming® duster, and blowing from the inside out, very important, inside out, spray the fan. Then, spray the motherboard, and other components. Do not use a leaf blower! VOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Do not use a vacuum! VOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Vacuums can cause static discharge and could severely damage your computer. When we are done, replace the housing and we’re just about finished. The last part of the cleaning does require that the computer be turned on, so turn that baby on man! soft rock “Listen to that baby hum”. Now, we’re gonna clean the optics of your CD, DVD, and Blue-ray player. Using this special formulated Dust Off® cleaning disk, open the tray, slide it in ;). And follow the audio instructions. If you hear closely, you can hear giggling coming from the player, it’s so happy to be cleaned. That’s it ladies and terminators. So remember, before you get your game on, get your clean on Gamer Gear Dust Off®. Keep it clean, keep it new, keep it Dust Off®, for gaming.
anyone else notice his hair grew back?
Your poor keyboard
you look like the guy form the weekend
Oh the games we'll play....
jesus dude
10:02 scared the FUCK out of me.  that giggling sounds like it's coming from down my hallway WHAT THE FUCK.
broccoli hairstyle looked cool
Wow Hila really nailed to Steve Jobs look at 3:05
(   ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )
What if you have a laptop, I'll have to turn to the news for help.
Gunkistan, 2005. Taliban forces amass along the Gunk River in preparation for an assault on US troops. The base is heavily fortified but there's one problem. A massive gunkstorm is brewing. US soldiers do their best to keep their weapons clean, but there's gunk everywhere. If their rifles jam, it could spell doom for the outpost.
My grandparents got me this for Christmas... I pissed myself laughing.
h3h3 has became faze apex
His haircut reminds me of the time I went to go try out Rocket League at a GameStop and a kid who had a few screws missing starting randomly talking to me and shoving a Harry Potter figurine in my face. Fun times.
The cringe is too strong
"gamer gunk cleaner geanger"
Bill Nye's lost son.

Sweet jesus, how is that even a real advertisement
I like how they giggle at 5:50 ^^. H3H3 always makes my day.

he reminds me of barry allan from the flash TV series
[[[[CRINGE INTENSIFIES] INTENSIFIES] INTENSIFIES] INTENSIFIES]
Tbh that haircut doesn't look that bad on him. Just needs a little fixing/lining up
"That made me, like, react™."

Say that again, fucker. I dare you.

Yeah, that's what I thought. No more react™ing around these parts, bucko.

I guess you could say I'm... LA's FINEst.

Like the brothers... and I'm acting like a cop, also...

Yep.
really*
fuck watching him dump that shit on his keyboard and mouse was the most painful shit I've ever seen
This dude looks exactly like the actor that plays Pablo Escobar in "Narcos"
Fuck! You got swedish, polish, dutch, spanish and french but no portuguese? C`mon duuuuude! 
Anal?

This guy reminds me of the creepy botanist shut-in from Twin Peaks. Maybe, just maybe, someone will set off his agoraphobia and he'll kill himself too.

Edit: not Ethan, the anthropomorphized vagina Ethan is reacting to.
8:51 A mac???? REEAAAALLLYYYY???? A GAMING PC?????
Broccoli assassin

"This water is pulsing with energy[...]", nope its just triggered 0:28...

I love this thumbnail lol
that haircut is tight though
The broccoli cut is totally what Casey Neistat has
great même gear
He may no longer have his dignity, but at least he still has his virginity.
I love watching you high. You're a crazy bastard love from Scotland.
9:46 "Thanks Mr. On The Spectrum" By far the best joke I've heard this year. Holy fuck.
I haven't laughed this hard in awhile, thanks h3h3
Jesus, just put it in the dishwasher.
Good shit bro keep it up lol
I just realized something, 9:50 tells us to put the disk in and follow the audio instructions, even though 10 seconds earlier he told us to make sure the whole PC is off. Bruh make up your damn mind.
"Thanks Mr. On The Spectrum" I died
8:16
H3H3 Rocking the cut before the weekend in STARBOY!.
broccoli assassin
H3h3, i have one question. Are you the actor Andy Milder? Just google him and the similarities are endless
What the fuck is a Game Assassin.
Some say "Oi Really Owl" meme isn't dead. It's spirit and still lives inside of this guy.
The cut still look sick
i gotta be honest i thought h3h3 put in the "don't clone yourself" lol
ethans hsir regrew through the length of the video.
Lol gamer water
RLY!!!!!
broccoli assassin - newest in fashion
I'm a real gamer. xD
I laughed so hard while you were cleaning that keyboard.
Fuck Ethan and Hila are the shit hahaha
I left a comment #savehila
Wish he still did these extended intros, put me in tears every time!!!
Really
Brock Lee
All you need is rubbing alcohol, paper towels, q-tips, and a microfiber cloth to clean your shit
Cringe
Goddamnit this guy is fucking hilarious 😂😂😂
Oh the good times...
Rias hahahahaha!
At first when the guy said "chip dip", i thought he said "chick dick".
Oh and fuck "comic sans" and "papyrus".
the water bit made me laugh so hard
I used to use the same keyboard as Eathan
"Thanks Mr 'On the spectrum'" dead
Ethan's giggle at 5:52 😂😂
Ethan do you not have a pc tray? The fuck man? You need that to pirate older games off the Internet and sell them for extra shekels.
This is a classic H3H3 video.
The vid that made me sub
"We've got ourselves a badass heeeeeeeeeeee"
5:55 Gamer Gunk Cleaner Geengur
Anal?

"You can't it dirty you gotta do it clean."😜
that guys got really wide eyes
You can't do it dirty, You gotta do it clean, And that's how.. WEAR A CONDOM! 5:14
That subtle JK on the keyboard
brocolli
That "no" part that hila said wasn't hila it was a sound clip.
cherdtrenic? izzat u cherd?
I literally yelled, "NOO! NOT THE KEYBOARD" when all that gunk was poured on it.
I mean Ethan it is just a baby wipe....a baby wipe that u used to PROPOSE!!!!!!
fucking comic sans.
I dont think i ever laughed this hard at original youtube content. That haircut killllled me.
2:34 HUEGGGGH
This is the best H3H3 ever made
" IS THIS A BOWL CUT OR A BROCCOLI CUT?? I DONT FEEL LIKE A GAME ASSASSIN. " h3h3 2015

MY FAVOURITE QUOTE
oh fuck at 10:05 i got hella scared
5:49 "Yo hold up my computers frozen"
3:33
yo that cut is tight tho
I actually got to meet that guy
Absolute masterpiece
This is like reverse infomercial, as seen on tv, advert.
There's a ring on the baby wipes though
when you watch this thinking that the product is shit then you realise that you own a bottle of dust off
10/10 would fap to again
This is literally your best video ethan. This is seriously the only thing I've ever come across in my whole life that just didn't get old and gave me the same reaction every time lol. Timeless classic, yt history, papa bless.
this vid gets me hype as fuck to go kill noobs so I'm going to go to the internet cafe to pwn some thx broc sass
why7 clean  an optical drive  when all games  are done digitaly really  shows how disconected marketers  are
blush
No one plays on a mac for gaming!? 8:49
after a little bit you kinda start to hate the cringy guy
mgod
he looks like a reptile
Impossible not to cringe to that Dust Off Vid. You could swear it was produced in 1991
summary:it hurts
4:00 i think she did really good :)
Still love all your videos, but none make me crack up like watching this one again and again!
Such an unsung classic
first h3h3 video I ever watched,still makes me laugh,#papabless
Sigh these ads make us gamers look fucking 2 but hey that's a stereotype (original joke 2016 XD)
This video was uploaded 1 year ago today.
we have the same keyboard
9:58 - 10:06  i got a legit jumpscare using a headset.
2:41
you slightly remind me of tim heidecker in this video
Really.
im crying of cringe....uuuuuuuaaaaaAAAAAHHHHH!!
his bowlcut failed because of his jewfro
never cringed this hard
I dont know what this guy is talking about. My keyboard is full of semen and cheeto dust and Im still goin level to level
Its the one year anniversary for this video
its been a fucking year
One year later and this is still hilarious.
One year today since Ethan shook the world with the power of his Gamer Gear.
That was spooky
When he said the good stuff I thought he meant cocaine
30 SECOND UNSKIPABLE VIDEO>>> I DO THIS FOR YOU ETHAN
One year later and still keeping it clean!!
at 4:01 that hair though
why u making fun of this guy
O my god I'm crying
broccoli cut
Oh sweet jesus, when the giggling kicked in I thought there  was some sort of alien, demonic gamer cringe child behind me or osme shit.
this "gamer guy" tried beyond hard to be funny, wtf
this is cringe af
that part about the gigling thing scared the shit out off me because I'm watching this at knight
#helpdcigs
how tf are you suppose to open the CD rom if it is off?
Gamer air- breathe the game!
I wish 0:27 was an animated gif.
6:26
hahahahah fucking coincidence "JK " clean on  the keyboard after that sarcastic line
I think that might be the cringiest shit I've ever seen, cringe challenges are absolute garbage compared to this
ITS LISPYJIMMY OH CRAP.
Cringe game is too strong
that guy gave me cancer
That is ladies and terminators
The [as] of YouTube
really!
When Ethan has short hair he looks really hard core
What a scrub I bet he doesn't even drink gaming fuel
I actually struggle to watch this video from the amount of cringe that advert gives me
This is still my favorite video
Can someone make a 10 hr loop of ethan gargling the water? XD
IM NOT A GAME ASSASSIN IM A BROCCOLI ASSASSIN
HAHAHA! It's been almost a year now, and I still laugh my buttcheeks off with this video.. AND GUYS, Go check out Michael Tomasetti's (the Gamer Guy) channel at "Gamer Guy and the Guardians" ... For those who don't know, they released a video about this sometime ago and it's super cool too... So go check it out!
"Fuck me up fam"

I'm going to use that one hahahaha
"Gamer gunk cleaner gingger" made me cry
whats your name on Steam
also, who games on a mac xD
This one is golden
gamer cringe I'll say.
That giggling scared the shit out of me
I was watching them and my friend looked over my shoulder as the intro came in and she said "They're both ugly." I turned around and we legit ended up having a twenty minute conversation about being respectful and shit like that. Love you guys❤️😂😍❤️️
the laughter is terrifying with a headset on
The cut is low 🔑 clean
I don't want to be a gamer anymore :(
He actually looks alright with the broccoli bowl cut lol
He looks like Ross O'Donovan without the accent
Just fuck me up fam 😂😂😂😂😂😂
hahaha this is easily the top five of their videos.  so good
You dont win. Expect the unexpected
"Brocoli Assassin" haha i choked on my water
4:45 omg I'm dead
When he got his broccoli hair cut 😂😂 I'm crying
Just realized my new life goal. I want Ethan to randomly notice me and go on a tangent about my desperately wanting to have sex.
If your broccoli assassin, sub to my channel!
Ehh bouse
the dirtiness of h3h3's keyboard and mouse hurt me inside
im not kidding it literally hurt
When ethan was pretending to play the accordion without his keyboard, he looked like an italian mafia boss
😂the haircut
Might as well hang my self now.
Really?
I lost it when he said Mr. On the spectrum.
Eeeewww why the fuck is his neck so long😂he's so fucking ugly
What's a Gay Merssassin and how do I get to be one?
this was so hard to watch
its just a add that's gonea suck
Not a bowl cut. A Sam pepper cut
Does Ethan play DOTA though?
Thanks Mr On-the-spectrum
lol, as soon as you said comic sans,I realized that I had comic sans as the font for subtitles lol
8:15 omfg this dude is insane
8:49 reminds me of old STAR_ videos
I just now realized how much much I miss that H3H3 intro.
Kek
R E A L L Y
REALLY??
Ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ
The broccoli assassin is just normal now in 2016
I have surround sound headphones and speakers and I got super freaked out at the laughing part
Crash and burn! OH NO! burns alive
O F F
The fuck.. one of those giggles sounded so weird, like someone was actually standing behind me. Gave me the fucking chills.
Hilla: "Okay, so how do I do it"?
Ethan: "Just fuck me up". "Just fuck me up fam".
LMAO that exchange of dialoge was too funny for me. 😂
His hair looks like Gambit from X-Men.😂😂
That Guitar Hero guitar though
Wow ethan bradberry cut
heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy that's pretty good
10:25 that's how I play professional counter strike
O F F
is this howtobasic
how do you open the optical drive if the powers off?
"Thanks Mr. Onthespectrum" that caught me off guard
She likes my greasy sticky slimy game residue.
I miss this intro
They're trying to make jokes so the so called "Gamer Samurai hitler Ninja Cock slicer Assasins" Could say MOM FUUUUUUUUUUUUCK I NEED THIS EVEN THOUGH ITS MORE COSTY THAN PIZZA!
A true h3h3 classic.
you should have kept that clean cut, son.
I sincerely wish I was cool as you. Honestly
I can't believe we regard these videos as classics, when this was under a year ago. So much has changed in the H3H3sphere.
nice auto sniper fagget
I've been gaming since I was 4 it's a big part of who I am and this guy is repulsive and a virgin for life. This is what they depict all gamers as.
"Thanks Mr. On The Spectrum." I'm dead😂😂😂😂
cringe crimes
This is your best work. This isnt a joke I died laughing MORE THAN ONCE NIGGER
R e e l l I y y
I'm done 8:17
Bro you use the app to get subs +h3h3Productions lol i saw u
Ethan looking like he's coming out of Jersey
Grab your keyboard like your gone grab her by the pussy.
Yo we got the same monitor my dudet
This dude looks like fuckin Nathan "Freddy Benson" Krest. Holy shit.
"To be a gayness and he'll get the ball get the ball he loves!" -Google Autocaptions @ 3:03.
Wow, the guy they're mocking looks so much like Noel Gallagher I'm surprised they didn't even mention it. 

"In a world, without Oasis..."
ur mom cleaned my gamer gear.





xddd
I have the same keyboard as the one he dumped cheese on.
B R O C C O L I
I like Ethan

He tells the truths about stupid youtubers
D O B R E   G E J M I N G O W E
This is tied with "When texting turns to sexting" for my favorite video ever.
I won't lie, this is definitely me when I'm gaming.
Kys plz.
Internalised Oppression
rip keyboard
the end result when you bowl cut a jewfro.
The Sam Pepper is a good look for you Ethan. Gotta admit.
bro, he fucked up his hair, his keyboard and his mouse just for this vid! lol
I have the same monitor
:D
10:47 daaammmnnn. that kiss tho
Have u seen his gummy rat video reaction,its hilarious 😅😅😅
Aren't you supposed to UNPLUG your PC & let it sit for 10 or 15 minutes before you go poking around in there? Thanks a lot, Mr. Safety.
when did Shaggy play games?
you're amazing, just discovered your channel.... subbed!!! :D
lol
5:07 in 5th grade we had to write and essay and the required font was comic sans.
I love his little giggle when he is fucking up his keyboard.
Best video on youtube 10/10
REALLY
I watched this while I was on the toilet and when I heard that giggle I shitted so hard I cracked my toilet bowl
10:02 am i tripping?
false advertising, said it cleans gamer gear but the screen was clearly a mac
lol
Why is hila always staring into my souls asshole?
Mr Spectrum had laughing so hard
That moment when you realize that you have the same chassis as Ethan
O H R E A L L Y ! ! !
i hate being called a dudette. i thought we were past this stage in friendship.
how do 3000 ppl dislike this wtf. are 3000 people coming to this video and seeing it and saying "FUCK THIS IM A TRUE GAMER ASSASSIN DUDE" i dont understand this is clearly meme af
slicc
dude at 10:06 I was wearing headphones and it creeped me out because it sounded like it was coming from the outside of my headphones
could have sworn 2ne1-fire was gonna play at 5:10
Everyone knows fashion assassinates noobs like ezpzpk mode.
h3 looks like sam peeper with that bowl cut
fuck piss dick shit! I almost pissed myself because of your haircut!
Best commercial ever
6:11

Why would you ruin your desk and keyboard for a video?


It's time to stop Ethan
can relate to the part where it tells you to insert the disc and im just like... we are gamers we dont spend money on disc readers.
REELY
its so funny because theres a tai lopez ad about his house on this video.
I still laugh at Michelle Obama's shout out for Ethan. I still will in a hundred years.
The gamer water is just pure 

A E S T H E T I C
The only thing that's bad about this commercial was the presence of a Nintendo Wii.
8:19 CRINGEEE NOOOO PLEASE NOOOO!
7:49 who heard still dre by dr dre
Gamer air comes in a smaller can, so it cost more than double.
My keyboard is a cheap chinese knock off of the one ethan poured chip dip into...

feelsbadman
the laughter scared the heck out of me XD
These are really good tips and tools to use when I spill my mountain dew and nanchos all over my keyboard and when i shit on it too :)
o h,  t h e  g a m e s  w e  p l a y.
Dude's gon be a meme I'm telling ya
You can't just react to a video like that, YOU'RE STEALING FROM THE FINE BROTHERS
Holly shit Ethan this is gold I laughed so hard while watching this on the toilet I laughed my shit out
You're so fucking hilarious
I couldn't breathe at the "REALLY!!"s 😂😂😂
can i fuck Hila
Ethan has a jewfro
His hair wouldnt look that bad if she didnt shave the front😂😂😂
how many cans of dustoff did this kid inhale before he did this promo? haha
Why is he using an auto, wtf
One word "cringe"
They tell you to turn the computer completely OFF, and then to play a CD in it. R-R-R-R-Really.gifv
Reminds me of the guy who plays the flash on CW
fuckin freaked me out maannn... really?!
I was watching this video on my TV and the sound at 10:00 scared the mess out of me! I thought it was someone outside my window making that noise!
r e a l l y
No, not really.
5:52 It hurts...
5:00 that's my actual keyboard. I'm insulted. It serves its purpose better than any keyboard within the 10-20$ range for only 8$. Ethan plz
I'm getting heart disease for watching this schizophrenic act. Goddamn it hurts >~<
I laughed my ass off so much! But the end creeped me out like wtf
rip. died of laughter when you sprayed the duster upside down
5 mill holy shit
"game assassins"
this actually hurt to watch
my bleach drank itself😑
These type of h3h3 videos need to come back
Its like Shaggy and Skreech had a preemie love child.

This was the first ever h3h3Productions video I watched and to this day, I'm still disappointed in h3h3Productions for not leaving a link to Gamer Water in description.
"Gamer gear glasses - Help you see the game" HAHAHAHA
IM A FUCKING GAME ASSASIN
that keyboard made me vomit alittle
I saw this video and never stop laughing
can we get a DIY Gamer Water™?
the cringe!! the cringe!!
They should make a Game themed chip dip, called GamerGunk. Only problem main ingredients are cheetos dust and semen
My controller is still clean af after two years
i rate that video 5cps (cringe per second)
I always saw this dude dancing in cringe compilations and didn't know who he was until a week ago when I saw him on Worldstar exposing Joey AssNads.. I am very satisfied with this discovery. Fucking hilarious
HOW is this so funny I just coughed hiccuped and farted in a row at that peanut butter part
6:22 
I would LOVE to be BigDaddyWooWoo at that moment.
if she didn't go like 3 inches above his hairline the cut would've looked okay
First h3 video I ever watched. Memories...
This is one of my favorite videos.  "Thanks Mr. On the Spectrum" HAHA

I laughed so much my insides hurt, I seriously don't remember the last time I have laughed so hard
When he started pouring nacho cheese and doritos all over his keyboard I was dying.
You guys do the best edits, The teeth and eye thing -- Brilliant ....Lmao.
His neck is long
Filthy franks better brother
THE CHIP DIP GETS ME EVERY TIME!!
I showed this to my new girlfriend and she legit threw up



HAHAHAHAHAH
You funny cunt

broccoli assasian... omg dood i died
DUDE! being a game assassin is so EPIC! I'm gonna buy these products so I can show my friends on reddit that I'm a game assassin! shwoo shwoo (it's the sound of my game daggers slicing through the air)
I love how hes playing CS
10:00 really freaked me out xD I was alone in my house and the laughing sounded like it was coming from behind me. ;v;
who is bigdaddywoowoo
You two are the sexiest fucking couple in the universe, all alternate timelines, dimensions, and realities. Please stop. Your sex appeal is triggering me.
And what point do people look at their own product and think, "This kinda sucks."
The cringe is strong with this one......... 


hmmmmmmmmmm
Aziz Ansari
I feel bad for this guy... that is the guy Ethan is reacting to
his neck so long it's a 5$ cab fee from his chin to his chest
this guy looks like sid the sloth
R E A L L Y !!!
Succ
ok but forreal that haircut was dope
The 'mom would be so proud' part made me throw up in my mouth a little.
the guy looks like he has fucking down syndrome
Were you kidding about the fact that you are a virgin?
"oh the games people play" wtf does that mean what games sex simulator 3.0?
he didn't really deserve this
That poor fucking keyboard
Who the fuck was that guy. I feel like he doesn't even exist
Back when the channel was amazing
That gamer video is one of the only videos I can watch hundreds of times and still have the same cringe effect
His broccoli cut would actually be sick, if that piece in the front got cut up
All time favorite video
REALLY
Nice quadruple chin :D!
"Thanks Mr. On The Spectrum" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I lost it and LAWLED at 03:41!
I've got the very same cheap ass keyboard. :D
"covered in Sploosh" 
im dying xD
I'm probably the only one who liked his broccoli haircut.
gamer gear hahahahaha srsly FUCK GAMER RELATED MERCH
Put the jewish mail order bride on more often I like watching her pretend to like living with you.
Just turn your computer off, then put in the disk and listen to it giggle...
Sam Pepper at 3:43
This guys eyes clearly show that this is the good stuff
Fuuuck that bit at the end was too creepy. I'm watching this at night, in my room, with all the lights off. And all I hear is some high pitched laugher (ok), and then this really deep, creepy, demonic giggle in the backround. (Not OK.)
fucking air raid sirens! i thought i was getting toned out. fucking startled me
I REALLY(?) like how the cs:go zoom in said "Rias Gremory joining the Terrorist force." HIGH SCHOOL DXD!!!!!!
Does anyone know how he got the video of Michelle Obama?
Never knew giraffes could talk..
i thought right at the end there would be another REALLY
"Thanks Mr. on the spectrum."  So fucking good haha
I would like to see him and Adebisi from Oz in a cell for a couple of nights
this is such a harmless cringe reaction video. It's talking shit about pure cringe and not anything sensitive. They dont get much hate and we get our reaction vids, everyone's happy. I wish there were more cringelords like these making videos.
omg how shall i sleep now? O.o
by far the best h3h3 video😂 keeps me laughing, still after 15times seeing it
pls be more responsible h3h3! this much cringe in one video is not safe for novice viewers!
wait..... wtf was that spraying out at 6:00? those dusters are supposed to dust not soak your electronics in whatever that is....
this is one of the best h3h3 videos in history.
I've never seen a human resemble a camel so closely before
4:51 i cri ertym
after the haircut he looked like that one gay guy in buzzfeed
Not sure why, but Comic Sans Warning had me haha
"No"
This is one of your best videos man. I had to stop the video so I could finish my food.
YOU ARE JUST AS CRINGE  AS HIM
I CANNOT STOP LAUGHING AT THE BROCCOLI HAIRCUT ASSASSIN 😂😂
This is still probably the best h3h3 video ever to come out
Clean your gamer gunk gamer genger to clean your gamer gunk.
Still his best video. never gets old lolol
rip keyboard
2:19 Is this sound Hila's voice or a sond of a fart?
This is the first h3 vid I ever saw it is just too good haha
too much cringe
BROCCOLLI HEAD
2:08 most simple yet hilarious edit.
ethan looked way fresh with that broc cut
Just fuck me up, fam.
The intro! Gamer water...gamer glasses? "Help you see the game..." "This water is pulsing with energy." I'm dead.

If you turn on the swedish subtitles it says that Ethan drinks water like a normal person XD
Thumbs up for the broccoli cut!
react=cringe
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH !! (Insert your sentence here)
The second he starts getting the hair cut on the front... OMFG I CANT BREATH!
I feel like you can get autism just from watching that guy do the dust off promotion
You can tell the guys at gamer gear  know nothing about gaming,when the guy in their  Ad used game gear cleaning stuff  to clean an iMac. 8:47
3:44 LMFAO
Shit who else wants a broccoli cut?
assassinate all the broccoli
I thought he said he was loose in a noose everyday at the beginning. I'm dumb.
Hugh Mungus, WHAT?

Does anyone else think the haircut actually looks good
Omg the stuff he does for utube

The csgo is a nice touch
virginity level over 9000
gamer gunk.
i think i died at 8:53
Cringe man looks kinda like the [10] guy
that was rly painfull to watch when he fucked up the keyboard and mouse with cheese
H3 do a reaction video to your own content
It's cheaper to get a new keyboard. The one he's using is about $4.
Your keyboard isn't covered in chip dip and splooge? Oh, oh well you're not a real gamer.
Like please
this is a fantastic video
4:51
Just buy a logitech water proof keyboard.
But i like to do it dirty.
#BroccoliAssassins
THE HAIR CUT ITS TOO MUCH BAHAHAHHA

Lmao looked like you're planning to join Jersey Shore

I actually felt a piece of me die when he spilled the cheese on his keyboard. That is, if there was anything left after seeing the video he was reacting to.
Jesus, I thought you guys messed with the thumbnail.  NOPE, dude must have worn those neck rings like the padaung tribe.
That tool looks like Joffrey
This & the Papa John's video are the best videos you've made hands down. Like if you agree.
This dude in the video is literally one of the cringiest dudes ive ever seen..... they musta paid him a LOT to do that or he's a moron
what's Ethan's favorite kind of bottle?

Compressed air cans don’t do jack when I try to clean out my PC tower with them. I say, just buy a small electric air compressor and save yourself some money in the long run.

eehm, i might be blind, but the screen he is cleaning is a fking iMac.. Need the GAMER cleaning wipe to clean my iMac and THEN clean my computer, cuz i use the iMac as a monitor for my PC.
"Thanks Mr. on the spectrum" im dead hahahaha
I was looking up the lolyou collab and I found this
Well... NAVI. Nothing beats cloud9
THE CRINGE IS REAL! STOP IT!!!
I don't think that without you is possible to see such a cringy video from the beginning to the end. Thank you dude (and dudette)
OMG HE LOOKS LIKE ERIC BANA. fucking hell

the gamer air is so powerful it blasts the cheese off a dorito
B R O C C L I

6:21 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
1:44 "FUCK! You, you led me on dude! You were smiling and shit when I was calling you a dudette! Fuck you, Hila. You were leading me on, dude."

Warning guys, there is some serious hardcore NSFL stuff at 4:50. I had to get PTSD therapy after watching that.
when the giggling started playing I fucking saw teemo under my bed
so happy to be clean
That guy made a response video it's pretty funny.
I just want to hit him in the face.. not because i don't like him... i just want him to stfu. rly knocking him out would help him
I'm so embarrassed for him.
6:06 This is exactly what I imagine my AFK teammates are doing.
"Thanks Mr on the spectrum!"
Anyone else think this guy looks like an American Ross from Game Grumps?
...Has all the naîvété of a 35-year-old youth pastor.
He looks like a Oblivion character I made with the eyes slider set to maximum wide

The moment he showed his new haircut I cried
So fucking hilarious.  One of my favorite episodes.  Thank so much for the entertainment.  You and Hila fucking rule!!!!!!
Not gonna lie this is definitely me when im gaming.....
Fuck me up, just fuck me up fam!
I love Ethan's giggle when he is freezing all the gamer gunk
Shit, I think I overdosed on cringe.
Trump's wall can fit between that guy's eyes
6:10 till rest of cringe made me laugh abnormally hard
It's 12 o clock and I'm laughing and I think my parents can hear
COMIC SANS WARNING LOLLL

I love how the jk was cleaned out perfectly xD
3:54 every swag fags hair cut
this guy is fucking scary for some reason....he gave me the demon vibes

That guy, is the cringiest thing I have EVER seen. "Hello dudes and Dudettes."
REALLY
That ending😂😂😂😂
lmao i fucking love this
Great job Ethan, keep up the good work. proud of you!
The commitment that went into this video is mad.
boulcut=views
5:55 "And that's how you use gamer gunk k-... cleaner ginger to clean your gamer gunk" lol.
What really bothers me about these videos is the intros and the fact that ethan walks in frame and blocks hila, other than that this is one of my favorite youtube channels :D
Oh the games people play...REALLY
I just came here for the REALILILILILILILYYY
lol he's like 28 and he has grey hair
His neck is nice, it is perfect for my blade. Just slide till its wide open and the blood spills out like vomit.
Make sure your computer of OFF. Now open the disk drive and follow the audio instructions...hmmmm...
the only good reaction channel
lol h3h3 started the fuckboy brocoli hair trend!!
Funny thing is, that disgusting cut he got became a trend in Britain only a few months later.
Wait a minute! At 7:01 HE HAS THE SAME KEYBOARD I DO. The Logitech K120. :O
Thought it was Kenny Hotz in the opening scene
the giggling with surround sound is too realistic
i shit myself
Anyone else think that ethan himself is basically a meme these days
I miss the old Ethan :(
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
idk whats cringier... the actual video or this video lol
she has accent that's hot
"Duddette" Did he just assume my gender
9:47 "Thanks Mr. OnTheSpectrum!" 

Dead.
This killed me xD xD xD
5:40 it actually works! Give the man some credit....
Dude in the past 24 hours I have binged watched h3h3  this dude is a genius!
i wass listening and those monkey laughs sounded like they were off the screen. i almost shit myself
4:51

Welcome.
lol I have that keyboard
what you want?
Just fuck me up, fuck me up fam

m e m e s
One of the last times h3h3 was good.  They just got ...different after this.  Their format or humor or something changed, and it just isn't funny like this was.
Why did the bowl cut not look that bad
I lost it at "thanks mr. On-The-Spectrum"
I have that exact keyboard that he fucked up
make sure your computer is switched offffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
whats wrong with that hair? thats exactly what kids pay top dollar to look like at the barbershop. Just trim the sides to get that proper sewer rat look
I try'd killing my self because my computer laughed at me
I weep for that keyboard.
After using Gamer Gear to clean my gamer gunk, I've never been more pleasured. I'm happy Gamer Gear could pay for an expert like this to show me how to really rub one out for my gear. Watching my gunky gamer junk become germ free; as I rub it raw, what a rush. Really brings out the true torque in my cleaner gienger gamer stuff. Thanks.
Why did I just get a notification for this
cant you get high of duster? XD
The correct term is Dudine. Fucking plebs, they don't even know how to grammatically correctly write sentences. White cis male trash, how dare you assume I don't know how to correctly write sentences. Fuck you.
T R I G G E R E D.
His neck tho
He looks like kraimer
I love how two of the peripherals used in the video were a Mac monitor and a cheap membrane keyboard. Combine that with the horrid "gaming jokes" and it's quite clear that the people making the ad know literally NOTHING about video games and the people that play them.
@00:19 till 00:36...
Man I need that Gamer Water
I keep coming back ..... REALLY
4:29 I burst out laughing at that every time xD
waste of a perfectly good keyboard
7:15 It actually worked! LOL!
Is this the dude from The Flash on Netflix????
screams THE CRINGE IS TOO STRONG AHHHHHHH dies
He looks like sam pepper with that bowl haircut...XD
ｒ　ｅ　ａ　ｌ　ｌ　ｙ
As a gamer I do get kinda insulted by how stupid  and nerdy these people think we are.
yllearreally
No more giggles
5:55.Welcome
i love it when he leans toward the monitor and screams at it xd
Ur ugly

Your hair is actually pretty nice. I have really weak and straight hair, so when it gets longs I just get frustrated. Fucking white genes 😂. If she didn't fuck up your hair line, your hair would actually look dope as fuck!
3:05 killed me

he looks like sid from ice age
This is so dumb... I hope no gamer is dumb enough to but this crap
Those DotA and Na'Vi stickers on the glasses LMAO
Ethan should come back to reaction videos.
He reminds me of Jake baldino or however you spell it from game spot
Do a video about buzzfeed

we have the same computer case, i feel like a giggling hard drive
Reeeeeaaaallllllyyyyyy!
0:26
My keyboard breaks daily because I'm constantly jerking off vigorously on one monitor while gaming hardcore in Call of Duty: Game Assassin GOTY so it's obviously full of hot creamy loads. In between jerk seshes I like to bathe myself in Marshmallow Fluff and French Onion Dip so some of that gets in - it's just so inconvenient! Being a gamer is hard! Thankfully, I think I can go pro because I pwn the noobs.
8:48 is that a fucking mac? IS THAT A MAC? you sure are a pro gamer
REALLY
See Ethan has curly hair that stands up it only works with straight hair guys or girls
Dude your "Gaming gear" you use is exactly what I am using in my setup i.e. : mouse,keyboard, and monitor.
I was headphones an the giggles scared me so hard
0 to 0:31 got me too good lmao!!
dicks out for haramabe
the fucking "finish him" was too much
How could you do that to gamer gear? 

It's high-quality stuff.

I've started to enjoy this channel
WAIT IF THE COMPUTER IS TURNED OFF HOW THE FUCK DOES THE DISK WORK? ITS A SCAM!

LMFAO THIS VIDEO HAS ME DYING
YouTube dudes, and dudettes. When it comes to keeping your video gear at peak performance, oh the videos people watch, I'll tell ya. REALLY! A lotta you binge-assassins seem to think that resolution alone will get you into to the victory lane, as you go leaping from second to second, minute to minute, and HOUR TO HOUR, with little to no effort. Oh, Internet Rangers, do you want to know a dirty little secret? Do ya, do ya? You're not gonna get there if your gear's all crapped up with Youtuber gunk, dust, chip dip, greasy, sticky, slimy YouTube residue! It's a fact! Dirty gear doesn't perform as well as clean gear, and may even crash, or BURN!! OOOOOHHHH NOOOO!!!!!!! You can't do it dirty. You gotta do it meme. And here's how. This stuff, this stuff here,  right here, this is the good stuff! The right stuff! The dust-off stuff! The only stuff you should use fix your gear! First, 'cause it works, duh. Second, 'cause when used properly, it's safe. And third, 'cause it's the best stuff out
wow you actually bought it, props bro
Then wipe your ass with it cause it's a fuckin baby wipe
This is the living Sid m8's
That's the dude from the flash right?
Not sure to like or dislike video, dude cringe the hell outta me :O
10:03 that dark laugh sound like it came from my window and it creeped me the fuck out. let me know if you hear it. i thought it was a dog
I don't know what's funnier but I laughed the most at 4:50
and 5:49

Isn't the computer off when it's in hibernation mode? I mean all that mode does is save data from the computer's memory onto your HDD or SSD O.o

Is that barry allen? (The flash)
"chip dip, gamer gunk, sticky slimy greasy gamer residue" 0_o
Lmao I call girls dudettes.
After rewatching this for a few times, I realised the guy in the video looks similar to Ross O'Donovan from Game Grumps and it honestly scares me.
"Thank you Mr. On The Spectrum"
This guy is the Lord of Cringe. He owns it. It's his domain. Every five seconds he unleashes cringe. I barely survived.
I'm so stoked I found this channel
that Really party should have his own video
holy fuck, what a dank memester. recreating my favorite meme there at 3:04
the scary part comes AFTER the mom part? XD
ethan u r faggot u don't ever real gamer. thes guye is pr0 l33t gamer and beater than u
You taught me how to cringe.
I've just seen the last part while high. I don't want to see it anymore. it will haunt my dreams.
You can't do it clean. You gotta do it dirty.
These reaction videos remind me of idubbbzs' kickstarter crap
just fuck me up fam. 

r e a l l y
Really
Dude is a gender neutral term so dudette isn't a word.
you can use a fucking KFC napkin to clean your computer screen better then this shit
You need old Ian from Smosh to help Hila cut your bowl cut.
That random ass "REALLY"
Yooooo that cut looks bombin dude.
Am I the only one that cringed because he was using an auto in csgo??
Gamer dudes, dudettes. When it comes to keep your gamer gear at peak performance, oh the games people play. REALLY. A lot of you game assassins seem to think that skill alone is gonna get you to the victory lane, as you go leaping from level to level, room to room, and world to world! With little or no effort. Ooooooh planet rangers, you wanna know one little dirty secret? Yeah-huh do ya? You're not gonna get there if your gear's all crapped up with gamer gunk. Dust. Chip dip. Greasy sticker slimy game residue! It's a fact! Dirty gear doesn't perform as well as clean gear, and may even crash, and burn! OH NOO! UGHHH! You can't do it dirty, you gotta do it clean, and here's how. This stuff, right here, this stuff!? This is the good stuff, the right stuff, the Dust Off® stuff. The only stuff you should use to clean your gear. First, because it works, duh. Second because when used properly it’s completely safe. And third, cause it’s the best stuff out there. According to experts, like me! Let’s get cleaning. Now, the keyboard. Grab it sideways kinda like you’re gonna play an accordion. Grab your Dust Off Gamer Gear® duster from your gamer kit, and holding the can upright spraying short bursts as you work your way around all those nooks and crannies. Oh man! Just look at all that crap flying outta there. There must’ve been an entire bowl of cereal down there, and uh enough skin fragments to clone yourself. When you’re done spraying, take a swab for the tiny places, and then take this Dust Off Gaming Gear® wipe and wipe off the top, the front, the back and the sides so you kill all those nasty germs. KILL THEM ALL! PSHEW PSHEW PSHEW PSHEW PBBBBB. FINISH HIM. Keyboard is done baby! Now the mouse. Same drill as the keyboard. Hold the Dust Off® LCD spray, give it a spray, then a good wipe-down with the Dust Off Game Gear® swab and wipe. And you’re all set. You may be saying you can skip this step because you have one of those cool laser meeces. Lasers need to be cleaned too, so you’re not off the hook on that one. Next, we move onto the screen. For this step, we have a specially formulated Dust Off® screen spray and Dust Off® shammy. And let me tell you folks, it is not a paper towel and window cleaner. It is not that. It’s totally safe for the screen and for you! Spray it one like this, wipe it off like this! And you’re all set. Oh and uh you can spray on the acrylic parts too so they’re nice and shiny. Mom would be so proud. Now, for the scary part! THE COMPUTER! It’s definitely worth another reminder from Mr. Safety. “Now make sure, the entire computer is off. Not hibernatin’ or sleepin’. But completely O. F. F. Off.” Thanks Mr. Safety. CPUs have just a couple of screws. You can unscrew when you unscrew the housing, your manual, assuming you didn’t throw it away like I did, uh will show you how to do it. Carefully remove the housing and, IT’S ALIVE! Welcome to the inner sectom. This isn’t so scary. We’re not even gonna touch anything. Grab your Dust Off Gaming® duster, and blowing from the inside out, very important, inside out, spray the fan. Then, spray the motherboard, and other components. Do not use a leaf blower! VOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Do not use a vacuum! VOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Vacuums can cause static discharge and could severely damage your computer. When we are done, replace the housing and we’re just about finished. The last part of the cleaning does require that the computer be turned on, so turn that baby on man! soft rock “Listen to that baby hum”. Now, we’re gonna clean the optics of your CD, DVD, and Blue-ray player. Using this special formulated Dust Off® cleaning disk, open the tray, slide it in ;). And follow the audio instructions. If you hear closely, you can hear giggling coming from the player, it’s so happy to be cleaned. That’s it ladies and terminators. So remember, before you get your game on, get your clean on Gamer Gear Dust Off®. Keep it clean, keep it new, keep it Dust Off®, for gaming.
"REALLY"
I just went through every comment proof ? it only goes to. June 14
He poured nacho cheese and Doritos on the same model of keyboard and mouse I have.

That guy must be good at deep throating BBC

Just fuck me up fam lol
hilarious!
Damn it, i thought this would've gotten rid of the cat on my keyboard.

BROCCOLI CUTS AND BUSTIN NUTS
HOWD HE GROW HIS HAIR BACK😂😂
My sides completely detached themselves and are now orbiting Mars.  This video was hilarious.
Ethan literally lets his hair grow just to cut it in the most ridiculous way posible. That's commitment to comedy.
This is why anything involving video games off the internet sucks D
isnt that "bitterswert symphony" guy? looks like he lose all the money paying the people his shoulders beat
4:00 the fuckboy haircut looks good on you Ethan!
This is a classic h3 video.

6:26 "My gaming gear has never been cleaner!"  (camera zooms in on J K)

Ethan, Hila, if that was intentional, you deserve a goddamn trophy. Brilliant!
REALLY

insults someone by calling them autistic, gets mad at people for making fun of autistic people haha

Omg when Ethan grabbed the keyboard like an accordion I realized I HAVE THAT EXCAT KEYBOARD!
That dude isnt just a game assassin hes a pootang assassin too. As in he kills any chance to get any.
the cringe in this one is too strong !!!!
cringe
10:00 too high 0_0
I cringed hard when you destroyed the keyboard with goop...I can't...
This reminds me of Tim and Eric
but im on a laptop  
gg
lmfao! the lengths he goes in his videos.
Is gaming a sport. Some people think it is. I personally don't think it is. Just want to see what most people think. Lol
If you put subtitles it says bad southern ascent
Comedy on YouTube has gone way up 
H3H3
FilthyFrank 
Pyroxynical
And those are only off the top of my head.
this dude
2:39 did somebody say react
Testing testing. This is just a test
I think this guy nails the average minecraft gamer
Go home gamer girl!
I thought he would say this is how to clean your gamer junk
"gamer gunk cleaner ginnger, to clean your gamer gunk" gets me every time jesus
laughed too much ... man my abs got a workout
Looks kinda like Casey Neistat xD
Just made some shit to this video... go check it out on my profile <3

Bowl cut NOOBZ
the autism joke outta no where caught me off guard xD
Why is there a single dislike on this video
That's my monitor.....
the painting reflects the fucking umbrella-thing for the light
makes me really uncomfortable
I swear that guy is a Sloth.
Oh god this can't be real
P
LOL 2:22 reference from ''5150-games people play''
This dude funny as fuck
"Give me the fucked up broccoli bowl cut son"
"I got you fam"
Gotta love the 80's styled intro lol
Cringe game too strong.
Is it just me but does his intro bother you?
Oh my god I though the dont clone yourself part was edited in...
The cringe is so real.  It is worse than a train wreck.
He looks like Marie from breaking bad.
Times New Roman 12 point font
I am offended that you made a autism spectrum joke. I so happen to be on the autism spectrum and I am very triggered. 








So what I would say if this video wasn't fucking hilarious.
1:57 relly
This is embarrassing...
funny shit but I hope that was a cheap bs mouse and keyboard
At least this vid made more money than the air cost, so you're digging a negative hole.
8:51 The real question is who the hell games on a mac.
Did I just watch an episode of Blues Clues
Ethan is savage😂😂😂😂😂😂
My favorite h3h3 video
any other youtubers like ethan?
I died at the actually gamer on a keyboard
REALLY???
so I'm suppose to turn off the computer, then put in the disk? He's right, the computer part is scary.
I nearly died when he said broccoli assassin
This dude's neck is bigger than my future.
I find it much better to clean my gamer gear the old fashion way, trading it at GameStop for 1/10th its value
The broccoli actually looks pretty good.
broccoli assassin sound yummy :)
This is the kid who shoves a  pencil in his sleeve to act like he's from Assassin's Creed in high school
Lol, Mr. On the spectrum
"Make sure the computer is o-f-f" "next we're going to clean the optical drive" pops the disc in ...WUT? you're supposed to use the force to open the tray then?
First H3H3 video i've seen and I just laughed so hard.
rip keyboard
at 5:55 he was speaking gibberish for a sec. lol
CRINGE
Wait how do I open my dvd drive when my computer is off again?
This is like one of those nightmares you get when you have a fever.
I'm fucking dying lmao
OOOOORIIIIGHT
I have the same computer lol
Even when hila is in any of the vids she always quite as fuck
What happened to Sean?
The fucking glasses lmao
Wtf is gamer gunk 😂😂😂😂
even though it doesn't "REALLY" fit
Omg memories from joels video kill me
8:50 iMac in a gaming commercial? Rip
Fire
The haircut was actually not that bad
"make sure that computer is completely turned off, not hibernating"
DUDE!!! ARE YOU INTO HOW PC WORK AT ALL?
You hibernate PC TO TURN IT FUCKING OFF!
You can't do it dirty gotta do it clean.
2:43 wtf was that noise
This guy is so fucking weird😂😂

Oh the cringe...
Hey Ethan! I just moved to New York for college and I just saw you while I was leaving shake shack. I was that guy who awkwardly waved at you, cause shit, I didn't know what to say xD lol sorry for waving awkwardly at you

I thought this was that Chadtronic video. But then I realized it was h3h3. Was not disappointed.
That intro is so fucking good 
"AAAAAAAAHHHHHH!"
I busted my fucking balls why is this shit so funny
REALLY
4:51 Hila probably wishes she was married to the game assassin, at least he can provide some nice "entertainment"
It is Wednesday my dudettes.
I am such a retard; "h3" stands for "Hila and *3*than."
being a gamer this video saved my gaming gear from being filled with gunk
He turned into Sam Pepper with that haircut
best intro on the fucking internet
REALLY!!
how did he get the na'vi sticker lol i want it too ;D
You should patent that gargling/coughing sound you make.
Watch out ethan you cant react the fine bros will get you
ＲＥＡＬＬＹ
I have the exact same keyboard as the one you filled with "gamer gunk".
Guess what?  SoFloAntonio removed like all of his videos from SoFloComedy!!
0:18-0:30 watched that part 10 times can't stop laughing hahaha xD
god that videos is so cringey I can't even watch H3H3's reaction to it all the way through.
Who else read it as "How To Clean Your Gamer Rear"
3:45 I'm kinda jealous of your thick hair
CRRRIIIIIINGE

My favorite channel today.
Dudet
I happen to own an accordion and found this very relatable.

hahahaha this video made my day 😂😂 legendary!!
when your keyboards so shitty Ethan covers one in cheese
6:13 auto sniper n00b
You actually suit that hair cut
I have aspergers and I laughed my ass off at "thanks mr. on the spectrum"
I don't understand how they only have 1 mil subs
that shit isn't for cleaning look at that frosty ass keyboard, it's clearly for OVERCLOCKING
because I know if I say Logitech gear is just as good as Razor, I'll have to drink gamer bleach so that I get the mlg dying experience.
That guy looks like JC Chasez from Nsync lol
Who the hell can dislike. This
he need some milk
Really
8:57 there thank me later
Just grab out your accordion, like you do.

REALLY! xD
poodlecorp xDD
Subscribe to my channel and I will subscribe back :)
That was a REALLY good video
A random Na' Vi' sticker on the glasses xD
first I was like "hey that's my keyboard cool we use the same keyboard", then I was like its his shitty keyboard for demonstrating other similar shit objects. FeelsBadMan
nice to see Drake from Drake & Josh is doing better
This guy reminds me of sloth from ice age for some reason
hi
I died when he said "What is this a fucking broccoli cut"
6:16 using the auto like a noob ethan. Step up your gamer game
6:01 the game on the computer is csgo :d
hey Ethan could you say happy birthday for my friend dude your garbo that would be great.  it's his birthday tomorrow. if you do thanks man. 😂
"Thanks Mr. OnTheSpectrum"
Oh god i hope they got a new keybord
I'm SO FUCKING DEAD
Every time he messed up the name XD killed me
This is the best stuff.
I like you and I like the shit you are reacting to but I think you are reacting to "much" or to long to some parts bit which sometimes ruins the video for me - so I hate myself for not thinking that is funny but still watch it as I like you...damn I hate myself :D

The nacho keyboard killed me...
4:51 i gagged
Fucking RIP Keyboard
The broccoli cut 😂😂😂 I'm dead
I dont now why, but your videos are the most hilarious videos everrr, keep up the good bloody work xD
I might be missing some gamer assassin knowledge but  why the fuck would you put cereal on your keyboard to begin with?
Is that Matt from Nerd plays in the thumbnail? Or as everyone else knows him as M3rkMusic's Brother
cringe. the whole video.
I have that keyboard...
5:50 WE GET IT YOU VAPE
4:45 wait... I just noticed that I have the same keyboard haha

hahahhahaaha "thanks mr. on the spectrum is the funniest thing i seen this week
Repping Na'Vi lol
Word to my broccoli assassins
Dude funny stuff. i liked it but you need to break the affiliation with buzzfeed. that shit is going to kill you. buzzfeed = cancer. They are all left wing politics that infect the brains of impressionable teens
it annoys me that the people who influence the game industry the most are the ones who have little to no experience with video games
holy shit
I identify as a grade A Terminator 78099
"Introducing a broccoli assasin, fuck me dude" i'm fucking dead
I like the part where hes using the same keyboard as me, mines not full of chip dip but rather tab ash and broken dreams.
press 2 then 7 and then 9
really?
COMIC SANS ALERT GUYS!!!! I fucking fell apart at that part
So fuckin cringe
Really!?!?
ethan plays csgo?
when the laughing part came in it scared the shit outta me... i heard it from the back of my headphones
i think when he says dudetts it decreases his chance by .01
Staples sells this... and people buy it...
This video is photoshoped, don't even trust it, look at his hair all grown after fresh haircut
Love it vids
THANKS MR. ON THE SPECTRUM.

Momboy made me spurt spurt.
Ethan, you definitely seem like the dude from the HowToBasic channel, are you though?
It kills me because every dude now has that stupid fucking broccoli cut.
10:08-10:24 is what people questioning you sounds like on acid
Anyone else cringe seeing him use the mouse with all that cheese on it?
Yo hardhat, needa dispenser 'ere
Thats almost a fuckboi haircut :o
Instructions not clear. Dick caught in disk drive.
10:00 Dude I legit got fucking scared, im using speakers and it sounded like it was coming out my fucking door.
Is he married to hilan or are there brother and sister or just friends
how the fuck did you get ur hair back? xD
really
8:18 erron black
Hahahaha Ethan is so funny xD that face at 2:15
Than has no shame.
You can own me
I like when h3h3 makes videos criticizing people that deserve it, like Sam pepper and his controversial videos, but there is no need to make fun of people like this...I guess whatever pays the rent huh?
0:26
CSGO ?
Rias Gremory joined the Game :D
wtf is a game assassin.. ok i'm late
9:47 OH MY GOD

Look at 5:05, it shoes him before he shaved his hair after he did.
hahahah!
The retch at 2:34 gets me every time.
I love how at 6:30 the 2 keys clearly visible are JK. As to say, just kidding. Maybe it's just a coincidence but I like to believe that Ethan and Hila write elaborate scripts for each of these video's.
You were playing with an auto.
Lel get gud n00b
dude i die every time he dresses up as his mom
anyone else cringing so bad? XDD
Hila cracks me up. I hear her giggling in the background. I'm a bit pissed that you wasted all that salsa con queso, though....
Apparently the glasses are for eye-strain which is a real thing but you can get a free program for your computer that does the same thing. You could also you know take a break after a few hours...
I miss the old intro 😞
look like that dude from the movie "ererser head"
6:10 dak dak scrub
It's sorta sad that the commercial achieved its end goal because he did buy the product.
Influenced by Tim&Eric I think. Great Job!
brocoliiiii
2:38 I'm telling the FineBros on you
DRAMAALERT NEWS: Broccoli Assasin roasts a game cleaner
I cried from laughing when he got the bowl cut 😂
How do people like this? This is so cringe.
Ethan has a prebuilt gaming PC? That's disappointing.
How did you clean you keyboard
Lol
this is the best channel to watch after youre baked😂😂😂
REALLY!???!?!!???!
REALLYYYYYY
ETHAN LOOKED LIKE THE WEEKND AFTER THE HAIRCUT LMAOOO
I get the vibe that Hila doesn't want to be there
I lol'd way too much at this. Epic.
I got cancer from this thanks h3h3
It was hard to watch you do that to a keyboard and mouse
really
He looks like the weekend
This video was brutal, I couldn't stop laughing. Well done sir!
It killed me when he flipped over the duster and blew that all over lol
4:58 joeysworld tour

I love how after he said my gaming gear never been cleaner he shows the keybored n the keys j/k are the only ones cleaned lol good one
Dear h3h3, I'm just a kid and I do not know a lot about lawsuits but just watching bashurverse's video i know that he needs help from FUPA to sue keemstar for what he did to him.
Most retarded yt CHANNEL 8/8 m8
I think this is the best h3h3 video
That haircut after the bowl cut made me fucking die
LOOK I MADE A CLEVER COMMENT ON A SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE TO GET THE WHOLE 2 SUBSCRIBERS I GET FROM BEING THE TOP COMMENT, PLEASE LET THIS COMMENT GET LOST
Really
5:00 perfectly good opportunity missed to be eating ravioli
Can someone explain to me the Michelle Obama thing and where it comes from
> "Gamergear"

Auto using fag.

8:17   C   A   N   C   E   R
Memes are cool.
REALLY????????
i subbed for the comic sans thing. gr8
is your wife behind the camera cause that sounded like a girl lagh
That guy... He looks kinda like Ross. Goddammit Ross.
1:44
The like to dislike ratio on these videos frightens me. I can rarely see a single reason to dislike but for the amount of views he has I'd expect more dislikes
Go to vape con I'll be there
I only came here for the 'really'.
Is that Michelle Obama in the intro?
o.O
I have the same keyboard as me and that triggered me 6:18
Realy?!
the way he says "dude"👌🏻
mister on-the-spectrum's neighborhood
The laughs that this video induced, was the final push needed to help squeeze this shit from my body. Thanks for healing my constipation Ethan. Your like that black guy from the green mile, except without that whole nut squeezing bit.
It is just me or does the whole advert thing sound kind of like it belongs to Sesame Street or some. Kind of kids show? I mean granted it's about selling a product for gamers... But it really sounds like he's trying to teach kids how good the product is. Especially that Mr safety guy.
Btw that's not how you pick an accordion :/
ive watched so many videos from him and the intro kills me every single time
i laughed so fuckin hard at the reallys that were thrown in there randomly
eh... this guy isnt That bad...not as shit as keemstar
Why has god abandoned us?
I need the picture of the "GAMER WATER" banner so I can print it and put it on my water so I can be MLG AND NEVER LOSE TO NOOBS! #GameAssassin #Pro #GamerGunk #GamerGunkGameGameyGamerGAMESGAMING
This video is so fucking funny I've watched it like 10 times atleast hahahaha
it's like a parody of itself what the fuck im so confused
"thanks, mr on the spectrum" im crying
wat, we have the same keyboard
CS:GO - my man
He plays Csgo wtf
xd
that hair cut tho, He looked like Faze Rain for a sec xD
What's that white shit that came out of the duster?
Game assassins.......and he has a wii on his table..............YEAH SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT
Every time I watch this at the Actual Gamer Footage when he covers his keyboard and mouse in chips cheese splughe it makes me laugh so hard
Too cringy why does this shit existt
Is it that pewdiepie guy he's reacting to?
ethan kind of reminds me of kenny hotz in a way
I'm sitting here wondering why that bit with the water made me laugh as hard as it did.
#leafyisfunnier
Comedy gold!
I think shaved sides suits you, Ethan
It's Wednesday my dudets
This will forever be the best reaction video. Respect dude papa bless
not even gona lie, hair looks on point 😂
I feel like that kid would've been a perfect fit with Whitest Kids You Know. He even dressed like a woman.
the broccoli assassin
you know, that one mom jumpscare that makes you grow a double chin
The haircut doesn't lookmhalf bad tho
4:34
сука шлюха задницу пенис влагалище анальный мем изнасилование

Cringe for that guy, cringe for you, cringe for everyone!
How do people watch him? He literally looks like a human diglett

Drinking Coke and watching this made me get gamer gunk all over my keyboard.
Help the Poll!!!

https://twitter.com/KenMathewws/status/745136390036348929
This "Gamer Guy" is a literal walking meme
LMFAO ~1 million of these views are probably mine just for that Gamer Water bit. Shits funny af hahaha
4:50 HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO A KEYBOARD!? Even though it was a joke, it broke my heart when he got chip dip all over his keyboard.
Am I the only one that dances awkwardly when the intro plays?
SHAKE THAT DICK
Ethan is the only thing keeping me from giving into my crippling depression
"And that's how you use gamer gunk c-cleaner ginger."
the game guys misses me
I was fine during the video but 7:42 really got me XD
I'm surprised bitch ass faze logo wasn't on there.
Virginity, I choose you.
8:14 when she tries to take your virginity
BROCCOLI CUT OMG
5:05  TRIGGGERRED !!
hey ethan you missed the fucking part at 1:48 in the original video where he doesnt even get the mouse
Comic sans warning? (Megalovania PTSD flashbacks)
Who else was wearing headphones and thought it was creepy AF when the giggling started.
Gamer gunk cleaner gingger!!
2:31
You look like fuckin Rocky Maivia/The Rock! 😂😂😂
Stop trying to look like a retard so hard.. you started off good already.

I don't know how I went so long without seeing these videos, but my fiance just showed me these while I came down with a bad case of sickness visiting his family in France.

Your memes are lame
Low key, the computer can be hibernating and it would be exactly as safe as turned off, because hibernation means the computers is actually turned off, the only difference is that the RAM is temporarily saved on your hard drive.
There people don't even know what they're talking about..
this faggot is the nicole arbour of gaming. thinks hes funny, so hes gotta be funny right? fuck this asshole.
REALLY
This guy looks like a Mii whose eyes were separated too much.
I never considered that you have to have the right kind of hair for that bowl cut shit to work.  Just like using a Flo-bee.  Your hair would work with that but really, really curly hair wouldn't.
Klein means. awkward in.Norwegian explains a lot
Grab your accordion😂😂😂😂
I have literally watched this video 5 times and I still laugh xD
Cs:go is life

The cringe...its too strong

Next time someone says something really interesting to me I will say 
"REALLY??!?"
Gamer junk
I miss when Ethan was funny like this.

Screwed up intro (no hate to you)
Says he's a gamer, has a Mac a wii and a guitar hero guitar.
Haha REALLY!
when the laughing started it actually scared the shit out of me....
ROTFFL!!!!

Gamer glasses to take a look at the game LMAO
The thumbnail looks like u h3h3 lol
This video is faked giraffes can't talk

everyday we move away from the light of God
these reaction videos got me dead lmao
That giggling scared the crap out of me...
10:04 It was late at night and I had headphones on, When I heard the giggling girl It really scared the shit out of me cause I actually thought some one was laughing behind me.
5:54 "WHY DOESN'T AnYONE GO TO B WITH ME OH MY GAWD"
Ебать Саакашвилли топит

I legitimately don't think I've ever laughed harder. When he took the bowl off his head and revealed the broccoli cut oh my god hahahahaha
That bit with the water bottle fucking kills me every time.
That game assassin looks like his younger brother

omfg i laughed so hard, thank you h3
I never thought I could be offended, but I will be if this is legitimately how stupid they think gamers are.
I don't know.  Kind of a dick move to make this video.  That guy in the commercial hates himself enough for being in it.  All his friends laugh at him and now you guys make a reaction video.  You will be lucky if you don't get sued when he kills himself.  You don't need another law suit.
"thanks Mr. On the Spectrum" 

BWAHAHAHAHAAHHAHA!!!
subbed
LOL H3H3
thanks mr on the spectrum. fuck

the sound at 10:14 is genuinely scary and seems to be happening outside of my headphones. i thought someone was talking in the room. how did you even do that?
Mr Saftey looks like bob the builder lol
He looks like Ethan from LOST.
Mom wouldn't be proud of me. At all.
2:38 oh no Ethan, you shouldn't use that word

'Mr on the spectrum'...howling :D
That gamer fag sounds exactly like Jack Vale
Ha!!  Well done h3h3!!
Rip jewfro.
69-420

All you need to become a gamer is piratebay or any ass source of torrent.
This is probably one of his best videos... dear god my sides
+1 broccoli cut -1 game assassin
I thought it said how to clean a game gear, like a sega game gear.
Man I am so glad Jontron introduced me to this channel
REALLY
That kid has the eyes of an alien and the neck of a llama.
nice vid bro!
Really?
Really
Thanks mister on the spectrum... omg
It definitely was an over 50 exec who wrote that. They would've thought it was so funny too.
How can you claim to be a gamer if you don't bring a 9mm to school for the beta uprising?  What are you a casual?
-Make sure your computer is off
-Insert disk
-Listen to the audio instructions

Yeah I would do that, but in the first bit you told me to make sure my computer was off.
The clone part killed me laughing! HAHAHAHAHHA .
RIP me.
not to be rude or anything but I prefer chadtronic's video on this
another SLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMIN video Ethan and Hila
is Ethan half Hungarian?
0/10 Needs more neckbeards.
baby wipe XD
You have the hairline of a hedgehog.
That keyboard is so fucked lol

that hair cut ........................ LAUGHABLE
where you get these dang glasses
That gamer water lol
5:57 xD
What happened with the buzzfeed video
He looks like a soccer mom in drag
the cheeze freezing on the keyboard is a great highlight of this vid, even though the best parts are the "really" echoes
is it bad that I thought you made the clones of him and that they couldn't have possibly made that lame of a joke in the actual commercial? shit and I thought I was giving them way to little credit. should've known from that really.
Jesus fucking Christ, it was 4 in the morning and I was wearing headphones, on god I thought I was about to be murdered by some fucking demon child when the laughing started
i am crying x'D
Nigga look like a toad
Current Mental State: REALLY!!!
WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY?
this guy looks almost exactly like this one person in my english class
Wow. Great moves Ethan. Keep it up! Soo proud!!
One day Ethan will have sex but not today or tomorrow or the day after that
I've seen this video way too many times
The true broccoli assassin is Brock Lee
Your fucking cancer
A fucking tai lopez ad played on this video

You know h3 eats ass

........................................
I declare a new meme. It shall be known henceforth as a "Really bomb". I bless this meme in the name of the holy papa.
I think most of what u do is super funny but I think ur being a bit mean in this one
This was my first H3H3 video.
This is by far the cringiest shit I've ever seen.
What the fuck is "gamer gunk"?
Guys let's all start disliking h3h3 videos based on the fact he's a JEW!
"It made me, like, react."
I swear in the beginning I woulf always hear "Loosen the noose," instead of "Losing to noobs."
DO A VIDEO ON REACTION TIME
Man Ethan is the American Kenny Hotz
cringe
You can see in the background he is playing CS:GO and getting killed because he´s not moving xD
#WOWETHANGREATMOVESKEEPITUPPROUDOFYOU

I want this Gaming Water sooo much!!!
SCREW THE FREAKING NORMAL LAME WATER!!!
Hila did a great job on that broccoli cut.
Game Assassins XD
I CANT 😂😂
I feel like you could upload 5:36 to 6:32 as its own video entirely and a lot of people would watch it.
...Something also tells me a fair chunk of less-than-intelligent people would take it seriously. At least up until the halfway mark.
JUST
U
S
T
When he gets in drag I get a hard-on <3
Broccoli cut doesn't look half bad
How do you get Michelle Obama to send u a message plz?
4:01 You missed a great chance to say dudette.
Clean the optics of the disc drives when the computer is off... Seems legit.
Guy reminds me of Robby Motz
i'm guessing Barry Allen lost his day job
Can't do it dirty... got to do it clean. Best innuendo before I'm gonna make you cum...over to my house.
"This water is pulsing with energy", my body would never be ready for that
subscribed after I saw 0:27 - 0:30. I`ve been looping that shit over n over ever since...

FFFFUCUUUCXKXKKXKXKCK I JUST HAD A HEART ATTACK!! GOD DAM COMIC SANS.
whoa was that gamer label taped over a regular electronics duster? Fake product review don't listen.
This channel is more cancerous than the gay retard himself.
can't believe you did that to your peripherals lmfao
Auto Sniper Noob
Y that guy look like Sid from ice age
that giggling about made me crap myself. I have on some nice headphones and it sounds like it's coming from 10 feet away
Oh the games people play
I love the intro😂😂
Y was he cleaning his accordion while playing the game???
ethan is a jew tho
for 8 bucks i buy a new keyboard
why is michelle obama proud of ethan?
i actually freaked out at the part where they put the cd disk in! what the fuuuck!!!
I feel bad for the mouse and keyboard.....the screen can atleast be wiped off
I see one of the cringy drama kids from my high school finally got an acting job
So you turn off your computer and you put a disk into it... While it's off?
I feel like Ethan and Hila are Butch and Fabienne from pulp fiction
Your my new favorite youtuber.
REALLY??!!!
your a fake faggot
The laugh at the end sounds legitimately "real" in headphones. I've never heard an attempt at surround audio in headphones that worked that well. Mess with that effect more!
wow this video is REALLY good... badumtss
That giggle made me shit myself
I cant help singing the touch the sky lyrics to your intro
I discovered this channel through Jontron. Now I subscribed
Well, I'm fucking disgusted.
"thanks mr. On the spectrum" hoooooooooooooooooooly shit dude hahahaha
Fuq yah dud
the giggling terrified me, it sounded like a little kid was next to me in the dark
Broccoli cut beats bowl cut on any day of the week
I HAVE THE SAME MOUSEPAD
It is Wednesday my dudettes
That poor keyboard and mouse
The fact that he's using an auto-sniper is the clingiest part.
I have a small oil free air compressor I use to clean out my computer every couple of months (and anything else that needs cleaning), just plug that baby into a power socket and you're good to go.

PSA: Never use a vacuum to clean dust out of your computer unless you want to damage shit.
Home alone that laugh at the end scared the shite outta me
+h3h3productions can you help me out
With the broccoli cut, he looks like Sam Pepper.
I'm gonna get owned by noobs with a cut like this!   lol
going on your channel to give them dislikes on your vids
Is that Ross?
"Thanks Mr. On the spectrum" slayed me
Did anyone else notice that you're supposed to shuttdown your pc and then open the cd player? :D
the cringe is strong in this one... very strong
When you cringe so bad you actually wretch.
So the lanky tryhard who dresses like he's still 12 is what the average gamer is supposed to look like huh.
you're a bully, Pick on someone your size.
Roby motts has really lost it since =3
I've just discovered your channel and I'm laughing so much on every video that I'm crying every time. Thx man I appareciate
Back when Ethan wasn't trying to expose everyone for YouTube views.
really
It's Wednesday my dudetts
Just fuck me up fam
The sound when he sprays the Dorito with air is so satisfying in my earholes 5:41
The video he is talking about is so cringe worthy it feels like it was written by 5 old ass fucking executives that think they know about gaming because they have 5 year olds that play minecraft.
Thanks Mr On The Spectrum 😂
6:56 xD
I have a K70, all I have to do to get the shit out of it is hit it on it's edge and the shit falls out from under the keys. For the screen and the side window of my case, I have a micro fibre cloth and Windex.
so im not supposed to just put my keyboard in the dishwasher with the plates after i finish eating my spaghetti on it?
Your not even funny, it makes me cringe
notice how only the J and K keys are dusted off
He's using an auto. RIP
When British people say "fam" its scummy af. But when Americans say it, I dunno dude.
srsly just get a window cleaner and some micro fiber towels. perfectly fine. hah.
Holy shit i'm dying laughing
I love this guy
God damn he looked like Joey World Tours at 4:58
song name at 6:55 ?
Random navi sticker on glasses
That video is the reason why kids should never visit the internet .-. fucking Gamer Gear my ass.
Great thing I have a you know mechanical keyboard that real GAYMRZ use.
Dude can you make a video on how you met your wife?
lol
rly
I've loved that cringe for a long time. Now I love it even more because it made me discover this channel.

H3h3 production I'm just wondering why did u name yourself on YouTube h3h3 productions
CyberPowerPC ftw!

DIE
Really!
I can watch this video over and over again and laugh every time.
starring ethan BRADBERRY
I love how at 6:28, he says "My house has never been cleaner." and the only clean keys are J and K...
The cheese dip on the keyboard.  I've been triggered.

Go full screen on the video then type "awesome" on your keyboard, then look at your play bar.
sexy k120 bro
comic sans is the best font
Ethan slammin that Moe Bradberry look
Explanation the intro what does it mean game theory help
His reactions are what reactions are supposed to be
This guy has really big bills to pay. Everyone can see that in his motyvation
I've got exactly the same case!
Why that matters I don't know...
but i still wrote this comment so bye i guess
WHY IS THERE A GUITAR?
Dude how is this real
Michel Tomatoresetti is pretty badass!
Yah fuck sheela stupid dudet
Gamer gunk cleaner genger gaging duster clean game dust off gear.

Natus Vincere? Come on man. Fnatic is obvs best.
Wow way to take several years to react to this, loser.

Pretty sure a bowlcut is the haircut of a school assassin, lol
cringe to the max.
Wtf why are you bullying him? Just because he has autism doesn't mean you can do this.

6:09 Ethan's a auto noob, smh
REALLY
at 6:21 , the first time i watched this I thought that said "Germany is joining the terrorist force" I pissed myself laughing considering Hila is a Jew and how concerned she must of been.
'Thanks Mr On-the-spectrum
AHAHAH
Ill take that fucked up keyboard if you still have it. :)
I've only started watching your videos but I already love you! Haha
Ethan and hila related or married
He got that FazeRain gamer hair cut lol 😂😂😂😂
Holy shit those opening 40 seconds XD I'm done.
Every time Ethan fucks up his hair it comes out looking good on him what is this power?
"Thanks Mister On-The-Spectrum." OH MY GOD
The...the video told him to turn the computer off.. O.F.F(f.f.f) Then it told him to put a cd in...
I cried when you sprayed the cheese with the air lol holy fuck
I sometimes say dudette
3:50 sam peppers cousin
"thanks mr on the spectrum"
omg the tactical Rias Gremory is joining the Terrorist Force tactic maneuver
well that's  waste of a keyboard
Is there actually a gamer air? Wtf
That bowl actually looked lit asf, I'm definitely getting that the next time I'm at the barber #nohomo
Help! I feel pain for that keyboard and I don't know why!
he legit had csgo in the background XD
Gamer Gunk is that lint that gets built up right under your stomach.
But Ethan... Are you a true gay assassin? 
I know this Dust Off guy is a gay assassin.
He's on the fucking spectrum!  haha
2:40 Omg i cried when he did that xD
Broccoli haahahahhaha
auto fag 6:14
the dude can actually pull off drag 0.0
Fucking delete your channel lying bastard
8:53 That part was kind of creepy.

Also, REALLY?!
That guy looks like ross
The water part :)
The cringe is soo real.
This dude came out of a nintendo power commercial from the '90s.
Unleash the game assassin in you, and RADICALIZE YOUR EQUIPMENT WITH GAMER AIR!

Compressed air can be used for cleaning the inside of a computer but just because its gaming air is a freaking joke.....

zoinks, scoob our gamer gear is dirty, really.
heh. i have the same keyboard as ethan
That guy should have been in Hackers (1995)
Nice Dumb and Dumber joke.
thanks mr.onthespectrum 😂😂
Holy shit. Was he cleaning a Mac monitor? Mac's aren't for gaming!
god happy i found you +sub
I like how Ethan took four minutes to roast the first 9 seconds of the video.
8:58 this is so cringe that I thought it was make by Ethan to make fun of this video.
Michael Tomasetti gets so much pussy.
That guy is so fucking ugly I get mad
that wasnt comic sans it just looked like comic sans
Really?
I loved this it was funny and I understood this so clearly because I am a gamer myself
"Pick on someone your own size" -h3h3
Sure Ethan cause you always do that 😑.
I wonder if he filed that keyboard as a tax deductible for work purposes.
"Thanks Mr. Safety!"
"Thanks Mr. On the Spectrum."
Jesus Christ man, my sides.
Aaahhh I think one of the reasons hes so cringy is because they were trying to convince 8-12 year olds to cry to their mom to buy this product. You know how awkward that age group is...
Really?
if you're reading this... YOU'VE JUST BEEN PRANKED!!!
i lol'd fucking hard
03:45 When you say you want a rock lee cut, and she gives you a broccoli cut instead...
When that motherfucker said Blu-ray I was shocked as hell! This fucking video wasn't made in the late 90's!?
He reminds me of Tim Heidecker so much

game assassin means virgin fyi.
Never laughed so hard, sheezus
"If you listen closely, you can hear giggling coming from the player." LMFAO

3:54 how black people cut their hair on purpose.
It's sooooooooooooo cringe worthy

The thumbnail keeps bringing me back
his name is michael tomasetti
how did this guy survive High school?
"Comic sans  warning.  We got a comic sans warning here guys..." ... I fuckin lost it.
Had his hair been longer "really??" He would have Sam peppers "REALLY!!!?" haircut
The broccoli cut makes him look like Stitches
"Thanks Mr. Onthespectrum!" Fucking gold!
navi, lol
I agree, but the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
well now we know why his hair was short for a while
REALLY!
I just noticed that I have the same keyboard as him.
I love how he says "my gaming gear has never been cleaner thnx to Dust Off" and you see the only "clean" keys are J and K
I tried those "gamer" glasses in an inflated (with a roof and pillars and everything like a fucking bounce house without a floor) booth at RTX and used them to look at their own screens to see the supposed difference it made. They said it was supposed to make screens clearer, more vibrant, and without any strain on your eyes. It was tinted orange-ish. That was it. $100-$200 for tinted glasses.
Because pfff who needs common Airspray?
He killed himself after
"Thanks Mr. On The Spectrum." 
I died omg ahahahhaa
that looked like a good keyboard
It doesn't matter what Hila does she makes me want to cum, pls how much will it cost for her to wear a strap on and peg me. Her mouth is amazing
I thought the giggling was coming from the kids in my basement.
"just fuck me up fam"
HE EMBRACED THE MEME.
This Gamer Gear guy reminds me of Mr. Caffeine...
is ethan a jew? He's got a jew-fro
i feel awkward...sitting in front of my keyboard....enjoying some humus while watching
The cringe
This is pretty much the only good reaction type channel
Your one of the few gaming that make me laugh so hard 😅 @h3h3productions
You need to remove your second chin
why did you mess up the nice keyboard at 4:50 :( i want a nice keyboard like that...
He will never gat laid.
This is my favorite video by H3. I laugh too hard every time I watch it
I bet you $1,000,000 he isn't a gamer. (not H3H3, the cringey guy)
Joel did it first
It fuckin kills me when he drinks the water lol
Ethan with his "broccoli" haircut looks like the Weeknd
REALLY
REALLY!!!
Why His Head Look Like First Slice Of Bread. ?
He says it's never been cleaner thanks to this product but he just put an entire jar of fucking cheese all over his keyboard and desk
8:16 i dont cringe very easily but i have never cringed so hard in my fucking life please euthanize me i dont want to live anymore
3:43 id actually rock that if i had curly hair
HE SAID REACT

Ugghhhhhh the cringe is too strong!!!!
Has anyone else completely fallen in love with the intro music?
The cringe gave me a heart attack. I'm very dead.
I dunno why but for some reason your whole delivery reminds me of Aziz Ansari..that or I'm loosing my mind :S anywho I'm a new subscriber loving the content you and Hila put out, perfect comedic timing and first class wit! Faith in YouTube comedy restored
The narrator of the dust spray video, sounds like Robby Motz.
meme
Damn, I need a can of that cleaner genger, too much dipping sauce on my keyboard.
"Just fuck me up, fam."
Love it how they show him wiping down the screen of an old iMac, like anyone is going to be gaming with one of those.

Your a bully wtf? On SoFlo you say he bully's smaller youtubers but your doing the same thing. Attention whore.
Is that the music from the world conqueror 2 app, just noticed that

"Thanks, Mr. 'On The Spectrum.'"
i died when he flipped the air duster
5:39 i"m fucking dead

"Thanks Mr On-The-Spectrum!"
Man, Aziz got fat.

So...why is Oprah in Ethan's intro?
Look out for the broccoli assassin guys

Ross O'donovan had a rough start
"Thanks, Mr. On-The-Spectrum"
My fucking sides
Idk what's worse the video your reacting to or the video of your reaction on this particular video...
Wtf is wrong with Youtubers these days
9:46 An autism joke, oh the irony...
You look like kenny from kenny vs spenny
That cut looks fresh though.
I get that this commercial is stupid. But so are you..... You actually bought
When he replayed the "f" part it reminded me of ass and titties song
4:52 lmao
This video is life
REALLY!
Wait, he said blu-ray player meaning this must have been made after the 80s? lmao whatttttt

What I can't understand is that you edit a vid when the cringe is real your intro is real I mean REALLY?!?!?
Anyone else remindid of this after the intro? http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/24800000/Judge-Jack-Sparrow-pirates-of-the-caribbean-24815869-608-258.png
fucking kys
what you did to that poor keyboard was pure heresy !!!! how did you sleep at night? are you having nightmares? did you even try to confess to a priest of what you ve done?
Does anyone else think they should stop people posting videos of people breaking their legs on yt?
Holy shit this has been bugging me for a while, I couldn't think of who this guy reminds me of, but he's totally Aziz Ansari's Jewish doppleganger
The intro gets me ever time
The white Aziz Ansari
THANKS MR. ONTHESPECTRUM
#broccoliassassin
This guy looks like Kootra and acts like him too
The was too funny when he got the broccoli cut.
Gotta love how he sits in a csdm server
am I the only one who laughed so hard it ducking hurt
I can't stop laughing at 4:50
i read it game gear and wondered how you're gonna rip humor out of it
I lost my shit at the broccoli cut
I swear ineed to stop watching these h3h3 videos thier making me laugh too hard one day I swear I'm gonna get a stroke
You actually made me notice how dirty my entire rig was. I literally just douched the whole thing in windex and scrubbed it with Walmart paper towels. Shit looks shiny as shit... mom would be so bproud! GAMER ASSASSIN!1111111!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
favorite H3h3 vid
Leafy is such a bully all he does is make fun of people I never do that
Bro this vid had me fucking dying!!!😂😂
Just flipped over my keyboard and found a quarter, H3H3 made me rich!
"Thanks Mr. On the spectrum" 😂😂😂
9:48 "Thanks Mr on the spectrum" Ironic considering what happened recently
RAPE
Laughed so hard that i had to sub, for this and VAPE vid :DD
hate your content please stop
wow smh
Eh, I mean it had it's moments but honestly dude isn't really that funny.
Kid & Play assassin.
He looks like Rain with that cut
Tbh his hair cut is like most hipsters nowadays.
Bigdaddywoowoo
7:34 - 7:53 Laughed so fecking hard into my coffee, gonna need some GamerAssassinAir to clean it all out of my keyboard. (Really, please help, it smells like Ethiopian Beans everywhere)
My chest hurts from laugh-cringing
I have surround sound in my headset so the giggling part was creepy as all hell. I thought there was a ghost behind me.
fun fact: the white stuff that comes out of those canned air cans is actually extremely toxic when burned. it produces a compound that is known as hydrogen fluorine. and, when it comes into contact with water in your lungs or the air, it produces hydrofluoric acid. hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid, but it binds to the calcium in the blood stream, causing insoluble salts to form, and thus causing fun shit such as hypocalcemia (low amounts of calcium), severe pain, and cardiac arrest.
THE CRINGE!!!
isnt this cleaning vid a joke? sarcastic? school project?
O F F F F F F FUCK OFF
This is the dumbest crap. Especially that stupid hat
How is this not worse than league shit?
Broccoli assassin
You got mad at leafy for making fun of an autistic guy but you said the guy promoting this product was "On the Spectrum". Sure, it wasn't as bad, but that's kinda hippocritical.
you're like a white aziz ansari lmfao
let's take a moment to appreciate how he probably ruined his CS:GO k.d. for this video
This was hardly funnyI don't understand the hype.
3:53 nordan shat's hair
"Help you see the game..."
13 secs later
"Fuck dude, I can't see. I can't fucking see through this"
"On the spectrum" OMGEEEEEEEE was that an autism joke? gaaaasssppp TRIGGERED
Talking crap about leafy when you're just as bad of a bully as him.
dude that's fucked up. this kid could have cancer or maybe even the people who wrote this script could have autism. fuk u bro. you're a fuking cyberbully, it's time to stop. where the fuk are your parents?? kys h3h3. I'm gonna go over to this video you're reacting to and fuking give that video hate because you told me to do so. lol jk you didn't tell me to do that but im using your logic so how about u fuk off m8?
10:45 is the best part of the vid.
wtf is this...
5:50 that giggle though
You can say crap about leafy but if you like to say crap about someone who didn't do anything aka pyrocinical that's just rude # nomorecancer
"think before you do"-Daniel tiger
To understand the depths of Satan press "4" repeatedly and wait for your lord and savior. Thank you
Fuck u faggot making fun of autistic people when u can't even afford a fucking tripod
Man, I thought Ethan was going to teach us how to clean a Game Gear.
this guy is Gareth Keenan with brown hair
I didnt know leafy uploaded on this channel
HEY! did you know that guy your making fun of is AUTISTIC? here, i'll just take away a quarter of your subs and gang up on you! :)
Bro, this channel is stupid as Fucck, yes with 2 C's. How about u get a life and stop stealing videos that aren't yours!!!Note: Get a better Camera./too much said.
Oh, forgot. I need to clap the shit out of my keyboard. Literally.
I wonder how this guy acts in real fucking life
Is hilla his wife or sister I can't tell
This video is ten minutes, forty-five seconds long.  At the 6:33 mark, I had to watch a fucking Nissan commercial.

Suck shit from my asshole, youtube.
6:08 Fuck that i get a baloon, fill it with air by the power of (MY  LOVE) then the blow
Or you know just blow
Calls himself a game assassin. Is using an iMac.
Your video on leafy... 😢
Lol, you're such a fucking try hard. Lmfao
Please make fun of me, i need same views
4:00 Athene and Furious said brocolli is fucking good.
Dudette, did you really buy their products or did you just create your own? For this video.
Laugh real quietly at night
So gamer girls are ladies but gamer boys are terminators I thought that was only in the movies now we're is John Connor
Ok. 



YOURE LITERALLY MAKING FUN OF A YOUTUBE CHANNEL THAT IS SMALLER THAN YOURS. CHECK YOUR LAST VIDEO.
Dude in the video is what Filthy Frank's and Rubberninja's love child would look like
REALLY
IMETHANBROCOLLIBERRY
Ethan you totally 80s furfag.
What's the keyboard model that he used to trash?
why are you making fun of a weird kid he could be autistic?!
Wen u see a Tia Lopez snapchat add before this video
Reallyyyy

This guy is a huge tim and eric fan.  Love it
That's an Azza Gaming Mouse and keyboard I USE TO USED THAT LOL
You remind me of Jon
REALLY
2:18 OMFG XD
The dude in this infomercial has lizard Illuminati eyes. It kind of creepy me out, I'm not going to lie.
Did chadtronic give you the idea of coming up with this video
Easily one of the top then videos in the world, gotta be...!
the broccoli cut lol
I like how he mentions the bowl cut, but not the gigantic neck. Like, jesus, it's a giraffe.
"like-- ya do."
the keyboard scene legitimately triggered me. time to go to local news
IM ETHAN REALBERRY
I usually never laugh out loud at youtube videos.  But I fuckin' LOST it at 4:55
Fresh cut bro!
You are hilarious. Dry reaching over the stupidity that is the internet.
He should keep his hair like that
8:16 cringe cringe,  i almost died
LMAO @2:20
So Mr. Safety instructs you to turn your PC completely off, before putting in the CD.
So what is the point of putting in a CD in a turned off PC?
Talks about gaming gear. Starts cleaning a mac
Stfu for 5 seconds atleast holy fuck
My keyboard has it's own ecosystem :(
it legit hurt me looking at that keyboard
im cringing soo hard at all the crap you just put on that mouse and keyboard! yuuuuuuck
Joel
>when you notice you have the same exact keyboard (K120 logitech)

kek
h3h3 = If Chadtronic and Jontron did a FUUUSSIIOOOOONNN-HAAAAAAA!!!!!
SHAMWOWOWOWOWWOWOWOWOWOWOW
REAAAAALY!?
@9:46 this killed me
1 like = 1 gamer gear
that hair could catch on
Really?
尺巨人𠃊𠃊丫
What's with the Natus Vincere
who the fuck is this like american ross
This video makes me so giddy. I watch it like every fucking day
never knew ethan played counter stroke
I swear to god I've seen this guy somewhere before...
RIP that keyboard and mouse i would so have taken it and gave it a good home.
I have wonderful straight hair, perfect for the gamerssassin cut.
THIS IS THE BEST CHANNEL HOLY FUCK, THEY'RE SO FUNNY WHAT IS THIS
I have the same keyboard as Ethan
"Thanks Mr. On the Spectrum" oh my god lost it
Whoa Ross, you turned into a giraffe man, and are now autistic, well fuck.
"thanks Mr on the spectrum" I died
10:03 that freaking scared me and i had to remove my headphones to check where sound is coming from :D
REALLY!!!
This is definitely me when I clear my gamer gear
This is my 3rd time watching this video
4:51 I have that same keyboard
BigDaddyWooWoo!
"Splooge" gets me everytime somehow
3:47 sam pepper
Dust on dust off.
but what the add forgot to tell you it gets you twice as high when you huff it. well worth the price increase.
Kill me!
The cringe is real
REALLY
CAN YOU FUCKIN STOP with the alarms in videos guys pls I live in Israel
 




pls
thanks Mister TF2 Engineer
Ethan is so funny
I had an epiphany about the meaning REALLY?!? behind the REALLY?!? that was so awkwardly placed. He was scoffing at the various games people play to keep their gaming gear in top performance, instead of buying overpriced re-branded products like a true Game Assassin. REALLY?!? You buy regular air in a can instead of our special air in a can that's been exhaled by the greatest comedic genius of the century- Jeff Dunham? REALLY?!?
I died when he said "Thanks mr. on the spectrum"
Is that Ross' twin from Steam Train?
the jk keys were clean haha
3:50 - <3 Ethan's hair
This is the best video I have seen in years
"If that increases my chance of getting laid by 1%"😂😂😂😂
You are f***cking 100000x better than Jinx in reaction videos
nuclear energy water!
I came here because of papa Franku.
Didn't Chadtronic do this a while ago...
Rain Florence needs to give that keyboard an enema.
rip me, cringed to death
I cringed so hard that I...I think I got an hernia now. sh*t.
why is sid from ice age trying to sell me a can of air
holy shit my pc is in the same case and i bought it from cyberpower (but the logo is in a different place)
This is my favorite fucking youtube channel ever lmao
This is my favorite fucking youtube channel ever lmao
I'm more of a game pacifist rather than a game assassin.
Really
oh this is priceless :D
that cut was actually not bad on you.
funny af m8
FUCKING NAVI STICKER ON GLASSES
Christ that poor keyboard
AH EW CRAZY, AH EW OUTTA YAH MIND!!!!!!!
I'm sure it's been said before but I fucking love how he calls his wife 'dude'. Why is that so amusing?
3:08 just fuck me up fam

HISS..
Why is really not a meme since this video?
Did you get this video from a 90s vault? His character is sooooo cartoonish.

I fucking lost it at 'thanks Mr on the spectrum'
I would spray a few cans of that air into that weird pleb's eyes
This guy reminds me so much of Tim Heidecker, and that's a good thing.
Oh god, not this video! I had to put up with Joel watching it an now it's here to xD
Really!
"Thank you Mr. On-The-Spectrum"
Is it just me or does that hair cut look pretty good on him
THE CRINGE LEVEL OF THIS VIDEO IS OVER 9000!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:45 the sam pepper
probably my favorite h3h3 to date.
This guys should do a stand up comedy
th th ... this is so FUCKING CRINGE! OML! thx gamer gear guy cause now I have fucking autism!
Actually its not a can of air, it is fluoroethane compounds 5:23 ... But I agree that he should stop taking the can for an inhaler
You REALLY should've colored the broccoli cut green.
Nova using faggot
Hila :  OKay, so how do i do it?
Ethan: Just fuck me up, fam
Really.
This was hilarious
I didn't realize the horrific animal noises at 10:10 were from the video at first.

I jumped up thinking an orangutan broke into my house, and nearly punted my cat.
F F F really really really Dj dust off
my god...

I have the same keyboard as hanbEW

ethan*

damnit keyboard, work..
Dust-Off? Fuck off.
0:14 out of all the teams, why navi XD
That hair cut look surprisingly not bad.
His hair looks grey! Is he really that old? 😂
wtf
i've watched this to many times.
This mainly seems like a bad skit from the first days of youtube.
this video REALLY made me laugh
Knees weak, arms are heavy, he's internet famous already.

Michael Tomasetti.
Unkie Jorgel did it furst, huehuehue
just grab your accordion
broccoli assassin LMAO I'm dying
"REALLY" LMAO
Wanna know how you can tell that the guy in the video isn't a gamer? He has only one console in front of him...and it's a fucking Wii. We need more H3H3!!! I shoot 7 gram rocks of H3H3 every 4 hour bitch!
You can not find this air any-air pun intended
You can not find this air any-air pun intended
The computer he was cleaning with that wipe was a Mac....... And he calls himself a gamer.....







REALLY??
i know that this video is kinda fucked and this guy only did this add cause he got payed... but this guy in person is RRRRRR REALY  cool in person
This guy crushes pussy.
"Thanks Mr. On The Spectrum" XDDDDD IM DEAD
It might be a tumor
08:18 Lord spare me the cringe
REALLY!
8:53 
ooooooooh so thats where STAR_ got that intro from his sterferge video
paid actor
10,000th comment. :D :/
6:22
Rias Gremory. Eh, decent enough taste in girls.
Those aren't real gamer glasses,it has Dota 2 logo.
PC gamers beware this is not for the faint of heart. You have been warned.
"Thanks Mr. On -The-Spectrum" oh fuck I died
the haircut actually worked...
I'VE FALLEN AND I CAN'T GET UP
Watching him do that to his keyboard and mouse made me have a panic attack :(
I need to chill the fuck out.
"Just fuck me up, just fuck me up fam"
4:51
thanks Mr. OnTheSpectrum
Does anyone know the background song that's playing before the intro?
And that's how you use dust off cleaner geenger
really
Why does that guy sound like Grant Gustin in the Flash?
I would just like to be that guy and say what everybody knows:

If your computer is hibernating, that means it's 100% off.
i hate that fucking intro
I remember years ago when Chip and Ironicus riffed this, the cringe memories flood back.
I honestly don't think that guy has ever touched a video game
make sure your computer's O.F.F. ...now open the disk tray and run this program.
That poor keyboard 6:02 and really!?!
let's face it there's a hipster out there that probably has that hair cut
Literally just came back from that same haircut
He's using an auto in CSGO in one of the scenes......
BRO.
It hurt when you ruined your keyboard and mouse...and when that guy talked.
am i the only one who thinks that ethan looked better in the bowl cut?
Is it bad that I've gone through a few keyboards that ended up looking like that?
Congratulations, Ethan. You now look like Sam Pepper.
This guy looks like he'd be a good fit for Hank's brother from Corner Gas :P
+2:39 your gonna get sued by the finebros
brocclassin
guy looks way more comfortable in his own skin when he's dressed as a woman. that look on his face is the look of somebody who's finally found his true self.
@0:26 sound MOTORBOATING TITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I saw a dude while i was coming home from college who had the broccoli cut, and he looked content. I feel sorry for him
that's why he was playing de_dust 2
lol he says it dumb but they fooled him they made him buy it so huh he got fucked
5:48 I love how you guys cracked up, I was laughing too!
haha "ladies and terminators" wtf
REALLY
3:50 LOL he actually looks better like that :D
Really
That Robby Motz
When Ethan is in double chin/receding neck mode looks like he needs to shit....
the fucked up thing is that cut doesn't look bad on Ethan
this was so good I had to watch the full clip myself. I thougt you may have edited it heavily but I was pleasatly surprised that you just played his clip from the start and he edited it like that himself lol.
Fuck.  This one is worthy of an emmy.
what a freak
Just fuck me up, fam.
please tell me you weren't actually using that keyboard
3:08 just fuck me up fam
1:38 pretty sure saying dudette increases my chances of getting laid by 420% m9
does it include my fleshlight, im not just a gamer. im a pro
I cried from too much laughter.
im dying
10:00 gave me an LSD flashback
5:37 dust_2
note 2 self: clearly that High Score is cleaner than this
👌
Michael was such a good sport the way he embraced this video, lots of respect for the guy
I can't be the only one who heard the giggling coming from around me?
4:55 made me choke on my drink. Thanks H3H3
For some reason Ethan reminded me of Robert Downey Jr with the long hair and glasses and shit lmao
I didn't think I could cringe more after watching One Fricked Up Dentist...I was wrong!!  But this cringe was more enjoyable XD. I think...?
Hello Mr. On the Spectrum lmao
Are... Are they related orrrr married?
Rape.
What is his neck?
5:40 actually works, if you use it right! rekt
This is fucking incredible
6:30 look how the letters J and K are clean in the midst of the dirty keys. Nice subliminal messaging Ethan , keep it up.
Kids REACT To fine bro's getting banned from youtube.. Controversy ensues.
It's so shit that it's funny... wait no, it really isn't. It's is seriously just fucking stupid with nothing else good.

HAVE FUN KIDS! :D
'Gaming Ger (intentionally spelled wrong) wipe' = baby wipe
'Germing Ga sprai'= Dust Off
'Gamoon geur swav' = one of those things you clean ur ears wit.
 
Get all of this sexy gear now and be a fucking amazing guy that pays fucking 175% extra for his basic cleaning equipment.
WHAT KINDA GAMER USES A MAC?? THE FUCK??
I'm sad because Joel found this first, and he's not as popular, but the video spread.
So that's why people in DeathMatch are AFK, their just cleaning their keyboards with the cleaner ginger
When he got to the "footage of actual gamer"...
Let's just say I started rolling in the floor...
Lolz
reminds me of Ted Mosby
the cringe
2:37 finebros looking from the distance
wtf, that guy is absolutely unbelievable!
i always clean my mouse, my headest, my computer, my screen AND my keybord like this!
this fresh air! i´ve never had anything better!
so why is he trying to make him look bad???
i really cannot understnad that ...
"Thanks mr. Safety!"

H3h3: "thanks mr. On the spectrum"

Goddamn
That giggling made me pause this video to actually see if some is giggling behind me or behind my door lol
how does your wife not die laughing filming you
fuck me up fam
But Mr. Safety, when the computer is in hibernation it is off.
this ad hurts to watch
Ethan's gaming keyboard is giving away the joke. As he reaffirms how clean and immaculate his gamer gear is thanks to Dust-off, the only keys that are visible in the middle amidst the gunk are "j" and "k".
Anyone else reminded by Ross from game grumps from his face?
Sidecut really fits Ethan, dude!
I swear I just caught cringetietous from this advertisement.
that made you .... "react ????? "    fine bros are gunna rape your ass
saya dari amanah
.uoy fo duorp m"I , pu ti peek , sevom taerg , nahtE , woW
an African child could have eaten that keyboard
Ethan become The Weeknd with the broccoli assassin hair cut

GENUALLY laughed at haircut scene. SUBSCRIBE EARNED.
3:50 u look like the weeknd
"just fuck my shit up"
5:05 LMAOO
''Im gonna get fucking owned by noobs with a cut like this'' lmfao can't stop laughing.
Editing and Sassy-ness on point Ethan.
omg when he gagged at "game assassin's" i died
rip keyboard
That guy in the video tries to come across as alive and excited, but his eyes are fucking dead.
HQHAHAHAGAHA 4:45 "SPLOOGE"
#howtobasic
good fucking god this is cringy
"Make sure it's completely O.F.F.F.F.F offfff."
All of the cringe
that guy made a video about this
This video has more views than the original video.
Shame on you.
dont you hate it when you burp after you cringe!
That part at the end with all the weird sounds freaked me the fuck out at first I thought the sound was coming from my house and not my headphones, creepy shit.
considering what seems to be considered the standard for a 'reaction video'' (sitting with the video being reacted to in a corner and just nodding and smiling like a slow kid at a museum), calling these reaction videos doesn't do them justice, and i absolutely love this shit xx
i cant cope with the cheesey covered Ethan and his entrancing eyebrows xD
BigDaddyWooWoo
Dont you dare make fun of game assassins , you are so gonna get rekt... but first let me grab my accordion and baby wipes
L
Cringe is killing me.

this is my first h3h3 video I've seen. I like.
I get a really creepy vibe from these people...This scruffy dirty man has this young hot, foreign wife. I think the wedding wasn't the only thing that was expensive here
Damn hila sure knows how to do a fresh cut
Poor keyboard. He covered that so hard, I don't even think it would be usable after that.
8:48 Gamer Gear for your Gamer Mac
That guy's editing is so creepy... it's like the awkward jump-cuts and close-ups that Filthy Frank and h3h3 use for comedy, except you can tell he's being serious.
https://www.reddit.com/r/MusicProducers
How can a DVD clean a disc drive? I don't get it?
I heard there would be beanies, I was wrong.
0:27 oh my god! I laughed like for 2 minutes straight XD

Kids in Africa could've eaten that keyboard

h3h3 took so much of his humor and style from Tim and Eric, but it is so fucking hilarious, so who really cares.
I don't really understand why a thousand people disliked this video
Im sick, and that 4:00 part I nearly died from cough/laughing...

Health risk bro...
That whole bit with the keyboard made me click the subscribe-button.
I'm glad that he bought the real gamer doritos with double XP. Otherwise it would be just a regular residue, not a game residue.
legend
That guy looks like a fucking alien
The guy recently embraced the meme!
And he embraced it incredibly well.
His channel is Michael Tomasetti
Really?
Jesus fucking christ I'm watching this with headphones on and that giggling nearly gave me a stroke
If you react to this comment, The FineBros will find you and they will sue you.
I can't quite put my finger on it, but there's something about that guy's face that just looks... off. I suspect that it's something with his eyes, but I don't know.
999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999% chance this kid is a virgin (not h3h3)
rip keyboard
I like how Michael Tomasetti responded to this video. ( The dude in the ad', by the way XD ! ))
It's like idubbztv hit 40 years old
Truthfully, who else now coughs violently and pretends to be sick like Ethan when they see something the don't like? I do, it's like a new tick Iv developed...
I looked at your keyboard and thought I saw something familiar.
I have the same type of keyboard.
REALLY!
03:44 you kinda look like the weeknd
h3h3 more like r1l1
Really?
This nerd in the ad has hammered the final nail in the coffin regarding his chances of ever losing his virginity
Who else just can't stop watching this video?
I have legitimately paused the video multiple times because I was laughing so hard.
you (of) proud, up (it) keep, moves great, Ethan wow
I fucking love h3h3
00:29 that PP Bizon tho
his voice changed so much when he leaned back and said wow

"grab your accordion what the fuck kind of analogy is that???" my favorite quote out of all of his videos
"That's it ladies and terminators" 

I'm fucking done.

Pleb.
This shit was hilarious.

I didn't cringe this badly since a while
Wait, are Hila and Ethan siblings, or are they married?
#besthaircutever
Dont forget to watch his (the guy in the commercial) response to this video too, just search michael tomasetti (his channel) and watch his latest video
Why is that Obama lady in your intro?
5:38 ARe you playing CS GO with a nova shotgun???
lost it at 3:44
REALLY!!!
We shouldn't blame the guy whos in that ad. We should be feeling bad for him and hate the writer. The guy is just trying to get by. His eyes scream help.
Pause at 3:59 

That haircut makes the nigga look like The Weeknd
Oh man, that haircut. xDDDDDDDDDDD
Pew, chop, bang! FINISH HIM!
Anyone else wants to low key smash Hila
I'm ashamed of myself that I haven't discovered this channel sooner. Oh my fuck, this is funny...

LMAO Claims to be a gamer but uses a Mac.
The thumbnail gives me life

Wow so funny):
my pc glitched when he made puking sounds so I thought my PC climaxed
Better than Chadtronic's reaction 😂😂😂😂😂
Ethan actually looks better with that haiircut
2:16 Thank me later

You should sell gamer water and glasses for $100,000,000,000,000,000.
I'd rather buy gamer water than diamond water.
ROFLMAO
@2:39 see you in court
man youve provided me with so much laughter good work keep it up
WTF INTRO IS RETARTED
Your videos are so painful to watch. Not from the cringe... but because my abdomen hurts from laughing
This is a reaction video done right. Actual comedic value and integrity, not monetizing a video in the bottom right hand corner while you stare at it and cough every know and again. Good on ye, h3h3
Fucking love this dude!
REAALLLLY???????????????
O...F...F...F...F...F

Omfg I was crying after the hair cut lol broccoli assassin! Lmfao
no matter how old this guy is, his video's are genius as fuck.
HE PLAYS CSGO OMG  DYING
Now it's time to "Clean the optics on your CD, DVD, and Blu-Ray player"

I mean this is great advice for a computer that doesn't actually do any computing. 

Not like you need SSDs, Hard Drives, GPUs, CPUs, heatsinks, fans, SATA cables, X-pin connectors, reservoir pumps, tubing, motherboards, or a power supply.

I feel really bad for anyone that actually listened to this advice lol. It's basically like all the "Gamer" branded computer hardware. It's pretty much all overpriced [2-3x] shit and used to bait in customers that have no idea what they're doing.
Please, someone, the dust off guy looks just like a llama doesn't he???
This guy is straight MLG. Sempai must surely favor him.
6:22 Bigdaddywoowoo  WTF 😂
lol, never heard of you before untill Boogie2988. Im now subscribed.
This is my favorite video on YouTube, I've watched it so many times
lol when he said this is the good stuff
God this was cringeworthy.
I laugh so hard everytime he replays the, "Really!" part. 😂😂😂
First make sure your PC is OFF! Now insert this disk and follow the audio instructions. 

what.
REALLY?
8:16 R.I.P Columbine Highschool.
That giggling sound is legitimately trippy as fuck.
Damn Ross from game grumps has not aged well
6:31.   It can't be a coincidence that the only two clean keys spell JK
Gamer Gunk.
why the fuck do you guys put the source video all the way at the bottom?
nice song in the beginning. European War 4: Napoleon
Wow my keyboard doesn't get incredibly stupid like that
Wow, reaction to a 5yr old fake advert [I always thought it was a troll at least]?? Stuck for ideas?
In case you haven't seen it the dust off guy made a response video to this.
Well I should just kill myself as I actually related to the accordion analogy.
You know, the script is pretty bad, but I'll say, Michael's acting was pretty freakin' good!
@4:00 he looks like he's about to get the Club Going Up on a Tuesday
I wonder where is this guy now, because that video is made in 2010.
3:45

The giggling scared the shit out of me.
This is gold
He has actually embraced becoming a meme. Kudos.
8:47 - How to alienate gamers: Show a mac.
i felt really uncomfortable at 4:55. when he put his hand on the mouse oh god

Your channel is pure AIDs
"Thanks "Mr. On the spectrum"
10/10
"Just fuck me up fam"
DOES HE BANG THAT CHICK
What is this intro
The actor took it like a champ. He seems pretty friendly too, and it seems he's going to be in a video with Ethan and Hila later. Good on him.
Wait....I think he's joking about being a virgin
5:50 WTF
When you dumped the dip on your keyboard, I cringed. xD
How many times did he say game?
ethan you didnt use the product as he said gosh
HELL YEAH NATUS VINCERE
Dat broccoli cut
I actually got terrified from the giggling.. I thought somebody is behind me.
Why does his computer lack a disc drive? How do you get anything done on that computer?
holy fuck broccoli assassin. I can't stop laughing fuck😩😩😂😂😂😂💯💯💯💯
Gamer gunk comes from playing too much DOA
Leafy, Pyro, and H3H3 VS MrBlackDarkness666, Glitche Gaming, and the REALLY guy. That needs to happen.
And thats how you use gamer gunk cleaner gingr to clean your gamer gunk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -Ethan 2015 RIP in Pepperoni
dude, you are honestly brilliant.
10:03 Gotta be honest, that freaked me out a bit. Earphones made it sound like it came from around the room i was in
Did that guy just dress up like the Engineer from Tf2? I hope that's what he was going for anyway
That giggling is real creepy with a headset om.
That haircut is the haircut of douches, or at least every douche I see has a haircut like that.
Well technically the advertisement succeeded since it made Ethan buy gamer gear dust off for the video.
Really?
Really ?? - check mate!!
i just found H3, where has this been my whole life
you actually went through with the bowl cut LMAO XD
Watching h3h3 videos till the very end is like getting dementia
who els is watching while taking q shit
THE BROCCOLI ASSASSIN 
MY FUCKING SIDES
you make me laugh till my stomach hurts!
Lol does gamer gear guy know what hibernation is? Also, 8 bucks for normal air? it's like 5 bucks at Walmart
I'm afraid to watch the actual video, after watching this. I might go dumber or insane
6:30 the moment when the only clear part is the "JK"
"Thanks mister 'on the spectrum'"

ROFL
cyberpower PCs suck
Mike Tomatelli represent!
Hila: okayy so how do I do it? Ethan: just, just fuck me up, just fuck me up fam
PLANET RANGERS!
When he ruined the keyboard i felt physical pain. Because i own the same keyboard, i suffered.
You soulless bastard! Starving children in Africa could have eaten that keyboard.
Broccoli assassin
REALLY
"Really!"
Please make this into a Exe Ethan
Am I the only person who finds Hila really attractive?
Hey...I say dudette:(
This video had so much cringeworthy content I had to pause it to be able to survive.
(The ad, that is)
REALLY
That haircut was true dedidation
10:03 scared the heck out of me!  I legit thought there was a ghost or demon in my house
Ethan went out, bought the products from the video, fucked up his hair and trashed his keyboard just to prove a point.
That's true dedication.
>tfw you're legitimately on the spectrum but these autistic jokes are tight
6:22 heh heh heh 

Anyone ? 
just me ? 
ok...
2:41 and we arent even 5 seconds into the video lol
Help i think i got terminal cringe after "That" in 8:16
Kids in Africa could have eaten that keyboard!
broccoli? Where's dan bull?
Massive shoutout to the guy for being such a good sport about it, really. :)

Oh, no...Don't cut the jew fro :(
The giggling sounds like it's outside of me earbuds....
Everyone's playing checkers, but I've been playing chess for years. :D
"Game assassins" made you react eh? have fun with your lawsuit! - fine bros

And so the legend begins
I feel like this guy would be a perfect fit for Adult Swim. He's fucking hilarious.
INTROUCING THE BROCCOLI ASSASSIN
ya know it's weird, I usually can't sit through like 10 seconds of cringe shit but I somehow made it through this entire video
REALLY!!!
R.i.p keyboard
Grab your accordion, like you do 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I made a commercial a long time ago called Atomic Water, ethan stole my idea with gamer water im gonna SUE

I had to fucking pause the video at the giggling because the audio is panned so well, that I thought one of the giggling was actually happening behind me 

god these ear buds are great 
fucking almost died lol
Dont throw food at the computer :: michael rosen"
1:99 put sublities on it says:

I used to think Hila was ugly, but she is kinda cute in her own way
you look like 90s the rock
holy shit i just cleaned by dvd drive and got gladiator rank in wow! This stuff really works!
5:40 actually working quite well there for a while
Remember kids, can't do it dirty, gotta do it clean.
God that kids cunt face..
i think you're actually reacting to a parody video
Wow, Ethan, great moves. Keep it up. Proud of you.
the comic sans warning bahaha
what's funny is he actually doesn't look all that bad with the broccoli cut
Guys, the REALLY guy has released a video in response to this one. And it's great. Look up Michael Tomasetti, or watch Ethan and Hila's newest video.
Broccoli  hair was almost cool
Honestly one of the fucking funniest videos and youtubers I've ever seen. R-R-R-Reeeaallly!!!
Ethan! I love your vids mang but I have to ask. Is that an AZZA keyboard you poured cheese whiz on? Damn dude, you should have used the dell one and kept the fancy red buttons! Just kidding. I have one of those red button keyboards, and it has these side buttons that screw me every time I get serious in an online pvp match. I end up muting it or some crazy thing, so Im screaming at everyone but I don't hear them. Then I realize it was my keyboard, but its too late because my team was like 'screw this asshole' and left me to die. So my question is..what flavor cheese whiz WAS that? :)
The flash
dude tht broccoli cyt is like sam peppers hair
We know his channel xD
this is so funny im crying
The preschool that my mum works at only uses comic sans for their stuff. THEY USE IT ON EVERYTHING THEY MAKE!
If you touched up the hair it wouldve really looked sick
Why does Ethan resemble Chris Kirkpatrick and the Gamer Gear dude resemble JC Chasez of *NSYNC?
this man has dedication to his jokes
Really?
I wanna be that Gamer Gear guy's friend.
The Dust-Off guy looks kind of like Jodie Foster.
Gamer dudes, dudettes...
Omg broccoli cut I'm dead
When he said broccoli assassin I immediately thought Brock Lee from Filthy Frank.
ayy lmao
Ethan has mad hair growing skilp. Holy fuck dude. Really
Im tripping hard on gorrila glue #4 and watching this video. stay high everyone! :)
LMFAOOO! ginger
"Hila, What the fuck is this? I'm not a game assassin, i'm a broccoli assassin." Earned my sub. xD
"You wanna know a dirty little secret?" Gamer's hate it!
LOL
If my computer giggled, I would break the shit out of it and run away from home.
He's cleaning a Mac. I mean, as I understand not so many gamers use it for gaming.
I wish I was as funny-looking as you Ethan. I would get so many chicks dude.
"Thank you, Mr. On-the-spectrum."
XD
Now I know what video my gay curly haired female housemate watched before she cut her own hair that one time.
2:41 wow he has the same brand on his monitor as i do lol
i cringed so hard when it cut to him spilling cheese and doritos all over his keyboard and mouse
hahaha hahaha that
Oh my fucking god I was watching this alone late at night wearing some headphones, and when that giggling came  at 10:03 I was really confused because it was just like someone was in the room with me. I actually had to stop the video just to make sure. Like WOW that was creepy as hell.
mr on the spectrum
thx Mr on the spectrum
really
gamer water 98% better than gamma
this video is cancer
8:02 So You KILL all those nasty germans
@6:30 JK bro
2:39, what was that? Some made you REACT. RIP h3h3, getting sued by FineBros soon, REALLY
My grandpa calls my sister dudette it reminds me this every time he says it.
The guys reaction video to this video is priceless
1:45 no I wasnt
I cant help but to admire how pacient Hila is...
pretty much league of legends players at the start
I R-R-R-R-R-R-RRREALY like this R-R-R-R-R-RRREALYYY funny reaction video
2:35 see you in court ethan
6:27 it literally says jk on the keyboard xD so perfect
do.. do you l-like n-na'vi? oh n-no
The original video is just obliterated with dislikes. I say that they think us gamers are idiots that would buy anything with "Gaming" in the title, amirite?
I lost my shit at broccoli assassin
Proffessionals, like me! god dammit do you look like Einstein to the world?
That cunt does not know how to clean a keyboard.
You take off the keys. You clean them like you clean the dishes. You put them in warm water and dish soap and then you scrub them.
The keyboard you wipe with soap and water etc.
Then let it dry for 1 week so you are sure there is no more water left in the keys. (Or you use a hair dryer and try that shit up faster.)
That Stupid cunt can't clean keyboards, trying to sell a product and telling people how NOT to clean a keyboard. God damn.
When you reviewed water and glasses your voice became like Snake's from Metal Gear.
"Thanks, Mr. "on the spectrum""

Holy shit Ethan you are a living legend LMFAO
2:32 uggh xD
"Just fuck me up fam"
I was stoned asf when i watched this, and that laughing shit tripped me the fuck out !! hahah
i just had a seizure. "kill them all"
i was about to go to sleep on this but then he cloned himself.
God the giggling part scared the shit out of me. That surround sound got me fucked up xD
Putting that shit on his keyboard should be part of a cringe compilation.
I know it was for the video, but cleaning your cheese covered keyboard... Was it worth it? XD
Idk whether to be hungry or grossed out at that keyboard thing
That guy reminds me of Artosis
every time he drinks the water at 0:25 i lose it
Thanks Mr. Onthespectrum!
Hahahahahahahaha
Ethan is mutha fuckin meme machine
Are you trying to say that these "Super Sniper 1337 MLG Boom Headshot: Mountain Dewrito Edition" branded waters are just the same as every other brand of water?

I have a feeling this incredible halfwit isn't human, but actually a cartoon alien version of a human ripped out of a flash cartoon from Canada locked deep in the cesspit of really bad cancelled Canadian cartoons from like, 1998 or so, still thinks saying "cowinky-dink" is still funny, and was about to terrorize the entire planet when he discovered video games.  Then he made a commercial about his misguided findings about computer care using his nightmarish powers.
Gamer Gear Guy is a fucking champion. First person to embrace their meme-hood. Hats of to you sir, REALLY!!

It's awesome how the guy (Michael Tomasetti) realizes that he's a meme and goes along with it. Props to you, man!
Gamer gear guy is taking this like a total bro.  Very unsoflo of him.
Wait, if you turn off your computer (O.F.F. Off) how are you supposed to put in the disc they give you?

The gamer gear actually wrote a post on h3h3 subreddit and made a video check it out

https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/45440j/i_am_michael_tomasetti_aka_the_gamer_gear_guy_ama/
Been having a bad week, non stop rainy weather, my grandma is dying. And on top of all that I was diagnosed with depression, however despite all of this h3h3's videos have helped make this week a little bit brighter for me. Thanks :)
The guy responded on the H3H3 subreddit

https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/45440j/i_am_michael_tomasetti_aka_the_gamer_gear_guy_ama/
Since there's an AD, I just wanted to say that h3h3productions is the only channel where I intentionally do not skip ads.
thanks do dust off gets an actual dust-off ad right after
I saw a real life broccoli assassin at school today.
1$ of compressed  air at best buy...

It's so weird, I know a kid with the name Ethan Klein no joke
i spit my water all over myself and started choking in laughter xd
Dude, you're gonna get sued by The Fine Brothers for using the word React™ion.  You might want to take down this video before they get butthurt.
Fun fact: YouTube now automatically puts a trademark symbol next to every instance of the word REACT™, but only in comments
React™ react™ rEaCt™ react™ing





Lol jk, keep up the good work.
did you just say "that made me react"? Chill out man, the fine bros are about to sue your ass.
"just fuck me up"
are you a game assassin dewwd? I love these two.
You're on point today! Hilarious even!
Jj
That giggling scared the crap outta me!

5:45 im not the only one who has done that
and wtf man. I thought Hila was ur wife? Do u jews not have sex or something?
game assassin made you REACT?? no u cant react. humans cant react. You have to pay to react. THEfIneCunts invented reaction. Only they get to react.
Game assassin made you react? It shouldn't, only the Fine Bros can
This guy looks like Marie from Breaking Bad
I died.
you should make more exe-s
Wow Ethan! Your wife Hila is so beautiful!
hila looks like a younger Kristen wiig.
keep tha hair ROFLMAO
Holy fuck that giggling sounds creepy when wearing headphones... sounds like it's coming from outside...
Please do a review of JoeysWorldTour!! His Nutella challenge or any of the fast food reviews he does. They are so cringy.
Anyone else think this guy looks like Hawkeye from MASH?
Damn.....Thats why I was bronze V all that time...
"Thanks Mr. On The Spectrum."

I'm autistic, and I found that joke hilarious, keep it up man!
Took me a moment to realise the Mum was actually the kid in drag.
damn, he looks good in drag.
ETHAN REACT TO DEAR FAT PEOPLE
This intro is so cringeworthy
guys the meme is self aware
Comic sans warning reminded me of gaza
edups vs f3gf3gittscuntructions
2:38 Careful, Fine Bros might get on your ass for that one.
when the guy says doodad he seems like m3rk's bro
This insectoid sends chills creeping up my spine. The "mum would be so proud" scene made me want to curl into a ball and weep. Fuck
Dude is funny as fuck, spills cheese on keyboard "I'm a real gamer" hahaha
2:38 ... you can't react without paying millions to TheFineBros and you know that....
a fkn acordeon
Guys, everyone know that all gamers wear shitty hoodies, shirts, pants, and shoes. So when companies portray gamers like that, their obviously right.

Nah but for real though, that's bullshit and not all gamers get dressed in the dark. That stereotype annoys the fuck out of me.
Very few people can bring me to tears from laughing so hard... Ethan is most definitely one of them. fucking brocoli cut
THE BROCCOLI HAD ME DYING
The theme song is stuck in the 90's
3:41

Actually looks pretty good.
That horrible background giggling sound at the end! Watched this at 1AM with headphones on, and I literally thought some fucking demon baby was laughing behind me! 
"10/10, liked, subscribed, won't sleep ever again" - IGN
i wonder which is better gamer water or diamond water... hmm
just wait for the fine brothers
8:18 - 8:21 most cringe thing i have ever seen in my life.
I have the keyboard he demolishes XD
i have the same pc
That video is comedy genius!
Wait a minute... Was Hila pulling a chub and tuck? Bro, you two have got the moves; good stuff fam.
What is that chassis called
I've come to regard this video as somewhat of a masterpiece. One of the best pieces of satire I've ever seen.
That haircut looks like Laowhy86.
2:38 reported for copyright
that thumbnail you chose. ahahahah
Whats the song name at 0:01
2:43 does he say "you probably fucking suck" or does he say "you're probably fucking sick"
this video made me a virgin again
Amazing
You are one of the closest things out there to Tim and Eric, and I mean that in the best way possible. Hilarious stuff
And our trademark item, Gamer Water™. This water is PULSING with energy! ARGAHARGHATYAGJRGAHRJAGRHHH

I almost died of suffocation.
Might want to censor 2:38 Thefinebros might take this down.
the haircut probably would have worked if he just cut the sides of his head without the bowl
React? youre going to be s-s-s-sued!
My gaming gear has never been cleaner thanks to dust off "J K"
0:24 my new wallpaper
So this guy, the REALLY guy, made a video about this, he is INTERNET FAMOUS (check the h3h3 reddit)
See you laterz ladies and terminatorz
If you go to his YouTube channel he made a video about this becoming a meme!
I think we all know this gamer gear guy is a virgin and has no friends.
Hold the phone here, is this actor Tommy from Arrow?!
What the hell was that fire hydrant stuff coming out of the compressed air can??
Did he just REACT at 2:40? He's gonna be sued...
2:37 Copyright. Get ready.
"thanks Mr. On the spectrum" IM EWEWARGEJIHTW HAHAHAHAHA
He literally looks like a white The Weeknd
That poor keyboard ;_;
Now I can't see a stream play a non mainstream game without saying "Oooh the games people play" :p
Pause at 9:28. Disturbing :P
This dudes face is punchable as fuck
I wanna be a game assasin
why does there have to be ads on YouTube videos
this video was very good I appreciate it, thank you ethan for the good quality video 

hghf
That shite is so cringy that must be a joke. It ia a joke, but a serious one.
Calling females dudettes is the same as 'matettes'. Rly, just call them dude or mate anyway, the words do not need to be gendered "cuz de gurls n' de paytriarchy". Dudette is basically a extension of dude, so, no originality and cringeworthy. 

Just play, for fuck sake. Or call people by their usernames.
Just fuck me up fam.
CRIIIINNNNGGGGEEEE
The water bit gets me ever time
2:34 YO ETHAN YOU CANNOT REACT LIKE THAT OR THIS VIDEO WILL GET TAKEN DOWN
this guy cut his hair for this vid

talk about DEDICATION


fucking love you ethan
Artosis?
this dude reminds me of Kenny Hotz 😂
Ever virgin
cs:go!!
He's advertising gaming cleaner and used the screen spray to clean a MAC SCREEN!
9:19 15 minutes into Gamer Gear and chill and he gives you this look
edgy stuff m8
2:38 React™
2:37 FineBros: See™ Your™ Bitch™ Ass™ In™ Court™

The uncomfortable width between this guy's eyes makes me want to punch his face.
take a disinfecting wipe wrap it around a card from your wallet and wipe through the spaces between the keys.
your gonna get copyrighted now by the fine bros, you said REACT 2:38
Fucking up your hair.. fucking up your keyboard..
now THAT's what i call production value.
2:39 you can't say that it's trademarked
2:39 , Careful you might get sue'd
That’s not Comic Sans, it’s Chalkboard.

I love this channel but honestly FUCK THIS INTO
you used autonoob... you are my enemy, just wait to me to get the bowl cut and 1v1 me on a private 128 tick server -  AWP only (i win i am global elite and you are like in the bottom silvers)

Holy shit the giggling at the end sounded like it was coming from my hallway and scared the hell out of me 😂
Ooooooohhh planet rangers!!
'Thanks Mr on the spectrum 😂'
That video made me sweat so much I died from dehydration
I got aids from watching that kid
Cringe-o-meter exploded!!!
Cringeworthy I died watching this.
Oh no, don't react! You'll have to pay 60% of your ad revenue!
HAHAHA omg i fucking died! nice vid
2:36 be careful saying react, fine bros will get their lawyers ready
this guy in the ad smh SUCH A NERD
Only fuckin guy that makes me "lol" on YouTube. Can you make some shitty fruit of the loom tee shirts merch with your daft face and some comic sans text so I can be a hipster cunt k cheers.
This looks like a weird intro to a discussion about our Savior.
"Game Assassins, bbluuurrrghggh. wtf, that made me  . . . React." Be careful the fine bros might sue you man.
2:38 finebros own you then
The broccoli assassin bit made me cry out of laughter lol.
you remind me of Summit1g <3
I can't believe I just watched a 4:19 minute add that i could not skip, worth it.
REALLY.EXE
This gamer gear kid reminds me of equally cringe-worthy ex host of "=3" on RayWilliamJohnson's channel, "Robbie".
"How do I do it? "Just. Just fuck me up. Just fuck me up, fam."
When bae has the same keyboard as you 100 100
2:38 EASY THERE ETHAN, the fine bros will sue no matter what
Isnt that guy in rocket jump shorts? Freddy wong's group? There is a guy that kind of looks like him
Really?
rEally?
reAlly?
reaLly?
realLy?
reallY?
         ?
I'm fucking dead.
This isn't a viable reaction, as he used REGULAR AIR, NOT GAMER AIR.
Easily their best video ever
Thanks to Dust Off my house has never been cleaner

Gamer Gear to the rescue
its funny because the "bowl" cut looks goods.
2:37 "that made me react"
Finebros: [Heavy breathing]
REALLY?!
he looks like a less threatening Ross O'Donovan
I would have gotten so fucked up off that computer duster
the ending tripped me out
the laughing sounds in the end of the video sounds like it's coming off your headphones, i literally shat myself.
You and Chadtronic are amazing!!!!!
The broccoli assassin look makes you look like Sam Pepper.
Fuck that guy.
2:38 Careful, Ethan... The Brothers are coming for your soul...
You literally ripped the piss out of this 😂😂😂
Dudette
This guy's fucking hilarious
Fucking sick!

2:39 Careful with that word bud dont want the fine bros suing you.
Hila doesn't put out man I feel sorry for you xD
Joel?
No gamer would ever talk like this. Or am i doing something wrong?
Even as a joke this was so painful to watch. Rip keyboard
I've been a gamer for years.... I eat on the computer and I've never gotten that much shit in my keyboard.
Really?
I hate the word "Gamer"
It's stupid as hell.
Just because I play videogames that somehow makes me a gamer?
I'm so fuckin happy I found your channel
"Thanks Mr. On The Spectrum"

LMFAO
2:37 You're not allowed to react man, TheFineBros are gonna sue.
this man is the white aziz Ansari
Still vine boarding
1 this is one of the only gud reaction channels 2 I'm on mobile typing this while riding a vineboard
Finebros comin to take this vid down lol
Nerd roasts, quite interesting.
I nearly closed this video from cringe before I remembered I was watching a reaction video.
It hurts. It hurts so bad.
@2:39 FineBros are gonna sue you, better watch out.
The giggling caught me off guard. Damn it.
This guy reminds me of Tim Heidecker
"This water is pulsing with energy!"
RRRRRRRRREALLY!!!
This is why Ethan and Hila will never be judged for reaction videos cause they do shit no other reactors would
im like convulsing in class trying not to laugh expecially when he poored food on the key board
amount of neck is too damn high!
HUGO BEDWIG
That made you... React? That's it, I'm calling Phine Brows
Really
2:38 THE FINE BROS ARE AFTER U !!! U REACTED
Why was it framed like a shamwow commercial
At 9:23 Is he trying to act like the fucking Engineer from Team Fortress 2
I wonder how many looked up the word "splooge" while watching this.
Dude you lied to all of us. Turning my air can upside down didn't help or make it look super cool, it fucked my shit up! UNSUB! No seriously I think your hilarious. Keep up the good work man!
7:45 the cringe, i felt it, my whole body cringing with pure cringe mhmhmmhhh
6:28 jk
REALLY
you should do a reaction video on Dillon the hacker
h3h3Production is HowToBasic Confirmed!!!!
Wipes off Mac with baby wipe
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS WRONG
I kinda really want to kill that cleaning stuff guy.
Gamer gear cleaning but the computer that the gamer dude is cleaning off is a Mac...
Shows an iMac, calls it a screen, and then moves onto the computer... okay, then.
And thats why h3h3 got a new keyboard under "business expenses"
Has anybody ever done 5:50 to their hand? It feels pretty good.
Is this where Big Bang Theory goes to make new scripts?
i like how you say "thanks" while showing "jk" on the keyboard LMAO
0:26 when you laugh so hard you need to lay down
well, at least i'm not the only one with the K120 keyboard
3 minutes in, fuckin dying, love your content guys!
Pewdiepie doesn't have enough money yet?
cleaner ganger
really
I've been hearing about this Chanel for awhile, glad I finally checked it out this guys hilarious
Woah Ethan... Ibuypower? Ah hell yeah. That is what you put the "gamer gunk" on right? An IBP keyboard?
thanks ethan, i almost choked on a piece of apple i was chewing while watching the hair cutting segment
what I really cant understand is how does Hila go about recording these videos not breaking into laughter every 10 seconds.
0:25 LMMMAAOOO
Have you guys really never had sex?
Isn't that gabuscus?
"Planet Rangers" What the fuck? This guy time- travelled from fucking 80's or what?
this has to me all time favorite video (REAAALLY) you give my life meaning ethan😭, keep it up
this guy is retarded
His face looks like that sloth Sid from ice age smh
Does Ethan's intro remind anyone else of Passion Pit's song Carried away?
After the first 30 seconds I thought I was watching a Papa Franku clone.
"Thanks Mr. 'on the spectrum'."

I had tears in my eyes and I was literally clutching my sides laughing. It was just the deadpan look on Uncle Ethan's face and that dry, edgy tone in his voice. It was truly majestic!
This is why i have adblock
the dude in the video must be a total loser lmfao
CHADTRONIC!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!?!?
I've never liked reacting videos, but I like these
How old is Ethan?
The giggling scared me
awr u cwazy awr u ouwta yow mounds
Groovy.
I actually wonder what the difference is between regular Dust Off, and Gamer Dust Off.
THIS SHIT IS SO FUNNY
Holy shit that giggling fucked me up.
God damn that Comic Sans warning is still one of his funniest bits.
One of the funniest videos I've ever seen, bravo
So that's what Husky has been doing...

That lazy bastard!

These are too funny for me to be watching in public 😂
Gaming's my main hobby.........ewww...
8:49 Only true game assassins use iMacs.

#iMacmasterrace

I feel like he was inspired by chadtronic in some way.
here is the gamer guys twitter go troll him https://twitter.com/mtomasetti
This is so cringe
your video editing is pretty good man, nice job :-)
he has the same keyboard as me. subscribed
9:07 instant death
😶 o my fucking got
its 12 am on a friday morning and everyone in my house is sleeping and im just in my room silently dying
The Dust Off Guy's humor is basically exactly the same brand of humor as the Mormons. Not making a joke, was born in that religion and dealt with it for years. Totally spot on
I have never cringed and laughed so much in my life
Haha that shitty Ibuypower M+K!
Holy shit the cringe ...
xXx.,R34LLYn0sK0p3DcL3aN3R,.xXx
poor keyboard :(
wow i'm really impressed by the cleaningpower of this product
I honestly hate YouTube. Jinx gets 1.5 million and does nothing but stare at a screen while you work hard and edit everything and only get 700k. And Chadtronic only gets 170k
:( You and Chadtronic deserve over a million
Thanks Mr. on the spectrum. i fucking die everytime
How can you say "Ginger" with the solid G?
thanks Mr on the spectrum!

"Ohhhh the games people play"
Comic sans!?!?! Does that mean your gonna have a bad time
GAMING ASSASSIN PRANK GONE SEXUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
I swear I watched this 17 times!
When he said "Just fuck me up fam" and she had a huge grin on her face while holding the hair clipper. I knew something horrible was going to come out of this.
this source feels like Tim and Eric.
The funny thing is this ad probably made them more money than a normal ad would because a bunch of people probably bought this as a joke
Bruh
How would you even hold an accordion like that
Wow, Ethan great moves keep it up, proud of you
What does Ethan do for a living? I mean i see some videos where he is hanging out in Israel and i'm thinking "this dude fucks". My conclusion is that he and sean are secret hitmen for the u.s government in Israel taking out ex-mossad who is about to defect to russia. He married this Israeli chick to get closer to ex-mossad agents who defected from Israel to Russia and who are now russian spies in america. I mean they randomly just moved to NYC. Yup, Ethan and Sean TOP CIA Assassins! Taking out ex-mossad and russian FSB agents in the U.S to protect their country! MURICA!
"Now for the SCARY PART!"
You mean that wasn't it three seconds ago?
LOLOLOLOL, fuck...that gamer water though. I need to get on that GAYMER WATER TIP
How can anyone dislike this? Its got all the new hip cool things in it, broccoli, haircuts, broccoli haircuts, nacho dip, doritos, gamer gear, gamer keyboards, and even ethan himself.
Alright so how do I do it?

Just fuck me up, fuck me up fam 

Hahaha
I actually like comic sans
REALLY
"REALLY!!!"
awesome and hilarious video
Really?!
This is by far one of the most funny videos I've seen! This is one of my favorite videos of H3H3! Keep doing what your doing, keeping entertaining people dude
somebody out there is that boi's suger daddy
haha broccoli cut more like undercut
The gaming assasin looks like a fucking sims pedestrian
Dude I've watched this like 5 times between today and yesterday it's so hilarious, the commercial is ridiculously hilarious and ya'll are great man
You can also just takeout the keys and use q tips, it's what most people do
This is definitely in my top 3 h3h3 videos
R-R-R-R-R-REALLYY ?
I used my headphones to watch this and i could hear a third really disturbing giggle during the "happy to be cleaned part"
This is by far the best h3h3 video ever created
i didnt know you could get cancer that many times
well u r too jewish to get a bowl cut
Paragraph thanking this channel and bringing up some family death and saying its helped me get through my day  

Now fucking notice me. COMMENT ON THIS FUCKING POST H3H3.
That kid is so cringe-worthy i was hiding under my desk until it ended
Jinx has more subs than h3h3 :/
"Gamer Gunk"
"Greasy, sticky, slimy game residue"



( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
is it just me or this guy look like he does crack
Don't market this as a product that makes you amazing here's what the ad should say. IT CLEANS YOUR DIRTY DORITO DUST COVERD SHIT. Profit
You're always trying to be funny but you look like pice of shit!
"Thanks Mr on the spectrum" absolutely kills me, love it
Intro= 90's show
Anyone catch that only the jk was clean after he said that at 6:28
I fucking died dude
Thanks Mr. On The Spectrum
oh my gosh i died
from 0:23 to 0:30 this video is already a masterpiece.
That's a good way to dispose of your $5 keyboard. I have that one too.
Ethan is the only Jewish exception
Hahahahahahahahahahahhahahaha I died.
+WinterFreSh00 REALLY
I died so fucking hard watching this video
6:01 CSGO DUST 2 A SITE
I love this guy, not one of his videos have i not laughed. He looks like russell peters if he was white XD
Dude U Forgotten about the 8000$ Gaming Chair Bruhh
"Just fuck me up fam"
I literally have ethans hair after he cut it
that haircut doesnt look that bad on a fat jew asshole like you
This is a masterpiece
REALLY?
10:00

WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT NOISE

IS THAT PART OF THE VIDEO OR IS A MONSTER ABOUT TO KILL ME TO MY LEFT
I fucking died when he gagged at the "game assassins" part
Bought 50 cans of dust off gaming gear... I'm never gonna regret it... My shoes have never been cleaner...
8:52 That's a Mac.
So much better than Jinx
7:24... 'you have to be insulted by how dumb they think we are.' that statement is so fucking ironic. some of us gamers (the morons) buy shit like microstransactions and DLC and you're insulted by them trying to play us like chumps when we basically do it by ourselves? xD
That keyboard made me hungry
how do you do that effect on the intro of your videos?
Would someone have the courtesy to offer explanation as to what Ethan said after "thanks, Mr (something)? It would be much appreciated, Papa John bless.
The laughter freaked me the fuck out dude, I felt like it was coming from behind me.
Pretty sure this kid grew up to become Mr. Caffeine "Tom Clahancy" pitch man
I wanna huff that Gamer Gear can
He looks like the Weeknd with that Haircut 😂
Comic Sans Warning,,,

Anybody? ;)
"You can't do it dirty, you gotta do it clean."
To me the looked like Sid from ice age when he was in the thumbnail.
The length of his neck is really freaking me out.
"Thanks Mr. On-the-spectrum." Ethan is a comedy genius
CLEANER GINGER. TO CLEAN YOUR GAMER GUNK
OH god. died laughing.
Thats how you use gamer gunk cleaner ginger XDXD IM DEAD
Maaan I was on the toilet watching this and I was laughing so hard, I shit faster. Thanks H3!
Maximum cringe
8:16 made me laugh like a retard for 15 minutes
Brilliant
8:18 I think he's playing Call of Kombat: Armageddon 2
so funny!
I say really REALLY all the time now
the cringe is too strong
Is it strange that I think your wife looks exactly like Anne Frank
I love this guy, but his intro makes me cringe
I haven't played Undertale yet but I already hate Sans. First it was because he was dating Toriel, but Comic Sans only adds up to it.
R-R-R-R-REALLY?!

* inb4 angry comments from NASA employees who support Comic Sans :v *
so fugin gold
How much did this guy get for marketing this shit?
I think we have the same desk... diud you get that from Target?
I can't be the only one that gets kinda freaked out by the giggling, right?
Yay he plays csgo!
9:00 I'd hit it.
Man, I just couldn't stop laughing.
@Nathan you should do the "DO IT" by shia labeouf commentary xD
Just fuck me up... XD
That keyboard and mouse destruction made me cry a little
When even the beginning of the video makes you loose your shit! I lost it when he introduced gamer water xD
WATCHING THIS AT 4 AM, I HAVE FUCKING SURROUND SOUND ON MY HEADSET AND THE FUCKING LAUGHING CAME FROM BEHIND ME AND I SCREAMED
they were cleaning a mac i think,  MACS ARE NOT FOR GAMING!
@10:03...headphones at night. no lights. thought someone in the house was having night crazies
@10:03...headphones at night. no lights. thought someone in the house was having night crazies
When i heard the guy say, "FINSH HIM!" I had a brain aneurysm and passed out.
This video is funny af.
How does a disk clean an optic drive
Holy shit the cringe. This advert was clearly written by someone who's never touched a videogame in their life. I feel kinda bad for the guy though.
The actor's name is Michael Tomasetti he has a channel here by the same name
Man this is funny stuff, this should be on comedy central
nice nova dood.

The broccoli assassin is one of the funniest things I've ever seen!
It's funny and all but I hope the paid the guy in that video really fucking well. And they probably didn't. But he deserves it.
This dudette literally got a bowl cut.... WTF!
i thought the dont clone yourself warning was his editing... then i saw it was in the actual video and i cringed with the force of a thousand cringes.
watching this after that god-awful jinx channel gives me hope.
"Gaming Gunk Cleaner Ginger"

I'm wearing  headphones, so when that demented giggling started up I literally jumped out of my chair.
Wooooo CS:GO
For some reason I feel bad for that guy in the ad
LMFAO 4:51
Destroying that keyboard with gamer gunk killed me inside.
Clean CDs, just slide them in and they will start giggle :)
Wait what are we cleaning again?
His hair looks similar to that of year 8's that listen to grime on the playground
666,666 SUBSCRIBERS ?

GAMER WATER PULSING WITH ENERGY!
Pause at 7:01

Don't tell me I can't do it dirty.  Fuck you.  You don't know me.  You don't know my life.
That gamer gear guy looks kinda like Jenna Marbles lol

I nearly died, this is so cringy
Kill it before it lays eggs!
Nice, following the bandwagon that disapproves of a font.  A FUCKING FONT.  In your next video, can you "baaaaah" like a sheep?
gamer water personally blessed by papa himself
This Channel... It's like Jack Black and Aziz Ansari had a baby, a meteor shower happened and awesome happened. Really.
Why is the comic sans a big deal
RIP keyboard.
He grew his hair back in 3 minutes
K
Why is the person he's laughing at looks fucking beautiful
4:57 That needs to be a JPEG!

"Just fuck me up, fuck me up fam"

Best quote of 2015
can anybody make a sound clip for the "really!!!" part?
That giggle at 5:48. Ethan you are like a kid who found something amazing with that giggle.
5:35 I laughed hard as fuck at this
"Game Assassins"

The cringe... I can't breatheeeee......
I saw this same guy acting in a used car commercial, not as cringe, but close.
WHAT RANK ARE U BRAHHH??
"I gotta squint to look at this shit"
shit belongs on kickstarter crap
For real thoe I have dust on the back of my PC what do I do!
looks like a fuckin muffin
10:02 scared the shit outta me. The audio affect on my ear buds for some reason worked very well. little 2 spooky for my taste.
did they just take the guy in this ad straight out of a cyrogenic freezing chamber sealed since the 90's? all he's missing is some rollerskates and timeless catchphrases like RADICAL and TUBULAR!
I NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY DAMN ASS LIFE
gees what a cringe fest
I love how Ethan has trouble saying gamer gear and gaming gunk and tongue twisters it.
Hahaha
his neck is like 1 mile between his face and shoulders
....He did pull off a drag pretty good....just sayin'
4:58 looks exactly like nickbunyun
I was actually kind of impressed at how much cheese dip a can of air blew out of his keyboard
This was a thousand times more inspirational than the homless videos.
i wish that the fgts that made the ad would 1v1 me rust. they would take A INTERVENTION TO TJE FUCKING ASS.

Just found this channel today. I love it. ITS A FACT!
Really?
TRIGGERED HE TOOK OFF THE GAMER GLASSES WHILE GETTING A HAIR CUT
oh the things people comment... REALLY
5:01 LMAOOOOO
ARE YOU CRAZY? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
I swear I watched this one 17 times
STAR_
you have a new subscriber here
WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE KOOTRA
Really?
The cringe is too strong
So stupid how people actually fall for these crap products. It's just original Dust Off at double the price with "Gaming Gear Duster" as the title of the can. It's so stupid. It's so freaking stupid. I wonder which is dumber though, the crap commercial for the crap product or the crap product itself?
Can someone please make a 3-second video clip of the guy saying "Really?!" and upload it on youtube?
funny how ethan didn't like the broccoli assassin cut but that's a legitimate hairstyle i see a lot of dudes (and dudettes) with
"Make sure your computer is off. Not hibernating, but completely O-F-F."

Thanks man, I was just about to replace the motherboard while the PC was on
Man, i love this episode!
Mr. On The Spectrum oh my God I haven't laughed this hard in almost a year.

Papa Bless
4:50 Killed me, that is my exact same iBUYPOWER keyboard and mouse
the guy doesn't even seem to get that the competitive games are infact, multiplayer.
I'M LAUGHING SO HARD
I thought it was Husky in the thumbnail.
great moves! proud of you!
good to know h3h3 is a member of the master race.
How could someone do this to his own keyboard?
Hair? I can get behind that. But keyboard?! F*ck me, dude(and "dudette", srsly how in the seven hells do you spell that)!
I've had a better opinion of you!
Dislikeunsubscribedonewiththeyoutube!
0:26
That guy looks like a fucking giraffe
this guy kills me
That guy looks like a younger version of a girl I know's dad....
to be fair, it did clean away the game residue from where u sprayed it initially. now for a small loan of a million dollars the rest of the keyboard can be clean
Just making sure to comment on a piece of history. This is it guys, the best video on youtube and your chance to be a part of it for the next generations to come.
9:00 I'm dead
CRRRRRRINGGGEEEE
This guy isn't funny. the vids he reacts to are
The bowl cut game assassin..
That's cringe personified.
That guy really stretched his acting for the camera 1 class to the upmost limits.
dudett
Broccoli assasain, IM FUCKING DEAD.
Dudat... Really really really :O xDDDD
I should study for my finals...but I´m laughing so hard I just can´t :D Best youtube channel ever

Ethan build your own pc man cmon
YOU FUCKING POURED CHEESE SAUCE ON KEYBOARD
Comic Sans Warning! lol
my first h3h3 video... and I had probably watched this video like for the 10th time
I feel bad for the actor, he most likely did not write the script but people are going to remember him for this shit.
HOLY SHIT!!! yo watch their first video called wiping from two years ago and then watch this. Ethan's hair has gotten really grey.
Listened to 10:00 with headphones in and I freaked the fuck out
Comic sans warning!  Appreciate the heads up
0:27 I was done hahahahahahah
it's just a prank bro
+h3h3Productions Can you guys do a reaction video on this guy called Kurt Coleman. You won't regret it.
2:08 "We need to put that in there even though it doesn't f-- 'REALLY' fit!"

great move ethan
Still, trying to figure out how the advertisers are so dumb to think this will appeal to their target audience.
The sad thing is, the products he made fun of at the beginning are based off of real things.
Really!
Wow Ethan great moves, keep it up. proud of you
I have the exact same keyboard as Ethan. What is this witchcraft?
0:14

GO NAVI
Seriously, are you Mac DeMarco or not?
its a facted
RIP keyboard and mouse
"Just fuck me up fam" 

-Ethan 2015
This is the first video I have watched from h3h3 and this made me confused. But now, I'm subscribed.
I can relate to the accordion part as i play accordion! Thanks for an anology that only 0.1% will understand and relate to!
I just squeezed my gamer sploodge all over the screen. Now I'll use my gamer gear wipe you wipe it off. Thx h3h3 productions! You helped a lot!
When he said mom would be so proud I cringed so much 😂😂😬😬
I like ur videos just hate the intro it looks like a 80's show
Ha ha
Pussy went with Cyberpower
For real though, great content man, just build something yourself.
what is background music, I recognise it but I cant remember what it is...
Best youtuber ever
What the hell was that white dot on his eye in the monitor reflection at 8:50? It looked like an editing mistake, like they put his face on the monitor in post. Damn this entire concept is ridiculous. If you need a disc with onscreen instructions to tell you how to clean something, don't reproduce.
h3h3 looks like if Tai Lopez and Aziz Ansari had a baby
This is EXE as fuck
0:27 Is that guys shirt fucking waterproof?
The cringe is real
Ethan would be the perfect homeless alcoholic, but he's also good at being a comedian
5:55 
I can't wait to get a can of  Gamer Gunk Cleaner Ghinger™ to clean my gamer gunk
showed this to my mum, she had no comments.
Lucky I have not yet hit puberty so I don't have this "gamer residue" ... Wait! THIS IS PUBLIC?!
can someone tell me how "disc cleaners" clean the disc drive? never understood it
"Thanks, mr on the spectrum"
i thought that giggling was behind me lol
Brockley cut I killed myself laughing .

I wanted to see the original video, but I can't, I really can't. There's so much cringe I can barely watch this video.
There are starving kids in Africa that could be eating that keyboard
Holy shit the width of that gigging sound was scary. It sounded like it was behind me.
ive only recently started watching y'alls videos but im glad i did you guys are funny as shit. it is like a perfect mix of filthy frank, jontron, and tim & eric. great job.
how old is Ethan?
RLLY?!
REALLY!!!
He looks like he could be like 45.
Please someone just end me right now, i don't want to breathe the same air of that douchebag.
lol Brockley asasin
This video made me want to kill myself
This guy reminds me of Kenny Hotz from Kenny vs Spenny.
Stop playing these games god damn game assassins
i have watched this like 10 times, never gets old.
just press 9 to skip to the best part
that's not comic sans though.. 
but it's still ugly.
-an overly sensitive graphic design
Favorite one lmao watched so many times. " sign Introducing the broccoli assassin guys fuck me" lmfao

Wonder Showzen Jew Type of Edit, Good job ethan keep it up !!!

I still don't get the intro
Really.exe has crashed.
Anyone here from cashnastys stream?

lame, tim and eric rip off...
Really
why
is this for real ? i can't comprehend
the "thanks Mr. on-the-spectrum" comment is probably the hardest i've ever laughed at a youtube video
Love the intro xd
why do these videos not have ads on them
Where can i buy those gamer glasses that he used in the intro?
so he could be transgender because he had no adams apple
i'm glad i got the exact same screen than this guy.
THAT GUY IN THE FUCKING VIDEO IS ROSS FROM GAME GRUMPS! 😱😱😂😂
The broccoli cut, looks like Sam Peppers hair.
AHAHAHAHAHA
US GAMERS AM I RIGHT?
lol the reaction video has more views than the actual video
Mr. Safety = Engineer?
You know that's stupid company probably doesn't care: they paid some guy to make an idiot out of himself to market their stupid product, just to have him make fun of it. But he still bought it and they got the money.
Why did that guy look like Sid from ice age
You've got the same case as me!
And that's how you use Gamer Gunk Cleaner Geengur.
OMFG I LOST MY SHIT WHEN HE HELD IT UPSIDE DOWN!!! I'M FUCKING CRYING MY KIDNEYS ARE GOING TO EXPLODE MY SIDES HAVE LEFT FUCKING THE OUTER RIM!!!!!!!!!!!
the cringe in this video
Imagine if he spilled those doritos and con queso on a mechanical keyboard...
gamer water = gammalabs shit in a nutshell
0:23 cured my terminal ebola
7:51, one of the greatest shorts
Joel? Joel?
I'm trying to have a shit while watching this but I can't push because of the cringe
9:47
HOLY FUCKING SHIT I'M CRYING AND LAUGHING AND COUGHING AND SNEEZING AND URINATING AND SHITTING AND BASICALLY EXPLODING.
to make a YouTube video you must: 

1. Shave your head
2. Destroy a mouse and keyboard with Doritos
3. Sacrifice your first born
Technically, you only need one skin fragment to clone yourself.
Will this gamer gear help me level up? (reference to the Law & Order SVU on Gamers episode)
Ethan is best neckbeard 2016
Im not a game assassin im a "Broccoli Assassin" xD
The giggling part made me feel like I'm on LSD.
i see that csgo 😉
This video is fucking retarted
NaVi sticker lmao. Clearly iBuyPower is where it's at.
Wait... Is this the guy that AlphaTV use to hang out with back in like... Highschool or whatever? I heard about how Alpha use to do videos sorta like this one.
I have that keyboard he poured jizz into and its the best keyboard ive ever bought. DO RECOMMEND.
Cringe

I died at the water drinking. I drowned
That guy looks like if Ross O'Donovan and the youtube explained guy were blended together
You did'nt get to the "Cool Lazer Messes."
Where do you keep finding all of this cringe pls tell us!
How can a disk clean a dvd/cd/blu-ray player do they think we're fucking idiots.
That laughing towards the end scared me so much.
Children in Africa could've eaten that keyboard.
I wanna see where the man in this ad is. He must be so ashamed.
So happy to be clean! Thanks gamer-game-gamy-gamingrig-gambling-gamebusting games-gamecleaner-gamergamer-gaming-yatzydice assassins! Their compressed air contain an even higher percentage of air, than regular air! With more x-xx-x-xplosive oxygen!

PewPew! To both disinfecting alcohol and vacuum cleaner. Ismazing!
I kind of feel sorry for this guy...
JOEL.

JÖL DID YOU SLATHER DIP ON YOUR KEYBOARD AGAIN JOEL?

If I got payed each time he said stuff, I would be a rich man. Lel 😏
Am I the only one who was going crazy thinking the laughing was coming from around me?
The guy is so cringe worthy
I was laughing my ass off the entire video, but then again, I'm very easily amused.

How to properly clean your gaming gear: Remove power, get a tub of isopropl alchohol (80% and above) now use a wipe and the isopropl alchohol to clean everything.

"Thanks Mr. on the spectrum", FUCK THAT ALWAYS GETS ME lmao
Reminds me of Roby Motz.
really
what video editing software does he use?
this video feels like a fever dream
that guy reminds me of my 6 year old cousin
I'm not sure why but the face in the thumbnail cracks me up so bad.
Truktruk's advertising career is really going downhill.
dat bowl cut
This vid makes me laugh so hard and cringe way harder so I kind of suffer and enjoy at the same time. It's addictive, goddammit. Watching for the 5th time or something. The "game assassins, what the fuuuck" sound so honest. Oh man.
This video and the people who made it are just the scum of humanity
REALLY!? bitchc
FUCKING ROASTED !!! HAAAWWWWWW !!!
I think his hair in the intro is better than his hair in the new vids. yes homo
Ethan went full HowtoBasic on that shiz
This is fake
comic sans is love, comic sans is life
What is that intro dude lololololol
3:55 that actually looks awesome not even being sarcastic
the cringe is real
ARE U OUTTA UR MIND?
Jesus Christ. Both cans of air are from Dust Off. Furthermore, the normal duster from Dust Off has MORE AIR than the Gaming Gear duster, yet the latter costs more. Capitalism at its best.
thats not a bowl cut thats a sam pepper cut!
That kid is the human form of cancer
This is one of your best imo including the first soflo reaction video. Keep up the great work!
this video is so hilarious, i keep coming back to it just to see his reaction over again!
yo rank bro?
my cancer meter is off the charts. O. F. F. off
As soon as I saw you playing csgo you gained a new sub
THE CRINGE IS TOO STRONG
6:10 srs h3h3 you using auto

BOWL CUT GONE SEXUUUUUUAAAAALLLLL
"Thanks Mr. On the spectrum" fucking lel
Lmfao the giggling scared me
Dudette that broccoli haircut is REALLY
I'm Asian so I have perma-cringe eyes. This video made me blind when I cringed.
Bowlcut part pretty funny
8:17 I am dying
I can say as a game assassin that watching him destroy that fucking keyboard was the hardest thing ive ever attempted watching
can't do it dirty, gotta do it clean.... sounds like an add for anal bleaching
the cringe...
755 people thought the dislike button was dis i like
6:22 shout out too my waifu Rias.
congrats on one million
I can't help but think that whole gamer gear commercial was meant to be awkwardly funny.... like they were all sitting around trying to think of the worst commercial they could make and this came out of it..
hilas pussy smells like sweaty hummus
I can rarely say I legitimately laugh at youtube videos. Only h3h3 can make me do that.
This guy sounds the same as Robby Long Neck (=3)
i just shit my pants
I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. You missed the best joke though! He said turn the computer off, totally off then insert the CD! WTF? How? The computer is off. He never said anything else. Idk if maybe there was more you skipped cause it wasn't funny. (which I find hard to believe cause this is so ridiculous and hilarious.) but I picked up on that and immediately wondered what the fuck. Why tell us to turn the computer off if we need to put in a disc? Lol.
the game assassin line made me react too LOOOOOL
"Let's check with Mr. Safety."

"Shoot me."

"Thanks Mr. Safety!"
All the videos past this one. Ethan's been wearing hats....
ibp keyboards are shit anyway.
dude the 'really' face you make is too much, in cracking up.  subscribed
I love this channel.
REALLY?
3:41 - 4:09

Die every time.
Is that a Corsair Carbide case @ 9:59 ? I have one of those up and running @ my place too. Nice.
this video makes me feel sexually assaulted +1
hey it's ross
The cringe is too much
Really?
Ok so, i was watching this at 3 in the morning and the part where you hear all the giggling scared the absolute fuck out of me. I nearly shit myself. 10/10 spook of the year
ethan is an actual meme lord. He has invented multiple memes and reigns supreme over his territory of memedom.
"You put the bowl on your head, and you cut" I think I may die of cutting my wrist, and this bowl is really uncomfortable on my penis head.
REALLY!
REALLY!
9:07 i made the same reaction as ethan at the same time
No, i don't.

6:18 are you seriously using a auto-sniper -.-
6:15 ethan's a fucking autofag
UNSUBSCRIBE!!!!!!
This is my favorite video on the entire internet.
Really?
Hila should get a bowl cut.
is it just me that thinks that if he shaved his sides and not the front it would look really good?
Is this a bowl cut? or a BROCCOLI CUT? I'm not a game assassin, I'm a BROCCOLI ASSASSIN! XD XD XD XD XD
That giggle scared the shit out of me with my sorround headset.... Fak dude
This is the only channel that legitimately makes me laugh. Ethan is freaking hilarious

poor kid, got sucked into marketing, and now he's joined the ranks of tai lopez
Pause the video at exactly 6:08.
He plays CS:GO, I wonder what his rank is!!
the broccoli cut actually fits ethan pretty well.
the best part is zooming in on Mr. Safety's teeth saying o f f f f f f f f
Why are you so FUCKING FUNNY
Hila is hot.
"Just fuck me up" "just fuck me up fam" Omg that killed me, honestly the funniest thing i've heard in years.
To be fair if you do any renovating, FUCKING CEMENT GETS IN YOUR DAMN FANS!
After the bowl cut he looks like Jewish Sam Pepper.
I don't wanna live on this fucking planet anymore.
alot of you gay assassins
I love how the two clean keys in the "my house has never been cleaner" clip were 'j' and 'k'

The Gamer Gear guy dresses up as his own mom. Hands up, who's actually surprised?
best part is how he's in game playing CS while cleaning his nasty keyboard. sooo funny omg.
LISTEN HERE MOTHER FUCKER A STARVING AFRICAN CHILD COULD OF ATE THAT KEYBOARD
hibernation mode stores your session to your hdd or ssd, then powers off mr on the spectrum is far out
Your so funny😂😂😂
Turn off the computer. Then insert the CD and listen to it. While the computer is off, that is O-F-F.
Subbed for obnoxiousness.
Broccoli Assassin incoming
Really!
Take off your snow cap, you're indoors. Maybe pay for some central heating.
And when you said "what did they think this was comic genius" or whatever I'm misquoting, I think they were spot the fuck on. I can't tell you how many people I know watched this and laughed at how bad it was. There's no way something this bad was made with serious intent, they shot for "so bad it's good". Maybe a poor way to sell bullshit product, but funny nonetheless.
logitech k120 master race
Ethan plays with autosniper....fuck
R R R R R R Really?
7:18 LMFAO Yep.
5:00 LMFAO 
(7,00th comment.)
Your broccoli assassin haircut is basically The Weeknd
dust off removes dust(and hair and skin flakes count as dust cause it's not liquidy or stuck to the keyboard). so you using it like it was suppost to remove salse as if that is what it's purpose was, made you look worse.
Gamer.exe ?
8:16 was the best moment of my life

It's suggested that you get compressed air if you need to dust sensitive electronics, but you can find a good can of it for $3 at Office Depot.
You have my keyboard <3 great keyboard 10/10
intro had me rolling
2:30 oh no why

Do you squirt your energy into that Gamer Water? I really like your energy.
The Keyboard is trash and might have deserved it (even if it was a bit much) but the poor fallout on the table and monitor tho :(
Real talk:

Just the word "game" used as a verb puts a bad fucking taste in my mouth.

2:35 TRIGGERED
Ethan what camcorder do you use? and can you suggest one for around 300-400$?
THE CRINGE IN 8.17 IS TOO GODDAMN STRONG

Ethan Klein is The Postal Dude
Dude the giggling part was actually scary man.  I didn't think the video was making that noise.
Odell Beckham?
oh god... i cant watch
Holy crap this is gold. Subbed
I'm actually crying from laughing so hard at this
that guy looks like a stinky unwashed penis.
I've watched this one so many times and showed people, this is hilarious!
omg don't watch this while eating you'll spit your food everywhere
I feel like I go back to this video every day to watch it all over again. It's one of my favorites. Thanks for being so awesome Ethan!
At 6:25 he says "My gaming gear has never been cleaner!" and the only clean keys are "JK"
When he drinks the water and scream was hilarious
thanks man this really helped! but now my S key doesn't work...along with the d,a,f,g,h,j,k,l,z,x,c,v,b,n,m,q,w,e,r,t,y,u,i,o,p,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, along with the zero key as well, I typed this with my phone btw
I lost it when he said "broccoli cut"
The broccoli cut looks very similar to Sam Pepper's haircut. The broccoli looks way better though.
He did nail the gamer. He's completely awkward.

"I know, I read on Kotaku that it's better than Civ 5 with the Brave New World expansion pack."
The would make billions.
He kinda looked cool like that high key
<3
Literally laughing rolling on the floor.
For some reason I feel bad for the guy who acted in the Dust Off video.
Is it bad I recognized 90% of the stuff on those glasses?
Why does the ad guy kinda remind me of Ross from game grumps?
If I could clone myself, it would be the best thing ever happened to me. Two different jobs, twice the money in my bank, make a lot of friends, get more women phone numbers. Either only one sleeps while another works or one works while another does nothing all day. It's a win win!
My mouse and QWER keys have a coat of gunk on them.
i feel like i just ate 5 lemons
Thank you h3h3 productions. I took a break from studying for my college finals and watched some of your videos. They made me laugh my ass off and feel better.

The cringe is strong with this one.... damn...must've been difficult to review. Just recently discovered this brilliant channel, laying the shit on these narcissists, phoneys and hypocrites. You're one funny ass dude, Ethan. I rarely crack up over anything, but this content is just too hilarious and excellent social commentary, all at the same time. Peace!

Note to self: Never watch h3h3 high,

I turned my PC off then tried to use the cd drive cleaner but it's not doing anything, how long before I hear laughter? Any help appreciated, thanks

Hey, I'm on the spectrum. That guy's painting a bad image of my kind.
5:49 that laughed fucking killed me. Love your vids man
How could you do that to your keyboard?
I dont know why but sometimes Ethan reminds me of Kenny Hotz
are you crazy are you out of your mind!?
I have the same monitor as Ethan :)
"Willy"
Among the thousands of talentless hacks on the Youtube, this dude is actually entertaining and fun to watch.
the keyboard he used before and after putting dip on is different so dont worry he probably just took a keyboard that didnt work
Implying all gamers are greasy neck beards. If u eat food and touch stuff without washing ur hands ur a proper idiot
10:03 that laughing  scared me so much, im alone in my room and its dark.

Holy shit the giggling part scared the shit out of me. I thought the noise was real and I threw my headphones off and broke them.
so happy to be cleaned

rerererereally
YOU ACTUALLY CUT YOUR HAIR HAHA I LOVE YOU
This guy is either disgustingly Jewish or disgustingly Italian, either way he's intolerable
This reminds me of skits in movies from the 90s where some old guys in Hollywood would write a script and then pay some young guy to read it and advertise their shitty product. After the job was done the young guy would go smoke his bong and just be like "yeah I need the money and something for my resume, I'd never buy that shit". Oh how relevant that is to this day. Guarantee it's the exact scenario with this kid.
Broly is a broccoli assassin too.
there hasn't been one video on this channel that I haven't laughed (a lot) while watching.
Looks like Sam Pepper with that bowl cut... ;)
That ass!
Is that a googly eye on the wall in the beginning?
Holy fuck I was alone downstairs and the "you can hear it giggling" part made me have a fucking heart attack

JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! MY HEADPHONES CAME OFF WHEN HE SAID "GREASY STICK SLIMY" IM SO LUCKY MY BROTHER WAS DOWNSTAIRS
Thanks Mr. On the Spectrum lmao
REALLY?!
LOLOLOL THAT GAMING GEAR CLEANER...... Reminds me of when I spilled my dinner of cheese, ham, mash potatoes, watermelon, Danish, cinnamon toast crunch, Taco Bell, KFC, Wendys, My Thanksgiving Turkey, Birthday Cake, White Mountain Dew, Red Mountain Dew, Cool Ranch Doritos, my cat, my dog, my fish and my parakeet all on my keyboard. My friend says wow we will never clean this up. And I'm just like REALLY!!!! I just used the gaming gear spray and at least my ctrl, alt, and delete buttons work! Man we were relieved that day and we thank god for gaming gear every time we breathe. OH ITS GOOD TO BE ALIVE!
press play and spam 4on mu pad

WHO THE FUCK MAKES THIS ADS LIKE THIS IS FUCKING WORSE THAN JAPAN
When he said splooge before the keyboard part I cried of laughter.
The guy from the original video sounds like he has 0 knowledge about games and he has to rehearse the names of games so he doesn't fuck it up xD
Omg this was the funniest reaction i believe.
This man is a savage 😂😂😂😂 I love Ethan
"Just fuk me up fam"

"RRREAAALY?!"
"PHEW PHEW PHEW PHEW PHEW FINISH HIM"
9:44

Did you see that?. He tipped his yellow fedora.

Yellow is made out of Red and Green. Red is the Color of blood.
Green is the color of illuminati.

he only wore one fedora. the illuminati symbol has one eye. humans have 2 eyes.
two is made out of 3 letters.
this is becoming edgy but lets continue.. a triangle has 3 edges. illuminati is a triangle. illuminati confirmed.
#halfrommegamind
ethan sounds like prinny
dood
Who the fuck says "dudettes"?
Whats the difference between the way the guy acts in the commercial, and the way the characters act in every disney sitcom
I cant tell, can someone point out a difference?
'Thanks mr on the spectrum' fucked me up oh lawwwwd
Channel really blowing up Uncle E.
i actually feel sorry for that gamer gear guy, he seems like a guy who's trying to be an actor and this was just another job..........little did he know his career would be tainted forever..........luckily my career is not tainted because i use gamer-wipe to clean all that childhood abuse and neglect right off my life - get yours now!! only $40 more than your average paper towel
I've never seen a video from this channel, but I thought that chick and dude was Kristen Wiig and Mose from The Office.

This man's life is ruined for being in such a stupid ad :P

You guys should react to Vegan Gains.
I'm dying of laughter!! :'D
that's the so called 'pro gamers'. They'll buy anything for any price as long as you slap "pro gamer" on the label. I cant believe the idiots who buy mice and keyboards for over 30$ just for LEDs and extra buttons aswell as a label that they think makes them better at the games they play...
seriously thought the sound at 10:00 were just besides me... 7.1 pls

"5:08" "Comic Sans alert" Sans! What are you doing in this video, this isn't Undertale!

How's Papyrus?
I like how Ethan has a secret club that only the elite of youtube are in AKA everyone comments and everyone channels which is cool to see that your favorite youtuber acknowledge there existence of eachother
I think the cringest part of this video is that Ethan has a prebuilt PC from CyberPower
☼☜✌☹☹✡
ETHAN! ARE YOU CRAZY? ARE YOU OUTTA YOUR MOIND?
I unsubbed your hat is not blue 0/10
Why does hela look like Maggie off the walking dead ?
I wonder where this guy is now.
I have never cringed harder.
Is your wife a Jew
That "REALLY?" just came out of no where I feel like he was shocked to something I didn't even say.
please do a reaction video of sim jesus
your channel makes me laugh so much that i white listed you on add block - you deserve every cent man
ethan looks fly in that high top brocoli fade tho
I FUCKING LOST IT AT COMICSANS
At 1:26 Ethan sounds like the guy from those old Kanye West album skits "Yes, I've never had sex, but my degree keeps me satisfied"
Did the intro seem faster to you guys?
5:48 Dat laugh tho
Ethan. You need to check out the channel helpmefindmyparents, it suits your style of vids
I just realized the keyboard he used in the video is the same as mine
i havent laughed so hard since the last video
*cough cough
Burtgasm just uploaded a school shooting in Minecraft, it is blowing up pretty quickly.
Lol @ Tai lopez ad for this video
Yo Ethan, there's this minecraft youtuber who made a school shooting roleplay video in minecraft. His name is BurtGasm.
LMAO HIS PLAYING CS:GO WHAT IS YOUR STEAM ACC ETHAN
1:43 I'm pretty sure that "no" is an audio clip edited in the video and not actually in the original video itself.
This is my first h3h3Productions video.
I'll tell ya, I was confused as fuck.
Can you do a cringe reaction to MattyB raps (I reccomend the "Talk Dirty" cover for maximum cringes) TRIGGER WARING Check his AIDS fanbase in the comment section of hus videos for guaranteed chromosomes
fun fact: a little while ago, ethan and jontron were on some guys csgo stream. it was great.
You should get a p.o. box
3:42 xD reminds me of the ridiculous hairstyles European footballers sometimes have. Well, and the dumb kids that try to copy them...

I need to clean my rad and fad gaming gear bro dude man

I laughed so hard a this video. New subscriber.
DID YOU KNOW BFVSGF "PRANK VLOG" CHANNEL MENTIONED YOU GUYS AT THEIR VLOG TODAY?????????
XDDDDD, THEY WERE PLAYING YOUR INTRO SONG.

pls read ethan u cunt
Ethan I beg you to take a look at Faze Censor. It's bad enough that this fucker plays COD professionally, but he makes some of the cringiest videos I've ever laid eyes on. The guy ate nothing but peanut butter sandwiches throughout his childhood, so he makes videos of himself eating common foods like pickles and cheeseburgers and pouts like a baby throughout all of it. To top it off, he's the most stereotypical online douche-bag there is. Please Ethan, this would complete my life, and I can imagine your hilarious reactions.
Oh fuck yeah, I love this one!
1v1 me in csgo
Ethan god please can you do a vid on shoe nice. i have recently come into contact with shoe nice and have learned that he is one of the most cancerous people on the internet, he is even worse than matty b. Please ethan do the right thing and be my knight in shining armor and come and save me from this hell, and by that i mean make a vid about how cringe he is PLEASE IT NEEDS TO BE DONE
next time i get a hair cut ima say "just fuck me up fam"
BROCCOLI ASSASSIN LOL
can someone explain what this video is?
Please react to Key fork TV!
I swear i love these videos . They make me die.
So wait. I can be MLG!? With dust off!?
My god.

This is pure cringe.
I need to tell you how fucking funny your sexy horny ass. I told my slutty as friend about it and he laughed his tight hole off with it, your a excellent comedian needless to say! 

Wow Ethan, Great moves, keep up, Proud of you :)

Okay now I want you to keep doing what your doing cos your blumin hilarious. I can see that when you get famous so many people will love your sexy ass off. Now be safe by Dudat.

Also just a Request: Rapping for Jesus. Your welcome Ethen and keep up the work :)

How the fuck do you specially formulate compressed air?
my biggest wish is  you 2 to be my parents.
I literally laughed to tears
Does anyone else see a white Aziz Ansari? Please, anyone?
h3h3 I have to say thank you for exposing this kind of cringeworthy stuff, not just this but also the dipsticks of YouTube people like PrankInvasion, SoFloAntonio etc... I personally can't stand their content not only is it wrong it's also dangerous because kids are starting to imitate them and get into trouble (Difference is they're not using paid actors from Craigslist or something). I want channels like that down to the point where everyone will forget about them but the good news is that channels like you are doing your best to get the message out that this is fake and should not be taken for real not just you but people like Boogie2988, Pyrocynical and Marcus Dibble (he did a fantastic callout of SoFloAntonio btw I reccomend you go check it out ). Hopefully those kinds of channels will lose their credibility someday. We'll just have to wait :) (Sorry if made a couple of grammar errors)
10:03 that fucking sound illusion doe
That guy is a fucking giraffe.
what's wrong with wearing glasses to improve my game? I don't get anything out of winning video games so I'm going to spend as much money as I can to get the edge

hahahaha h3h3 has a prebuilt!
I like how his hair gets long again halfway through the video.
Ethan, you NEED to do a video on clockwork cyborg! He is like the ultimate douchebag. And his "i'm back" video is ultimate cringe. Oh my god, seeing you do a video on him would be fucking golden!
The words "gamer gunk cleaner gingrr" made my chub fall out of it's tuck lollllll
I am your child
The length of his neck is really spooky

Just a warning about tilting those cans upside down and using them. that fluid is EXTREMELY flammable. The smallest of sparks will set it off. The gasses from it being burnt is extremely dangerous too. I lost my eyelashes and the rest of my facial hair from it.
I've been triggered
Wtf the laugh actually scared me
You should react to: Barrybeetv
Alex jones channel

that actually looks awesome, nice hair!
Man remember when Joel did this
Would you consider cutting the "REALLY?!" repeat scene into one of your other videos some day? Just randomly cut it in without making a big deal about it when there's an extra cringey part of a video that you're doing a reaction on.
Ethan the mess you made triggered me
Your "bowlcut" looks like the undercut, its in fashion here in Germany.
666,000 views.... Illuminati confirmed

Great job, Ethan, keep up the good content.

Sent from my iPad.
REALLY?!
You prolly fucken suck!!!!
"thank you mr on the spectrum"
Funny story, so when you hold those air duster things upside down the really, really cold foam at the bottom flies out, (you can kinda see it at around 5:50 - 6:00). It's like liquid dry ice. One time I was walking around in my underwear and spilled my drink on myself. I had one of those air cans lying around and decided to directly spray that stuff onto my balls in order to dry off.  Worst decision I ever made.
I use the same mouse that you covered in cheese.
Here in my garage, just bought this new Lamborghini here. It’s fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It’s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, “the more you learn, the more you earn.”
Now maybe you’ve seen my TEDx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day. You know, I read a book a day not to show off it’s again about the knowledge. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven dollars in my bank account. I didn’t have a college degree, I had no opportunities.
But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a mentor. And another mentor. And a few more mentors. I found five mentors. And they showed me what they did to become multimillionaires. Again, it’s not just about money, it’s about the good life; health, wealth, love and happiness. And so I record a little video, it’s actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it’ll take you to my website where I share three things that they taught me. Three things that you can implement today no matter where you are.
Now, this isn’t a “get rich quick” scheme. You know, like they say if things sound too good to be true they are too good to be true. I’m not promising you that tomorrow you’re gonna be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps. So, I record a little two minute video on my website. Like I said, now it’s not the most professional I just shot it here with my iPhone, but it’s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I’m going to give you the three most important things you can do today. So click the link, go there it’s completely free to watch it it’s just a couple minutes. Invest in yourself. Always be curious. Don’t be a cynic. Okay, people see videos like this and they say “Ah that’s not real that’s for somebody else.”
Don’t listen, don’t listen. Be an optimist. Like, Conrad Hilton, the man who started Hilton Hotel, he said that he was only fifteen years old when he read a book by Helen Keller, and that book changed his life. Books can change your life. And in that book, Helen Keller said “optimism” so if you’re a cynic, if you’re a pessimist you don’t need to click here. Don’t worry about it, I don’t need to talk to everybody. But if you’re somebody who knows that there’s something better, cause the dream is possible, you know, for some of you watching it’s not necessarily a Lamborghini, maybe it’s a new job, a new opportunity, starting your own company.
Maybe it’s a new lifestyle without so much stress, traveling the world, doing those things you know you’re destined to do. You can do those unless you understand finances. Money, I don’t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I’ll see you on my website, it’s a quick video and you’ll see there absolutely free.
So just click this video and you’ll be taken there in a second, and uh, I’m excited to share this amazing stuff. You’ll see, not because of anything of me but because I’ve been fortunate enough to learn from mentors many years ahead of me. Not just in books like these, although I love books but also real in-person mentors. So let me share with you these three tips that have made all the difference in my life. They’re practical, you can do them today, you can start on them today. All right? See you there on my site.
Please post a step-by-step tutorial on becoming a true Gaming Assassin.
thanks mister on the scrotum
can't stop watching or laughing
lol navi
Why is he calling people game assassins?

Ethan is fighting in a war against himself, inside his head.
I take off all my key caps, use a vacuum cleaner to get all the bits of crumbs and dust out and then I just wipe the keyboard and key caps with a window cleaner like windex.
I felt like you Ethan. Needing to squint in order to watch his video..... the draggggg is real.
Ethan and his hipster haircut.

I swear that guy is Sheldon Cooper in real life.

lol I feel kinda bad for laughing at this one. The guy doesn't seem so bad... could shed a little of that squeaky clean. Tough sell, awkward script. Probably did the best he could with it.
My gawd, he's a Na'Vi fan boy...
I actually kinda think the broccoli cut looks pretty good.
Hey Ethan I was confused what spectrum? The autism or color spectrum

he looks like the weeknd
His eyes are so creepy! Also i can't believe you didn't say anything to part when he goes to pick up the mouse, and he just move his hand and don't pick it up.
yila is hot in the weirdest way
i got aids and cancer combined from this....
REALLY?
Really really really really holy shit that was disgusting Ethan your videos are fucking funny
rly
I feel like this isn't the last time we'll be seeing this guy. Someone who could provide so many cringes per second isn't going to just make one terrible video and call it a career.
you should make a .exe of this
the messy keyboard is like the one in Still Life Beta Male (Oneohtrix Point Never & Jon Rafman). Good job on recreating that.
4:00 that actually looks cool
No
CAN'T WAIT for REALLY.exe
This is a real reaction video, not some Jinx-shit
EYY REMEMBA MEE FUCKING IDJETS? HAHAHAHAHAHA AND THERE IT IS! IM HERE ALL WEEK 9SHITTERS.
Gamer gunk cleaner ginger
8:16 Jesus the cringe is so real LOL this faggot never played one game in his life
I hope this dude sees this video and feels humiliated
The autism ... geez
I went from 2k to 4k in dota with the gamer glasses and water
There's a new dank meme in every video. How the fuck am I supposed to keep up with this.
Whats with the nicknames for gamers i feel as if he is trying a little bit too hard
Dude I just saw your warm it up vid on Facebook and they PURPOSELY cut out your watermark
Looking like Rami Malek there hahahaha
Do a video over "train to look good naked" it would be so fucking great
I'm sorry I never subscribed to you earlier.
SMALL LOAN OF 1 MILLION DOLLARS $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
Every h3h3 reaction video i have to bring a bowl just in-case i throw up because i am dying of laughter.
Made me crack up with that broccoli haircut, hilarious! :D
That broccoli cut actually isn't bad from the side
I was crying at the bowl cut.
5:56 i do love me some gamer gunk cleaner ginger
Anyone else try and pause the video to see what Ethan's Steam name was?
just the best. you guys have the funniest videos on YouTube.
Does anyone else think the motherfucker in the Dust Off video looks like that one guy from NSYNC? Is THAT what he did after the group broke up? Talking about splooge in keyboards and dressing up like a woman?
is h3h3 howtobasic?
Fuck it. I'm subscribing <3
lmao they probably found that guy behind some gay bar blowing hobos for meth
6:23 Dammit big daddy woo woo
Man, you are like a white version of Aziz Ansari. You look just alike.
I kinda like Ethan's broccoli cut 😕
why does he look like a giraffe in a human shaped suit
broccoli  X"D
"Just fuck my shit up"
I love this channel
HOLY SHIT
HE REALLY BOUGHT ONE
Is that the flash?
Shit, Ethan. You just went full on Filthy Frank on that keyboard, b0ss.
I got that Logitech K120 as well, its cheap as shit but it works just fine for games.
Oh i hate cringing
can I plez watch agen?
Really?
"just fuck my shit up fam"
oh h3h3 you are truly on with the memes
They cut off my game assassin hair. "It's just a prank bro" they said.
this nigga looks like the weeknd with that broccoli cut lmao
That fucking keyboard. Rip in doritos gunk.
Rip keyboard and mouse. But that what u have to do to be a gaming
Holy crap i have never cringed so hard in my life. The cringe meter is at quantum levels
Couldn't even look at y'alls keyboard. Made me nasueououououssss.
Really?!?








REALLY?!?!
man h3h3 blew the fuck up, well i'm glad the dude's the ultimate goofster
pause 4:29
React to KSI Keep up
9:58 ETHAN YOU SELLOUT
This is gold. That extended clip of you spraying your keyboard had me laughing really hard.
Ethan, I hope you don't play that shit in CS:GO all the time.
Quentin Tarantino's retarded son
I like seeing all my favorite youtubers in the comments. It makes me happy.
Gamers hate him, this ugly son of a bitch is cleaning gunky gear with one simple trick and basically, you're fucking dumb. Click here to watch a free video
At least you achieved a top-notch hair doo by watching his cheeseyy gaming cleaning video.
Do a video on kids that do "let's plays" while screaming at the mic and playing overrated games that have been milked.  One example is a channel called "Glitch'e Gaming".
the gamer gear guy looks like fucken Ross lol
Was he wiping down a mac screen? I thought this was a cleaner for gaming gear.
That's how I clean my gringer grouder gramer grear
Hey Ethan, you should do a video on McJuggerNuggets. You know, the guy that keeps getting all his stuff smashed by his father, filming it and uploading it on Youtube.
You guys should do a video about the clock kid who got arrested and hoaxed/goofed the country and Obama, whom he hung out with at the White house...Oh yeah, and his sister made fake bomb threats prior to that incident. That's a real pranker, gaffs run in their blood.
I don't understand. What's up with the black girl in the beginning? Who even  is that?
I think Ethan needs a small loan of one million dollars so he can get proper bowl cut and become the game assassin he's always dreamed of being. Love you Ethan, great job, keep it up,  proud of you. God bless you with many sodie pops.
I'm the real gamer
hey H3H3 go check out this video to John Sakars and look for a comment by me and john actually replied and some other people.......Ha   its called                 soothing sounds John Sakars
FUCK! I tought I would never laugh this hard again in my life...Thank you Ethan! Oh bye the way, GREAT MOVES I am really proud of your person.
Hello there dudettes! ;)
666
Ethan got a hair dress by Vidal Sassoon. It costs US$1000, and it's called "a rat took a dump at the back of your head"
Whens the gaming fap gloves coming out?
the way he says "losing to noobs, everyday" seemed so authentic at the beginning
Proud of you
Honestly I've never heard of you before buttttt you're hella funny:))) subscribed !
lol holy shit dude, spraying a ton of canned air like that is dangerous. The fumes from all that frozen stuff coming out when you turn the can upside down can cause brain damage.
Hello Ethan. Consider doing a gaming show?

4:51 I have the same keyboard and mouse... lol!!!
REALLY edit
How is that man even possible
I have been on youtube a VERY long time now(you...can probably see that from the name). I have seen so many videos, and while I still find videos funny...I haven't ACTUALLY laughed at a video in...I honestly don't know how long. 
h3h3...thank you SO MUCH for changing that. I seriously just laughed until it hurt. 5:30
Am I the only person who thought that girl in the intro was saying, "Wow, Ethan. Great moobs. Keep it up, proud of you."?
9:47 I have aspergers and I take offense to that snide remark, Ethan. Any sensitive person would know we always wear white Sonic gloves and a Thomas the Tank Engine neckerchief with our yellow-raincoat and hardhat.
Gamer Gear.exe
after  my fifteenth watch I realized that kid looks JUST like the dad from The Brady Bunch!!!
JUST
Etan Is BaE
I'm surprised you've never done a reaction on RichKidsTV.
"Thanks, Mr. On The Spectrum"

▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ஜ۩۞۩ஜ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
yes
THIS IS PERFECT
My life will never be the same, your sacrifice means the world to me.
proper way to clean:
1) keyboard:  1-2 times a year, blow it out, then remove keys and clean with q-tips/kleenex and rubbing alcohol.  once every 2-3 years, fully immerse in rubbing/isopropyl alcohol and swish it around for a minute.  hang it up on its side shaking to get all of it out.  let dry for 5-10 mins.
2) mouse/trackball: more q-tips and rubbing/isopropyl alcohol on the ball, and also on the internal rollers if its a ball mouse, otherwise blow out near sensor for opticals and use Kleenex for surface wiping whenever you see hand oil buildup.
3) case internals:  at least once a month blow it out, focusing on any fans or heat sinks.  if you are dedicated, you can also use the rubbing/isopropyl alcohol bath used for keyboard on the internals, but be aware you will have to re-apply any thermal grease you used.  always make sure to give them a 5-10 minute dry-out period.
4) Case:  when you go to one of those manual car washes with the sprayers, just spray out the inside of the case with all components removed and use extra rinse to ensure no soap residue is left.
5) monitor:  Kleenex with rubbing/isopropyl alcohol wipe down the screen, then use a clean Kleenex to wipe off any alcohol residue.
rubbing/isopropyl alcohol is a residue free drying agent so it wont leave anything behind, will break down most biological material, and wont take very long to evaporate.  very safe for electronics as long as they aren't plugged in.
Kinda looks like the weeknd...
they are on their way to a million subs some of the best content on YouTube on this channel
3:06 JUST FUCK ME UP, FAM.
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OMGGGGGGGGG
To be fair Faker has a broccoli cut as well.

... i legit thought Hila was a really skinny guy
"This is semen removal."
~ Vinesauce Joel
Lmao
9:35 That Engineer is a Spy!
Who uses discs?
that video is so fucking cringe holy fuck fuck this shit damnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
TBH the guy does pull off the drag pretty nicely. Very tasteful makeup, and good choice of colors to compliment his skin tone.
Why didn't you contribute to papa frankus hair cake?
At 10:21 he reminds me of Kramer from Seinfeld
oh god this isn't moderately funny can we get creative and not recycle this mlg shit
That sales guy remind me of citizen z from z nation
i hate him
Broccoli Assassin for life!!
So thats what people do when they are afk on csgo haha
This channel is going to reach 1 million soon😆
Really.

Love your videos ethan, can i get a reply :D okay i sound dumb but on a serious note, you have your editing game on point!
"cyberpower PC" Haha
Long live the BroccoliAssassin
watching him ruin that keyboard was painful........
You need to make a reaction video to Coby Persin's new video haha. It's another one of these shitty experiments that has no actual purpose but to make you share it on Facebook and would not affect society in any way, just like his other experiments lol
i was wondering wtf i was watching then that "really"skit fukin killed me
hahha sick hair cut mate
we need adrian gee exposed reaction ASAP!
Holy shit, that's my monitor, or another model xD
I remember watching h3h3 at 20k subs. Now she's getting so much attention and I think he might get overrated. Don't get me wrong I want him to earn more money he deserves it a great man but the day kids say gaffs he says I'll most likely cry
4:56 is that a Zowie AM
how could you ever do that
ive probably watched this video for a total of 2 hours so far
thats almost a really good looking fade haircut lol
I like when ethan praises gamer gear for cleaning the shit off his keyboard the camera zooms in on the only clean letters J and K
honestly ethan, I can tell that the broccoli cut is going to help you tear up newbs, REALLY!
Beautiful Bowl Cut.
you're an awesome guy but seriously dude, that intro is still very cringe worthy.
Do they sell gamer rope, so I can hang my gamer neck.
two words any Australian would understand. Chris Lilley
What a goofy thumbnail
REALLY?!
This was the best video by far xD Had me rolling
The video is from 2010 so there's a pretty high chance that dude would be blowing dudes for heroin by now.
i hate you & you are annoying.
ur really n00b on CsGo maybe silver? gold 1??
Imagine Ethan reacting to cool cat lmfao
really?
i died of the cringe
WHO ELSE SEES NAVI STICKERS ON THE GLASSES, UKRAINE 👌🏼
This has always been my dirty secret to getting diamond camos faster.
His mom is such a milf.
Sorry...I just can;t watch this video, the part where he goes "Kill them all pew pewpew" just made me cringe to the point that my eyes can't even open now.
Honestly best one yet, i fucking love you h3h3.
this is how you do a reaction video RIGHT! add commentary, put it effort, make jokes, in an era where people  getting paid to just sit infront of a webcam and make funny faces passes as entertainment, your showing them how its done. the fine brothers and all of the other bland, personality-less channels out there need to take some serious notes!
i love his new hair do.
wow, ethan. Turn...





...t
All that giggling was probably coming from that back of that dude's Ford Molesto Minivan.
Holly shit Ethan you went ham on this one.
REALLY!?
4:53 when you want to be in filthy franks vomit cake video so bad
damn dude ur getting more views than subscribers that's rly Gr8 ♡♡
this guy successfully convinced me to stop playing video games and kill myself
At least he'll be gone with his virginity
8:16 it was at this moment the cringe became far too strong and i imploded on the spot.
The bowl cut came out better than I expected.
"I GOTTA SQUINT TO LOOK AT THIS SHIT MAN " LMAAOOOO
I'm a game assassin as well. I just noticed we both have the same desk chair. We should both be planet rangers together.

Fuck you Ethan!
10:02 That surround sound terrified me.
dude tai lopez has a new ad out, its a house tour, please do a reaction vid
4:51 Bodily fluids will not make me cringe, gore will not make me wretch, but people making a mess on their computer equipment makes me feel thoroughly disgusted to my core.
Hila body-pillow when?
Mm rank?
If that "Broccoli Top" was a bit more styled and shaped, it would honestly look really good on you dude. Just sayin'... It's very modern and stylish.
"And thats how you use Gamer Gunk cleaner Gingger, to clean your Gamer Gunk"

Spot on advertising Ethan! Keep it up! I'm proud of you!

Lel. Casual's hair got rekt.

#MLG #noscope #420 #blazeit #WhatMLKStoodFor
I have that same fucking keyboard
Gaming eye specs are a legit thing though. Some people experience straining when they play video games, so they were specific glasses to help their eyes not hurt when they play video games
the fuck did i just misclick into
Wow, Ethan used to be so thin.
lmfao at the cloning part i thought you had edited that in until you paused the video..... holy shit
Do one on Kaitlin Jenner
Why does this channel not have millions of subs..?
please don't be a real thing, please.
He's taken the naked bit out of the intro :P
rip Ethans hair
react to licking guy
most gamer labeled products are just total overpriced garbage. hint hint hint.
you leaned so far back in that chair lmao I thought you were going to fly off (when he's in drag reaction)
Funniest video you've ever done, imo. You are a god.
LMFAO
Of all the videos you have ever reacted to, I think this is a contender for the most cringeworthy. R-R-R-R-REALLY?
Ur mate is ugly. U deserve better men,H3h3
Whats up my dudettes
Lol the Navi sticker
I feel sorry for the guy acting, I hope he got paid well
2/10 no slpooge. Try again Ethan.
Ethan you are one line of defense against all of these prankers and vloggers. We rely on you to seek out and destroy the infestations. Thank You xo
Ur how 2 basic u fucking monkey, I love u dad
7:40 kinda looks like Robert De Niro hahaha
Ethan check ksi's new video you're in it
You were in KSI's video about the illuminati!
fuck i died at this one
"Thanks, Mr. On the Spectrum" is now my go-to sarcastic response to everything
Ethan looking like The Weeknd's cousin, The Weekdy with that haircut!
I have stitches in my mouth right now and "Thanks Mr On-The-Spectrum" actually brought me physical pain from laughing. Fkin Ethan.
Do a reaction video to Vanoss Gaming, I can't stand their fucking cringe-worthy videos. Unfunny and dry gaming humor made by 19 year olds for 10 year olds.
This guy looks like a school shooter https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xFF9h77kJPwIy4/giphy.gif
the aspergers is real
congrats on the ksi shoutout
I made a gif to this video: https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xFF9h77kJPwIy4/giphy.gif
Navi fan?
Ethan watch the newest video of KSI! You are in it! TRIGGERED!
The most savage takedown of a known faglord of all time. This Xtreme gamer gear dork needed to be slaughtered and you delivered. Unreal savagery. Very satisfactory. Back to cleanin my gamer gear anyway,
Am I the only one wanting to know what the Victory Lane is?
Even Ethan uses an auto in deathmatch
Can someone link me to this video?
That air spray part killed me hahahaha; this may be my favorite yet! That "Mr. On-The-Spectrum" comment really sealed the deal for me I think.
You need to do one on pro gamers being called  Athletes lol it's pathetic
the haircut looks soooo good 4 real dude
How's that diamond water going anyways? Have you bought any yet?
This video gave me a nosebleed..
Csgo rank?
Saw you on KSI latest video on 2:56

Dude, try playing the organ.  You got the wrong cut.  You got the Cameron Carpenter touring organ cut.
That video was uploaded five years ago; I wonder what he's up to these days...
I see Ethan learned a thing or two from Filthy Frank
Re-re-re-re-REALLY!
Lmao THIS WAS IN A CRINGE COMPILATION.
I play Xbox.
How do you clean semen out of a keyboard?
I think there is already something to make you a better gamer, it's called adderall...
oh god the cringe
oh god the cringe
maybe hes on speed or maybe he has ADHD
shouldve done comp instead of deathmatch
I smell new exe file coming. <3
People still play this game?
10:13 who else thought that there was actually someone crying
Na'Vi fangay
pusi destroyer
5:10 I am officially having a bad time.
I would so play CS:GO with Ethan
This needs a cringe warning. I now have cancer cause of this guy.
Faker is actually called the "broccoli assassin" or something like that, because he plays assassins champs and had a broccoli haircut at LoL worlds
That dude/dudette has a neck and a knowledge of video games that reminds me of the "Copy That" guy.
Jesus Christ your haircut HAHAHAHA
I sexually identify as a Dude-ett. Don't misgender me cis scum.
The laughing at 10:02 scared the shit out of me because I was convinced something was behind me O_O
Good job Ethan keep it up- Michelle Obama
I know you won't read this,but I absolutely love your videos and they always make my whole week easier.I could watch them all 24/7 and not get bored , you're the best comedian on the internet hands down .

starving children in Africa could have eaten that keyboard
Tell us your SteamID Ethan!

Can you please play DLC Simulator for android/iOS? pls
The Broccoli looks actually cool, can't wait for it to catch on
i see a demon @ 8:53

Anyway, any chances of doing reactions to shitty movies?
great moves Ethan.
I have just paid my bills and now I have a due dept? Fuck.
hahaha "mr. on the spectrum"
How did Ethan not gag when he was cleaning the keyboard?! Unless... HE'S A TRUE GAMER? THE TIPS WORKED?!
The "Broccoli Cut" looks like the guy from "The Weeknd"'s haircut.
HowToBasic invades H3H3 productions!
spam 1

If aziz ansari and michael swim had a love child...

dank as fuck
One of the best vids so far! Great moves!
You're out of touch...
I'm out of time...
But I'm out of my head when you're not around.
So, am I the only one who thought Ethan looked good with the broccoli cut?
What a waste african children could've eaten that hair.
The cringe King
please please please do a video on 'black jokes in the hood (gone wrong )'.
This is so cringeworthy I shriveled up and inverted myself.
rip that keyboard.
Is Sean majorleaguewobs?
The intro makes me moist
Holy shit this video had me crying, thank you Ethan
Has anyone else noticed that the h3h3 comment section is always filled with comments from larger channels? It's awesome! Everyone loves these videos!
His eyes are a little too far apart.
holy shit there's like 4 videos like this on the dustoff channel, you have to do them
How the hell did you not cough after emptying an entire can of that spray?
how do you find these ridiculous videos jesus christ
help i just put too much lettuce in my mouth

I'm taking this cunt off of YouTube. Sorry teens.

The one thing I love about this channel is that it gets more views than the amount of subscribers it has.
damn that really joke is almost as good as another one
You are one disgusting person that's for dayum sure
Oh man, Ethan is such a pussy repellant that even his WIFE won't sleep with him. Poor guy.
This video reminded me that I had to clean the neckbeard crumbs out of my keyboard. Thanks man.

Dude that broccoli haircut actually looked pretty cool. Btw I am new to your channel and I'm already a big fan. I wish u didn't have to support that company by buying one of their duster cans just to show it is not worth the money. I love how you are the only big youtuber that isn't afraid to call out those big ass fake ass pranksters that stage every prank yet the sheep still watch them and thumbs them up. Although a lot of them are bots.
lol guys I was the guy who killed Ethan in cs. I remember his name lol, add him, his name is "Assgoblin" np lol
I hope that keyboard was dead tbh
I haven't laughed on YouTube in months . God bless finding this channel a week ago
another day another meme
Unsubbed, Ethan has a shitty prebuilt PC.
Love you
just fuck me up fam
Nearly died laughing already at 0:21
Wait. Was the Michel Obama?
None of this shit was in the source video WHAT THE FUCK ETHAN? ARE YOU OUTTA YOUR MOIND?

EDIT: Gamergunk is fucking cum. I jizzed on my keyboard and Dustoff cleaned all the spooge right off! Thanks Ethan!
"Thanks, mr. on the spectrum!"
8:16     The cringe has never been so painful
Lolol "wtf is this isn't a bowl cut! This is a broccoli cut!" The best h3h3 video lol
What is this channel?
I had a stroke watching this.
god bless TriHard HaHa lmao
give me your Dota glasses
I clicked the video just because of the giraffe neck guy.
I'm only half way through the video but I have to say. The dirt and shit on/in my gear is what makes me able to own bitches in any game.
LOL his name is CS GO i think it was GoDaddyWooHoo
Hair actually looked good lol.
i was already dying of laughter at the thumbnail
I can barely watch this due to how cringe worthy the ad is
You look a bit like The Weeknd with the haircut
still wondering why you didn't put in the part where he talks about his hardware crashing and burning with the shitty fire overlay and him going 'OH NO!' That was a cringe gem.
I knew what this was going to be because I saw it on Vinesauce. 

was not disappointed
shall mlg be with you
holy hell, this was great!
We're all dudes now!
this is very tim and eric like
A CD won't clean shit m8

Your gear will burn in hell along with you misogynistic pigs
I struck YouTube gold finding you guys! I love your channel and Hila's art. ☺️

Those gaming gear glasses do look kinda cool
Came here like Wtf? Left satisfied tbh
Yo ethans a pro gamer with that steel series mousepad bro

maybe their plan WAS to become a meme...
so gamers buy it as a joke.
someone please make a gif of him getting the nachos and shit on his keyboard

classic
Ayy I got the same monitor
Ethan, ill have you know that to become a game assassin, you don't need a bowl-cut, you need aderrol.
fuck me up, fam.
What are you going to do with all that extra hair, Make a cake?
Kenny Vs. Spenny anyone?
fuck xD
And that's how a broccoli assassin cleans his keywords with his gamer cleaner ginker.
Yo, ethan's hair is on point..!
Where does Ethan find all these 90's style clothing
\
This is a different reaction, but I swear you already did this video.
that broccoli haircut is AWESOME!
REALLY!
wow ethan great intro. You should make more non-review videos.
No comments to display
haha YES... i can't wait to start seeing more "really"'s and "are ya outta ya mind"s and "wow" winks in h3h3 vids.
This goes straight to my favourites.
I have the same keyboard @ 4:47. ily ethan
SHIT IAN FOUND ME
XD dude I laughed real hard on the intro... Great job, keep it up =)
I think this is the cringiest video you've reacted to Ethan. To quote one of your previous reactions: "watching this guy is like I have a sour candy in my mouth"
how do you put the cd in if the computer is O-F-F?
your videos are neat but I heard you're Jewish so I can't watch this anymore bye.
Rly?
comic sans warning
Oh god now everyone's gonna start spamming "R-R-R-RE-RE-RE-RE-RE-REALLLLLYYYYY" in the Youtube comment section xddddddddddd
I prefer Joels reaction.
DENDI IS BAE!!!  Rip old d2 navi...
gamer gunk cleaner ginger
"Ok so how do i do it?"

"Just fuck me up fam"
And that's how you use "Gamer Gunk: Cleaner Geenger: To clean your Gamer Gunk"

Fucking lost it
You should consider doing stand up comedy, your videos are fucking hilarious
Detroit vs Everybody ;)
Gamer Dude has a square head like Frankenberry.
This video is so well done I really would not like it if we're a steak
Joel said that this guy snorted a line before doing this "advertisement". I stand by that till the end of every universe and timeline ever.
are you a game assassin, dude? you're probably fucking siiiiick
This was hilarious you earned a sub
Lmao, his eyes are too fucking far apart.
I hope everyone as some Top 10 reasons why your day was amazing.
Was it really worth it
this guy looks like a crack head version of drake from drake and josh im not talking about h3 its the guy that this video is about
10:02 I SHAT MY FUCKING PANTS

Dudette is wrong to say, but calling Hila a dude is alright. lol

Mom would be so proud you spent a shit load of money on this crap.
This is one of my favorite videos by far! Keep it up!!
Dude has a long ass neck.
REACT TO RICEMAN
Get out your gaming cleaner kit to clean off your screen. wipes a mac screen
You actually look really good with frames, dude.
A good cup of kicking your ass
Can someone photoshop Ethan's bowl cut on a brocolli and make Brock Lee hold it?
Can you react to Anna Akana's "How Not to get Raped"
Your videos are the equivalent to your wife saying you've got a bigger dick than your brothers. It's good, but also horrible. I can't believe I sit through this cringe just to hear you make fun of them. Anyways, cheers!
Please do foseytube next.
Rip headphone users
outstanding video ethan, great moves, keep it up
Holy shit Ethan is that a membrane keyboard? Only fucktard faggot fucks use membrane keyboards. fuck you i hope you have a shitty christmas
I love how you just splooged cheese sauce all over your free Azza keyboard from cyberpower, at least it was good for something
Noice
O-F-F-F-F-F-F
I swear that I saw one of the Vinesauce people show this (Joel, Vinny, or Rev)
I didn't think my dick could cringe so bad that it recedes into me so far you can see it at the back of my throat.
h3h3 whats ur rank
I wish I had a Hila of my very own. . . someone to bowl cut me, close up on my nacho cheese chips... fml.
The giggling fucked my shit so hard
Funny video, but as someone with asperger's, I did find the "on the spectrum" joke to be a little upsetting.

Still love you though, man
Awesome new video, guys!!
This is one of those guys where u just think...end your life now.
He acts like the guy in The Flash.
i'm watching a grown mat spray compressed air at cheese on a keyboard. 

someone please kill me.
Is this a Tim and Eric sketch? its gotta be, right?  ..right?
I would be really happy if you made a really.exe Ethan.
6:10 using an auto. what a noob! XD lel
TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH ETHAN
4:50 - I cried D;
Funniest video by far. One of the most underrated channels on youtube. Can i buy one of those dunnies that hila makes?
That guy doesn't look or talk like a human. I'm convinced he's an extra terrestrial.
fuckin love this youtube channel. id love to converse with you Ethan
haro mr h3h333333333 pls react to percy inglis xd
I cringed when u put the dip on the keyboard [triggered]
Talk about Wranglerstar.
It's good that he cloned himself... that way he can go fuck himself.
comic sans warning ahahahahahha
I would actually buy the screen cleaner, because I'd assume it's formulated to clean a screen better than water, without stripping the anti-glare coating like a lot of household window cleaners do.
worth every dime
Really.exe plez
this video gave me cancer
h3h3 is my new favorite channel
really
RIP Navi
EXCUSE ME it didn't work for your keyboard because you didn't hold it like an ACCORDION

mr. gamer assassin looks like sid from ice age tbh
Big dick Ethan

Out of all the goofy gaafs you have reacted to this, Ethan, this one was the hardest for me to watch.

Ugly dude

6:22 LETS ALL RAID BIGDADYWOOWOO ON STEAM
You can tell that the gamer is skinny, mental, weak, and probably gets bullied at school.
Ethan sounds like NobodyEpic
i could have used that keyboard
dude is an androgynous term... At least it was in California.
So good

5:02  Bad time warning.

Ethan, you've already shaped your hair into the proper shape, now you just have to apply the proper hair dye and buy some vintage glasses so you can do a video about feminism. I would recommend anti-patriarchy pink for your first dye job.
BROCCOLI ASSASSIN LMFAOOAISDUIASGDAYScfuafsc

anything4views
Your hair would've looked nice if the bangs weren't cut off
CRINGE
JUST...
Really!
I am now imbued with the power of a million gamers
So happy to be clean....
FUCKING CRINGE
I feel so bad making fun of that guy, yeah it's a little cringy and cheesy but he could sell anything to anyone. He just looks like that kind of guy who is all cheerful and positive in public and in work but when no one's around it's like he's depressed and suicidal and that hits home.
Is that Ross from Game Grumps?
MLG air canister, only for real gamers. Buy it now for 99.99$ and get a free 5 litre bottle of Mtn Dew and a lifetime supply of Doritos

dangerously cheesy.
Top quality when you shave your head just to make fun of a guys hair cut.
Looks like I'm picking my dream of becoming a professional DotA player back up... I should've known I was only losing cause of the gaming residue in my keyboard.

Waiting for you to cover this video, amazing stuff as always!
WOW YOU GUYS EXPLODED

4:51 made me scream, I haven't stopped screaming since...why Ethan?

Why the fuck did you buy the product tho?
This gamer is beyond mortal understanding. He has acquired so much insight that he has ascended.

I nearly choked on my rice at the "game assassins" part of the video. Eating and watching a new reaction video don't mix very well.
omg
by gamers, 4 gamers.
What's your steam user name?
Spit out my coffee when the haircut was revealed! AHAHA Amazing. Proud Of You.

That fucking giggling actually sounded like it was coming from somewhere in my room
Haircut actually turned out decent
Ladies and Terminators holy shit this guy is a marketing genius.
Holy shit this guy is a joke.
I like you and all but your'e just too jewish
I thought I will never see this hell again when Joel showed this on his stream. There is a certain type of cringe that is hard to go through.
This is the greatest video ever
H3H3 PLS MAKE A STEAM GROUUPPP!

This almost killed me, lmao
Wow man, I had tears streaming down my cheeks when you revealed your new haircut. I say you keep it, make a phat statement to all your haters. 

Broccoli man.
That gamer gear guy is a disgrace to society. If someone makes you cringe more than 10 times in one sitting, that person needs to be put on an isolated island away from civilization and then nuked 20 times.
CLEANING GAMING GEAR PRANK [GONE WRONG] [GONE SEXUAL]

You should do a face reveal at 1k subs.
Ethan play cs go, u x1 m8 fuking noob.

The cringe is eating me from the inside out
+h3h3productions When It cut back to Ethan after she was cutting HAHAHAH LMAO

400,000 subs? Great moves Ethan and Hila, Proud of you.
I hope this actor got paid a lot of money.

:S
Damn, Ethan and Hila, your videos are the best! Usually watch 'em more than a couple of times, they always have me laughing.
I cringed so hard I got a six pack and lost all my gamer cred, Thanks gamer spray!!!!
the hair didn't turn out that bad tbh
Fake
Love the new hair
I'm so upset, my girlfriend broke up with me and I just miss the affection and love I got daily and now I feel so alone and isolated.

I had headphones on 10:02 scared the absolute fuck out of me. I was frantically scanning the room thinking wtf was that. REALLY.
joel infected the internet
low hanging fruit
Be excellent to each other, dude!
What rank are you in Counter Strike???

Watching this video is actually painful.
He looks like an autistic turtle
it's funny how you bitch at SoFlo Antonio for not giving credits to anyone's video he posts while you didn't even state the source of the dramatic music in the beginning. Oh yeah folks, it's from European War 4: Napoleon.
So good hahaha thanks Ethan and Hila
you can get the same pressurized air that works exactly the same, 3 of them for 6 dollars :')
Can you please just do a whole video reacting to buzzfeed. There's so much gold there.
Corsair SPEC-01 gang yo

Why would you do that to your beautiful keyboard?
Now "REALLY" is going to become a living meme.
Ethan got the youtube prankster haircut.
MIKAELA, REALLY?! ARE YOU CRAZY?! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MOIND?!
i can see an .exe coming for this failed version of the tf2 scout
Lol if the front was done properly, that would have actually been a decent haircut!
Watching what you did to that keyboard killed me on the inside a little.
Poor Keyboard
Ethan, what did you do with the keyboard after? Did you bother to wash it or did you just throw it in the bin?
Papa Joel and Papa Ethan must have made a pact signed in soady pahp to come up with this one
You forgot the egg :/

'Das only in the monin.
NEW VIDEO, WOOOOO!!!
Papa jorgel showed us this mighty cringe.
Really?
And I though the hitler youth hair cut good . Cauliflower power.
Fucking. broccoli assassin hahah!!!!!
Oh the things people wouldn't do for money.
8:59 pewdiepie ?
Best  one yet imo
So Ethan zooms in on the Rias Gremory joking the T force. Does this mean Ethan is a High School DxD fan?
Lol h3h3 trying to keep up with all of the other zany channels on youtube. Staying relevant in these times of Vomit-cake-eating, random-tattooing, selfharming and humiliating channels, you need to step up your game son!

Good on you with the hair, although may I suggest you try something more daring next time?

God bless,
Papa John
I'm afraid to tell you gamers, but the Dust-Off spray won't spray away your virginity.
I bet Ethan isn't even ranked, casual scrub.
There's a hair on my keyboard
"Thanks Mr on the spectrum"
I laughed way too hard at this
I forgot how cringey that video is.
How dumb do they think "gamers" are?
That's no Bowl cut, that's a coriander cut, unsubbed.

The guy reminds me of LinusTechTips
Took you long enough
Who needs compressed air cans, disk brushes, and cleaning wipes. Just shove your nutsack inside of the disk slot! Use your man fuzz to ensure royal de-dusting inside of your equipment. The best thing of all, it's free! 

Also try smacking your self in the face with a hammer until you develop a Brain Aneurysm and collapse on the floor slowly slipping away from this earth. 

Remember: the best way to save money is to not have money.

Thank you Gaming Gear Duster, I've never gotten more high with any huff in the handicap stall in the 24 hour Wal Mart bathroom.  I used to just rely on normal Dust Off, but Gaming Gear Duster really gives me that half dead rock bottom feeling I've always strived for.  Thanks Gaming Gear Duster!!!
I've never seen Ethan so committed to a bit before.

That guy does look pretty good in women's clothes. Gets the gamer gunk flowing.
Great episode!
Finally Ethan can clean his gamer gear.
Fuck this giraffe

The keyboard suffered, but I laughed every second XD
I did not know gamer gunk as a thing,But now I know.
Oh Man! Just look at all that crap flying out of there

Hey Ethan and Hila, I just found your channels two weeks ago, and I fell in love with your work so hard I tried getting my friends, family, and girlfriend to watch your videos but they all told me to go fuck myself. What am I doing wrong?
what an auto noob.
we all know the real reason we buy air duster is to turn it upside down and spray that shit at people
Pretty disappointed in this one, Ethan --has caused me to reminisce of past glories: Maregasm, Bobo, Enema-girl, Pappa John, Love your body and the like..
I'm going to be dissapointed if you don't use that REALLY in future videos. Lol
Thanks Ethan! Now I'm finally Bronze 4.

They should just have the balls to call it the Cum Blaster, since we all know 99% of gamer gunk is jizz.
Motherfucker looks like he has lizard eyes.

Fuck man, I better buy that gamer air. Can't clean my PC with it if it isn't GAMER AIR.
have never cringed more at one video
I know you here this all the time, but thank you. I had a really shitty day today and I watched this video and now I feel all better. Thank you for another amazing video, Ethan and Hila. Also, I can't decide if I should be a game assassin or a broccoli assassin like REALLY.
I knew this was going to be the next h3 reaction
Listening to this kid talk gave me a fucking headache
I was going to say three seconds into the video you need a fucking haircut you looked like a chimney sweep
I like how they don't show the guy cleaning the pc, can you imagine this idiot trying to understand a computer?
reaction video for prince ea
nothing brightens my day more than seeing h3h3 in my sub box
ARE YOU CRAZY!? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND!?
JOEL
ARE YOU DOWNLOADING BOOBS AGAIN
Bowl cut (gone sexual) 2015 Broccoli sex kissing in  the hood
Hey Dudettes. Mom would be so proud. Really! If you listen closely, It's so happy to be cleaned
Hey great stuff but I prefer my Cinco Game Boy.
4:53

I blame Papa Franku
Why did the Gamer Air turn white like wtf
Oh, I have the same keyboard as you guys! Logitech K120 =D
I was not prepared for what this video had to offer.
oh no! NO, why would you... I cant watch this!
So you wanted to be a gamer? THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET.
Did christian propaganda spill to youtube?
JOEL

MAKE LOVE TO ME J O E L
Woooooow guys you really took the reaction game to the next level
umm... your hair grew again 0.0
3:48 has a sudden urge to watch a Kid 'n Play movie
Ethan are you going gray? how old are you
I love eila she's like leah cute and funny
ffs why no boxed gamer water?
Wow, r.i.p to that innocent keyboard.
Is that keyboard ok?
im a cool game assassin
6:10 the keyboard of a dakdak user
lmfaooooo!! best yet bro!!!!!!!!
Holy shit they actually still produce that shit!?

It was really cool that you finally did a video on this g(old)y.
10/10 vid
tfw I have a k120
same as the boi ethan
I couldn't stop cringing over his keyboard
"Just fuck me up fam" hahahahaha
Thanks for making me laugh on this sad day, h3h3.
you guys are to phucin funny. OMG I love you guys XD; I'm tearing up right now. the broccoli assassin
76 people got gamer assassinated
Where do you get such cringey shit?
At the beginning of the video I was going to suggest that Ethan got a haircut but you guys really beat me to it
JOEL
hila gave ethan the weeknd lol
ethans got the same case as me
You deserve so many more subscribers for the quality and quantity of content you upload!
wtf is wrong with that guys face?
REALLY ?
Sad part is the haircut Ethan got is actually a super popular haircut these days
This channel is hitting 1 million subs by April next year and i'm calling it out
Here's to a new meme!

REALLY?
Ethan is the cause of retarded videos gaining more views.
congrats on 400,000 subs!
THANKS MR ON THE SPECTRUM BAHAHAHAHAA😂😂😂
wow, I just realized that h3h3's comment section is like one of the least cancerous comment sections on youtube, even though it's filled with cancer.
I rub my anus with the callouses on my left fingers.
I feel bad for your keyboard
Just fuck me up, fuck my shit up. I'm fucking dying laughing here. Perfect execution of a meme typically done in text.
I use that keyboard and mouse at 4:51... i will never look at it the same way after seeing what you did
"Gamer Gunk"
I can see the light reflecting off of one of your portraits.

ETHAN IS A FRAUD HACK
4:55 XD Im dead
Man, Jodi Foster's career has gone downhill.
"just f*ck me up fam"

ahaha memes on memes
grats on 400k guys!
Congratulations on 400k! Love the Videos👍🏻
The cringe is too strong.
Ethan became the weeknd with that bowl cut bruh
ethan reminds me of mac demarco
Wow Ethan great moves keep it up Mama would be so proud.
the brocoli assasssin looks like he would be black
Ethan you should make a gaming channel for csgo
Filthy Franku is that you?
You almost killed me dude, I was eating Pizza Goldfish and drinking my energy drinks when you started putting cheese dip and doritos all over your keyboard and mouse, and then the comic-sans warning happened and I inhaled a whole bag of Pizza Goldfish.
that guy didnt look half bad in drag
Fuck, I was drinking when he revealed his bowl cup. I sneezed and spat water all over my keyboard and monitor. Fucking worth it.
I smell joel
Can i have a small loan of a million dollars?
really?!
10:04 took off my earphones when those voices started. Thought they were coming from outside lol
You were way off on your fashion sense on this one Ethan, neither of those are bowl haircuts. His haircut is more like a late nineties Ellen DeGeneres, or maybe a Dana Carvey and yours isn't a bowl cut either. I don't know what that is called in Israel, but in California, Colorado, and Washington state, that is called an after a bowl cut.   To be honest, the more I look at that strip across the front, that might even qualify as an after a couple of bowls cut. Whatever it is sir... tell Hlla it was worth all eight years of beauty school tuition.
"Thanks Mr-on-the-spectrum"
your haircut actually looks like a youtube gamer's haircut
THATS SOME GOOD GAMER WRATER!!!
Ethan's hair looks like it would feel like sheep wool.
8:17 this is where I draw the line
that whole broccoli assassin hair bit has me cracking up, dude
let me catch my son doing this kinda stuff over the internets shm
Thank you, now I can game like the best
great moves ethan, keep it up!
5 hours and already 166k view!!!!!!!! woooo!!! keep this shit up guys!!!
Died at "Thanks Mr. On-The-Spectrum". Great moves, keep it up.

Signed, a person "On The Spectrum".
8:50 thank god he's god
wait, 
oh no..
I'm disappointed by the lack of Vinesauce comments.
I've been waiting for this
400,000! and rising!
I can't believe I forgot that all gamers have ADHD.
brocoli assasin ftw HAHAHA
what's your steam? I want to Cs go 1v1 you
Damn, that 1080p makes you look 5w337 son!
had 15 minutes left to do my homework and was looking for a song playlist and this showed up.... welp I guess i have 5 minutes now
Ethan, this is your best video yet. I laughed so hard I developed bronchitis and am now possibly asthmatic.
Ethan have more Grey hair then my dad
Let's give Ethan a small loan of a million gamer gear glasses
I want a pair of those na'vi glasses
Trying so hard to be "funny" can be counterproductive...
REALLY? GONE SEXUAL
I couldn't stop laughing as soon as I saw your bowl cut. Almost collapsed, holy shit!
"I'm a real gamer..."  Made me die by laughter
really.exe
Thanks Mr. on the spectrum.
Wow, Ethan, great moves.
REALLY?
no joke, those giggles were hella creepy. I thought they were coming from behind me D:
Do watch chadtronics version. He fills his computer with cat liter
This video is the best/worst thing I have seen all week. Thank you. Keep it up. Proud of you.
KILL OR BE SLAUGHTERED!!!
My body went limp and I had tears running down my eyes at 4:50
REALLY?!
ive played games since like 99 and ive legit never heard of someone saying game assassin
In all honesty, this is probably the best reaction video I have seen so far. Good job, Ethan, keep it up, and remember to keep on tipping, tucking, and learning those newbs the way of the broccoli.
6:57 is that Marlon Brando?
I have the same Logitech keyboard!
9:33 when did Bob the builder become mlg, his mom must be real proud of him.
Please do a react to react channels. I'm not saying channels like you that  edit  or plan an actual commentary. I'm talking about the fucking idiots that just stare at the screen and laugh every other minute . Those are fucking stupid as fuck and just as cancerous as gone sexual pranks or pranks in the hood
I had to take my headphones off at 10:05 holy fuck scared the shit out of me.
It's not that big a deal, but it was a little surprising to hear someone who knows to refer to autistic people as "on the spectrum" use it as an insult? Like, it really caught me off guard. I'm not sure if you intended to just throw out a punch at autistic people, but it's kinda lame to punch down randomly in an otherwise totally fine video. Take it as you will, I still like the video.
Wow, Ethan, groovy intro. Makes me happy. Keep it coming. Proud of you.
(Also, that Gamer Gear guy should be shot at least twice)
I can already smell the cancer
I had to get up and leave after I saw the doritos and dip on the KB/M, omg it hurt me too bad. I came back though. Nice vid lel.
Holy fuck this channel is growing, h3h3 army gonna hit 1/2 a mil in a month
Can you do one on Alpha Omega Sin?

Cause that guy is on the cray juice D:
Thanks Mr. On The Spectrum
The Broccoli Gamer looks like The Organ God
This is the good stuff, this is semen removal.
We need a video every day!! i fucking laugh my ASS off at these uploads fuck!!
Keep doing it dirty Ethan!
"Thanks Mr on the spectrum", Lost my shit holy moly.
Really!

Awww yeah! The perfect cap off to the weekend.
RIP NA'VI
REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY
dota boys
You definitely went all out in this video and love it.
Get a haircut
3:47 the broccoli cut actually works 1000 times better than the bowl cut https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kyjxwvDXNdY/hqdefault.jpg (best league of legends player in the world)
Am I the only one who thinks he looks like Ross O'Donovan?

"Thanks, Mister On The Spectrum"
MASSIVE KEYBOARD DAMAGE
That laugh at the end seriously freaked me out. Sounded like it was coming from another room. Nearly choked on my sodie pop!
Omg I had tears running down my eyes, Best video ever
Omg I had tears running down my eyes, Best video ever
but... hes a dude... and shes a dude... were all dudes.
I feel sad for the dude. I mean he had to say all those shitty lines and do all that acting crap just to get some money. They probably didn't even pay him much :/
Your bowl cut looks like the haircut most of the kids use these days, cool
that awkward moment when Ethan has the same keyboard as you
I feel like fucking stabbing someone.
That guy is so fuckin' cringeworthyingly (Jesus, #longmeaninglesswords) fuckin' ugly and annoying.
I honestly don't know how you survive these people without dying of cringe, Ethan, I honestly don't.
Keep up the good work. :D
Thanks doc.
does anyone else watch these videos high off their ass? it's pretty great
That poor keyboard. Lucky you bought that real gamer assassin gear to clean it. Papa johns appreciates ya.
JUST FUCK MY SHIT UP FAM
I love how you and Jontron mercilessly obliterate your hardware.
lol, Chadtronic made a reaction to this as well.
That giggling fucking scared the shit out of me. I was using headphones the whole time. BIG MISTAKE JFC
10:00 gamergear.exe

congrats on 400k bro!
I love this. I love you.
Natus Vincere is a crap team sorry bb. Ur gamer glasses wont work good.
This is for sure a top 3 cringe all time. I had to pause the video halfway through because I felt sick from looking at the master gamer assassin.
The voices/slash giggling at 10:05 spooked me.
almost managed to make your hair that current style everyone has
Is Hila his wife? She's fucking smoking.
Joel did it first
He's playing CS:GO :O

Rest In Papa that keyboard is now getting big tips in the sky.
Fuck, I've bought this stuff before. Only once but still. What do I do now?
Looks like someone threw a Vulcan, a Hobbit, and Jim Breuer in a blender and this guy was the sad result.
just fuck me up fam
anyone else catch how he used an ibuypower keyboard to get all the gamer gunk on? haha
I love Ethan's little giggle at 5:49
glad im not the only one who drinks water like that
3:40 Holy fuck, man. I fucking lost it XD
Really? Are you crazy? Are you outta your mind?! REALLY?!
Since when the fuck was mortal kombat a shoot em up?
I thought the kid said 'and kill all those nasty Germans'...
I don't know if that says something about me, or the video, but it's fucked up regardless.
Congrats on 400K Ethan. Keep it up. Proud of you.
On a side note, this was easily one of the top ten cringiest videos on your channel. Gotta be.
But I already saw Uncle Joguel react to this.
6:09 stop using a fucking autosniper
Gunk Off Dust Off Duster Air Dust REALLY!?
best one yet!
That's like $150 in peripherals, lost in the queso
You need to make a gamergear.exe, please.
YA CAN'T DO IT DIRTY! YA GOTTA DO IT CLEAN!!
Rias Gremory killed you in cs
The cringe is real
Hisssssss
That haircut make's you look like the Jewish version of the Weeknd
You know h3h3 is a good youtuber, more then 1/4 of this subs have already watched this video THE DAY IT CAME OUT, pewdiepie gets like 1/8 of his total subs after a couple of days.
Wow,  oh jeez,  I never knew I was lazy,  a slob and an idiot.  Thanks Mr. Safety.
Yeah, turn your gamer gear spray can upside down to get your gear fucking high!

Gaming gear? ARE YOU CRAZY?! ARE U OUTTA YA MOYND?!
Please, do an h3h3 reaction video to the Adrian Gee cluster fuck. I am dying of ass cancer and only have 2 weeks to live. It is my dying wish to see an Adrian Gee reaction video... please do it, h3h3... do it for my ass.
Just found out about H3H3 a few days ago. Best channel I've came across lmfao!
What was the point of the dorito and cheese part now? Why is every channel going the way of HowToBasic? Fucking bullshit. Ethan talking about cringe and reee? What the hell? Why is everyone doing all this try hard 4chan bullshit nowadays?
oh ethan i love you! i always hoped you made a video on this joker, you made my day thanks man!
Today was one of the worst days I've had in a while, but I couldn't help myself when Ethan went at his keyboard with the Gamer Air, I almost fell to my knees laughing! Thanks for the videos guys, and keep it up!
Holy fuck your broccoli haircut made me wet
I really wish gamer glasses were just something you made up for comedic effect.
I smell a new meme
O F F F F F F OFF....
I fucking love gamer water just blasting scrubs in battlefront taking clean sips
fuck ethan. put up a trigger warning before u blast that shit comic sans in my face.

You look like  Kid n' Play with that cut, this was so amazing you deserve a small loan of a million dollars. $$$
hey i have that keyboard
This guy swims in pussy
How hard does one game? not as hard as Ethan in the beginning
Ethan, you missed the homoerotic gamer dudes at the end, "I'm the man" "no I'm the man" 

I expect a part 2
Will Gamer Gear help me clean my Gamer Gate?  It's really filthy, almost like it Tumbld.
At the end of this video i wanted to throw my shit at his face
Broccoli Assassin killed me
Rubbing alcohol, Q-Tips, Any can air, Windex and some paper towels. That's all you need.
And most of that you don't.

This is just house hold products, rebranded and increased in price.
Oh and slapped with a logo made by an eleven-teen year old kid with MS Paint.
REALLY
Broccoli cut on point
ster did it first
400K - BO'S IN THE HOUSE!

It's so weird, you can tell that the guy is British but they have him doing an accent.
"Just fuck me fam." DEAD
i watched this regular vid on dex's cringefactor
Congrats on 400k you sexy man ;)
Thanks Mr.Satan.
Holy shit. The subreddit is going to be exploding Mt. Dew and Doritos dust after this.
Ethan is proof that the Jews control everything even the memes
Ah man I really just need a $mall loan of a million dollars for that sweet cleaning gear $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ eks dee
"Just fuck me up fam" Yes please
really
You are honestly the best youtuber :') hahahaha
Oh shit man, you hit 400k subs, congrats!

Ethan plays CSGO. You are now even greater.
You are literally Aziz Ansari.
Ethan coughing on my PC would maker it clearer than using dust off
Bless you papa franku
Dear god i was not prepared for these levels of cringe, i think i coughed up blood oh man.
Wow really Ethan really great really moves,keep really it really up. Proud really of really you
"Thank you Mr. On The spectrum." Fucking savage. I could feel the burn from here.
Damn, this video fucked you up uncle Ethan
You can tell he's struggling not to laugh at 4:02
congrats on 400k subs!
That thumbnail cracks me up. It's amazing.
All that cheese and dorito's wasted m8.  poor kids in Africa would be proppa mad. Hope u eat it afterward m8 not go to waaste cheers
Dam son 400k subs. Not REALLY that surprised though you have very cool kissing pranks on this channel.
dude dylan roof was a gamer assassin he even had the tactical bowl cut
10:00 Holy fuck that scared the shit out of me.
Oh my god, this made my night! First time I properly laughed since your last videos. Keep up the good work Ethan n' Hila!
What are your computer specs?
ETHAN PLAY CSGO WITH ME...  YOU FILTHY SILVER!
Fucking hilarious video this week guys - loved having just a nonsense reaction video that didn't have any kinda social commentary once in a while. Great job!
Please get a haircut, Ethan
we need a gamergear.exe
Wow you got some dank memes there bruv, I'm looking forward to you calling someone a cuck and having footage of a screaming frog in your next video.
HEY I GOT THE SAME KEYBOARD +h3h3productions, I got it for $20 bucks at Big LOTS
really
Dude. My god this video is too fucking funny.
I endorse this product.





h3h3Production not that Gamer Gear bullshit.
Holy fuck, 400k subscribers! Grats dear Uncle!
"Thanks Mr. On the Spectrum"


My sides
ARE YOU CRAZY? ARE YOU OUTTA YOUR MIND DOING THAT TO YOUR KEYBOARD? ( by the way before people keep barging in like saying stfu or somethin its from a reaction vid just saying
Stop making me laugh I'm gonna spit out my coffee
Joel?
Ain't gonna lie your haircut looks like the average chav in Britain.
This is so cringe worthy I almost can't watch it but Ethan is saving it.
BigDaddyWooWoo is the real winner
Do you watch vinesauce?
Dust 2 auto fag :)
He demonstrates the rag that's totally not household supplies marked up in price on a mac monitor. He must be targeting the niche market of PC gamers who play on mac.
Can the Gengin Gamer Duster Cleaner work on my dunnie? It's accumulated a lot of gamer gunk over the years if you dudes and DUDETTES know what I mean.
please check glitterforever17 she is a beauty guru that recommends to little girls to put yogurt in their vaginas
BigDaddyWooWoo has a youtube channel and hes a huge squeaker lmao
Can't wait to give Ethan more jewtube money for destroying goyim.
you guys should probably start selling gamer water on the h3h3 site. i'd buy some. if it works.
Saw the original video forever ago so I didn't think I would like this as much as the others.

The "Bowl Cut" and Ethan gunking up his keyboard more than made up for it. Keep up the good shit.
Holy fuck that bowl cut had me on the floor
I've been waiting for this video for a long time
you talked all that shit about how this stuff isnt wprth the money but you just ruined a 60$ keyboard and mouse ya dingus lol
Congrats on 400K subs!
h3h3 can i be your steam friend since your a gamer?
I thought chimps were attacking my house at 10:03.
Video games is what a real gamer spends his money on, not a fucking can of air. 
Btw, I'm watching this while eating some cookies and a glass of milk, and some splashed on my keyboard. At least they got that right.
And Mr Safety you fucking doofus, you're gonna get some people dead if you just tell them to turn it off. You'd rather switch the power supply off.
that compressed air has to be one of the top ten compressed air cans in the world, gotta be.
CSGO <3
im fine with the cleaning products its whatever, but having a mac shown for gaming? please
scrub
You see, you was supposed to spray the keyboard, wipe it, then gamer dust off it. You fucked up, that's why it's not sparkling clean.
I just want to appreciate the extra mile he goes in all these videos, buying the actual product, buying an actual shit level "gaming" keyboard and all that
What wit the jew fro
So was h3h3 tim and eric before tim and eric, or just been spoofing tim and eric ever since?
Joel would be so proud...
the sudden realization that you have the same gamer gear mouse and keyboard
The laughing scared the shit outta me, thought there was a fucking whale outside or something
I never knew ethan played cs
I CANT BELIEVE THIS CAME OUT A DAY AFTER I ATTEMPTED TO CLEAN MY KEYBOARD. IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN HOW TO ACTUALLY CLEAN IT.
the keyboard shit oh my god i died
I love the video, but, doesn't this just feel really awkward considering how old the video is now, and how most of us have seen it tons of times?
Cleaning disk? Haven't seen one of them since the early 2000's
That laughing legit scared me for a minute there lamao
He says blue ray player so I know this isn't 1997.
JUST
400K SUBS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
People often tell me I have a dirty monitor......they have no idea.
When did h3h3 turn into HowToBasic?
Watching this with a chest cold is the worst thing. I don't know if I'm coughing from the cringe, or from the cold. Either way it sucks.
Until 5:30 or so I was convinced he was a drug dealer trying to sell adderal.
I was actually wiping my ass with a baby wipe as he was talking about wiping his ass with a baby wipe... I'm serious, what a coincidence...
i watched thus drunk and i think i went to hell
Awww man I already saw this on ChedTRonic
Nice Dota sticker :D
Not Safe For Master Race
6:21 WHAT, my wifu is joining the terrorist`s
h3h3 please do fouseytubes latest prank it is literally sexual assault
I keep taking off my headphones at 10:04 this sounds like someone is behind me what have you fucking done Ethan.
That small weekend hair cut
who even has a dvd player anymore nubs
You reached 400k subs at the exact same time as Pyrocynical
What's Ethan's Steam handle?
I don't know why but this is the most cringeworthy thing I've seen on youtube. It actually hurts me
One of your funniest yet dude! That water shot! Oh my lobster knuckles! 
So...according to the hip ass bomb ass gamer man, we have a Mortal Kombat third person shooter coming? pshshew! pshew! Pshew! FINISH HIM!!
h3h3 why aren't you more popular on youtube? You literally expose people's videos for being fake, or people using YouTube to simply make money. You, on the other hand, expose these people and are comedic fucking gold.
really.exe
This was on point.
The guy looks like Sid from Ice Age.
DOTA 2 > LOL
Why didn't you hold your keyboard like an accordion when you used the game spray?
I actually liked your bowl cut, Ethan. It looked fly af fam.
i think your hair still looks good with that haircut man
a new h3h3 productions video on me birthday?! how marvelous!!!
Pleaseeeee do a video on Adrian gee
When I saw H3's 'bowl' cut I laughed my ass off...while I was drinking Pepsi, I was coughing like shit for 5 minutes after.
I was hoping you'd do this one.
Ethan please keep commenting on big channels, there is a channel named BikiniFitnessModel that doesn't get age restrictions and clearly is porn
It's good to see that Topher Grace is still getting work after leaving That 70's Show early and being in Spider-Man 3.
You actually look really fucking good with that broccoli cut m8
Ethan now looks like sam pepper
This has to be the funniest reaction video you've done so far :-) So much shame onto this guy.....much shame.....
What you did to that keyboard and mouse was worse than hair cake.
the way the guy looks and talks in the video doing the gaming gear reminds me of Robby the old equals 3 host lol
top notch vid 10/10 but i was hoping you were going to pull out a fire extinguisher on that keyboard
I'm too poor to be a real gamer with all of this gamer gear, I need a small loan of a million dollars
400k Congrats man!
This h3h3 vid just turned into HowToBasic real fast
@ 8:15. If this kid joins ISIS we're fucked.
I threw up laughing at 3:42 fuck sake!
That Really is gonna' be the next "WHAT ARE YA? CRAZY?"

8:02 I thought he said Germans so I burst out laughing.
#gAmERGeaRsQuAD
okay. i have to ask. the intro : is that michelle obama? I can't figure out who it is
That haircut is amazing though!
Aw man, calling women 'dudette' and cleaning my gamer gear with Dust-off gamer spray, not only is my gamer gear cleaner with minimal nacho cheese and cum stains I have still never touched a woman! But it gives me hope and the bowl cut I have will surely improve my gaming assassination skills on my gaming pc with my gaming mouse and gaming keyboard and gaming wank sock and gaming restraining order bracelet! Thanks Ethan and Hila for making my gamer assassin lifestyle the best one yet! REALLY!
400k subs that's awesome
+h3h3Productions You guys should be careful.  Fat Jew (The Joke Stealer) might give you a strike for stealing his haircut.
Ethan why havent you hit 1 million subs already
Ethan you didn't even drink that water, you just poured it on your mouth.
Unsubscribed.
it looks like he has a perm
This guy just became a human meme in one video.
you stole my nuclear h2o idea you frikkin n00b
Will it work now that i got sodipop all over my laptop from laughter?

0:29 That must have been some hardcore Farmville you were playing there.
Really.exe
Does Ethan actually play CS:GO?
I'm so happy you guys went back to the old format. The one where it shows Ethan commenting over the clips.

You forgot the best part of the gaming gear arsenal.

Using the Dust-Off to get high as fuck before you put a game on.
As I lye here in bed eating starburst I question my life whist scrolling through my sub box, but then out in the distance I see a small glowing light, I panic. I throw my starbursts on the floor as I ran shamelessly to my computer. Yes, it's real a NEW H3h3 upload. I give my thanks And grace to a certain DJ, before I watch. God bless
navi lol
You deserve so many more subs.

Gamer Water? That is just mountain dew man
He finally reacted to this video
Ethan should go to a CSGO tournament and throw Tostitos™ at the other players, forcing them to use Dust-off™ to clean the gamer gunk
Papa bless

My keyboard is covered in a thick coat of cum, and Mountain Dew.
No joke that spray was able to clear up that cheese before you started messing around
Gamer Gear is fucking stupid, but it's targeted at fucking stupid people. I'm not talking about gamers as a whole, but just genuinely stupid people.
Watch the Daniel Songer comedy bits, especially CONDUM SMILE

that bowl cut makes you look like the majority of 12 year olds today
First Joel, then Chad, now you

I'm happy now.

I heard Gamer Gear is better than the Civ 5 Brave New World Expansion Pack.
"awwwww maaaaan, just look at all that crap flying out of there!"
I bet gamer water is better than diamond water.
Whoa, really?? 400 000 dudes and dudettes! This channel is growing real fast
Welcome to youtube where you can jerk your little ding dong

I just snapped when I saw Ethan's hair cut
REALLY

God dude, what you did to that keyboard hurt me.
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY
This is like what happens if you get some random actor to black up and pretend to be down with the streets
The surround sound at 10:02 scared the shit out of me, sounded real as hell.
fuck W-D40! where has the gamer gunk cleaner been my whole life!
Ethan have you / do you play Dora 2?
Ethan Beckham Jr.
These game assassins and their weapon gears with the solid reaches and the grand fallout offensives.
Oh my... The cringe was real on this one...

the great overueberunderachiever
The hilarious thing is I actually use this shit.  I only got it cause it was cheap at walmart, I didn't know they had this cringe inducing advertizing campaign. Oh well, I have a case of a meme.
I think that the jewfro is adding to the autistic-man-child concept of this channel.






                            Trut
                             H

I REALLY hope that that's not how that kid acts on the Internet
that hair is actually on point tho
New meme for every video

I don't think this guy was doing it clean at all.
Just want to point out. At 1:56 in the source video, he puts the CD in backwards.
Aren't you a little big to be a broccoli assassin though? JK ily bb
thumbs up if you think ethan actually looks good with that hair cut
this video was good and way to funny. who else thinks h3h3 productions needs a gaming channel it would be so funny if eithen played video games

I pray for a R-r-r-r-really.exe
I hate those fake "gaming" gear, that's why I use my Gunnar's gaming scarf to optimise my neck for peak performance by dialating the temperature around my neck so I can perform perfectly.
TIL Fuccbois have the same haircut as broccoli assassins
This dude looks so similar to Ross from Game Grumps I think we need to ask a few more questions
YESSSS. Everyday, a part of me dies when I get on YouTube and there isn't an upload from you guys

GIVE ME THE GAMER JUICE FUEL ME
Close to 400.000 Subscribers!
Thank you for all the goofs Ethan, Papa bless ya.
I feel like this whole channel is an elaborate prank to find the point at which the cringe goes too far and we all unsubscribe
I need to clean my gamer dildo
REALLY
JUST
my favorite anime is game shacker.
Small lol of a million gamers!
nice macklemore haircut Ethan keep it up
Saw this shit at frys electronics.  I was tripping out why they had a single can of compressed air for 15 dollars next to the 3 packs of compressed air for 8 dollars
The cringiest thing was what you did to your poor keyboard like jesus

I fucking love all your edits
As someone with ASD, I pissed myself laughing at the spectrum joke, literally.
thank mr.safety
"Just fuck me up fam" hahahahaha
you have out done yourself with the bowl cut
HE LOOKS LIKE THE WEEKND WITHOUT THE BACK OH MY GOD
"REALLY" is now a replacement of "ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!"
xXBROccoliassassinXx
Hila turned Ethan into a paintbrush
dudettes this is a treat
Woah! I bet there's a whole Papa John's Pizza in that keyboard!
papa has returned
I'm gonna start saying "Thanks Mr. On-The-Spectrum" more often! When Ethan said that, I lost it.
Ethan does not own a mechanical keyboard, I'm seriously disappointed
my dream is to be a pro gamer but i dont have $20 to buy proper gaming cleaner gear what do i do???
Ahahahahahaha xD
Yes
Ethan, we need a REALLY.EXE! PLEEEEEEASE :D
give this man a small loan of a million dollars
It makes me cringe just thinking about cleaning that dank gaming set up. RIP dank gaming keyboard. :/
nice brocoli hair
the guy who kills him at 6:23 has a youtube channel too,  4eyes 13
this video hurts forreal
pretty sure the guy in the commercial was autistic. besides that this video was edgy as fuck. 420/360 would fap again
You look like the Weeknd with that cut.
comic sans sans.....hmmmmm underpants.....sans?
This just made my day! Now I'm ready for work tommorrow!
when are you guys are going to stream again on twitch??
Does every good youtuber play cs:go?
a small loan of a million dollars
R.I.P Sean
REALLY?!
Im surprised that guy didn't offer DLC pack 
He should advertise EA games
XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
OMG IT'S ABEL
love the Sam pepper cut. please keep it.
This was your best video in a while Ethan. Keep it up. Proud of you
That giggling with surround sound was 3spookie42me
If you got a small loan of a million dollars you could just buy new gear instead of cleaning it
LMFAO! DAT HAIRCUT! So damn sexy.
"It is not a paper towel and window cleaner. It is not that." was not very convincing. If only they'd inserted a short clip immediately after that sentence of the presenter slightly bobbing his neck backwards, widening his eyes and declaiming "REALLY", then I would have had utter confidence in what they were saying.
ETHAN SAID FAM BRB
mister safety......yeah its just the fucking engineer

whats the calorie content of a spider web?
Advertisements during the video??? ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MOOYND?
Wouldn't mind playing Counter Strike with Ethan some time.
gz on 400k
Faker is a broccoli assassin. You got this Ethan.
The reason marketers think "gamers" are dumb as shit is because "gamers" regularly prove themselves to be dumb as shit. The reason they market the way they do is, because it works. They don't do anything unless it makes money. Most of the gaming public regularly buys into the hype cycle surrounding the gaming industry.
why is it that when people outside the community talk about gaming it's so cringeworthy? oh yea wait they're clueless idiots
A filthy frank and h3h3 vid in one weekend I feel blessed
The mega cringe.
HAHAHAHAHA! Seriously Ethan I thought your hair was a wig dude.

REALLY!
I've always wondered who the woman in the into saying 'I'm proud of you' is
Uh, wheres sean? How long has he been gone, hes not in the intro.

Jokes on you Ethan, you bought one of their products
To be fair , I'm not a gamer , but my keyboard is disgusting .
I've always wondered, did Michelle actually make that little snipit for him or did he grab it from somewhere?
Love the videos - keep it up!
As a professional gamer I can tell you all these products are solid enough to buff away the cheeto dust I've left on my controller and keyboard for months. 
10/10, would REALLY use again
I'm 8 years old. Is gamer water safe for me to drink?
Just when you thought the guy couldn't get any cringe-er...
I think I had to pause this video like 5 times because I was cringing to much
best video of the year
I´m a true game assasin. I go to gamestop everyday and backstab every single game without dying even once. The employees call the cops on me every single time. Damn admins abusing their powers.
That guy's mom is pretty hot...
You gotta wipe from the front... but the ladies can't do that tho
Small loan gone wild, one million dollars given
My neck hurts...the cringe
You look like that "fat jew" dickhead with your hair like that
This guy seems like the kind of guy who'd try to use memes whenever he talks to people.
ez way 2 global
the laughing scared the shit out of me!
TOO FUCKING CRINGE
lmao the comic sans warning
OMFG, after your haircut you look like FaZe Rain!

Even funnier than Chadtronic's reaction! Nice moves, keep it up.
REALLY????????????????
Ay, the new video. Good job, proud of you.
This gamer queer cleaning his gamer gear.
Ethan, PLEASE use the "really" cut scene in future videos (sort of like how you use the "are you outta ya mind?!?!" one.
damn ethan you lookin hip with that hair cut, legit i could see you bloggin sipping tea while vaping in your wingtips
Finally, a product that removes dust and crumbs, why has no one ever thought of this before!!
( ͡º ͜ʖ ͡º)
Mr G?
Uncle jobel anyone?
Lol he is cosplaying Super Mario Maker at 9:34.
Ethan what is your steam nickname? I will give you a nova|sand dune man.
Lookin' like The Weeknd with dat broccoli cut.
0:15 DotA 2 instead of LoL <3 Love you, guys.
That's absolute gold. Well done
You fucked up your hair because of this gamer assass-hole. Bless your soul.
Plz put a cringe warning at the start next time
Ethan I loved this video, papa bless ya
6:11 Ethan's inner Doctor Steve Brule spilling from the precipice of his psyche.
I'd sell my 2010 Dell computer gaming beast for these state of the art gaming gear.
Then I can finally run CS:GO and pretend I'm good at video-games. Game Assassins 4 lyfe.
This game assassin is like a younger, nerdier Tom Kinney.
8:47 You know he is a pro gamer! A real mac? whoa!
REEALYY!? xd
u could have given dat keyboard to a starving kid in africa
FOOTAGE OF ACTUAL GAMER GONE WILD AND SEXUAL 2016 PRANK GONE WRONG GONE PRANK

That's a fresh fade fam.
A broccoli cut will be the new thing, it sort of already is :')
r-r-r-r-r-r-really? This is gold.
What the fuck Ethan, I can't believe you wasted all those Doritos and cheese on that keyboard just for this video, I am appalled and disgusted, frankly. Do you not think about starving homeless people that could use that? Just because you gave a homeless dude 7 cents one time you probably think you're exempt. Next time you try a skit like this, think of the gamers in Africa that could use a new keyboard before destroying it.
YASSSS WAITING FOR A NEW VIDEO
YASSSS WAITING FOR A NEW VIDEO
Nice video Ethan! This has needed to be addressed for ages. All the FaZe members trying to sell their Gamma drink. Which you can buy from the shop for peanuts
I cringed so hard at the sight of this keyboard and all that cheese. chips and gamer air! XD
kids in africa could have fragged those noobs!
that fucking laughing scared the shit out of me

oh god.... OH GOD NO! I think i just got cancer.
may one day you, frank and ian unite


amen
Hibernate is off! Fuck.
YOU FINALLY DID THIS VIDEO. OH MY GOD. THANK YOU ETHAN.
Chadtronic already did it months ago.. But i'm sure that this one is going to be a looot better :D
So glad you did this. I've been waiting very impatiently for a new vid.
You bought an auto?
Ethan probably had his own rank: Global Meme
CRINGE
navi is back!
Let me get this straight... 
He said that the computer should be COMPLETELY off, and then proceeds to open the tray to insert the "specially formulated dust-off cleaning disc". "Follow the instructions on the screen", he said. 
R E A L L Y ? !
ohhhh 10 mins of h3h3
Gotta stay healthy as a gamer. Gettin some of that broccoli hair.
Hey ethan what's your mmr
And this is why I can't admit to playing videogames IRL
filthy franks rubbing off on this mother fucker
REALLY!?!?
"Do not clone yourself"
To be fair, it's the only way that guy will ever get laid.
Just imagine him sucking his clone until he slurps up all the "gamer gunk".

selfcestselcestitsthebestputyourselftothetest
This guy can really connect with the kids
I'M SOLD! I'M BUYING THIS ASAP!

"You can't do it dirty, you gotta do it clean."

papa plays cunter stroke dam
how can i earn the title of mr on the spectrum?
Where can I purchase this cleaner gear games air? I think that my keyboard is in need of this top quality air
He is talking about "gaming gear". Then the obsession with hygiene would make slightly more sense.
3:41 For some reason he reminds me of The Weekend
That haircut is currently a trend, over here in the UK at least anyway.
Thanks for the knowledge dad, good moves as always.
Wow ur using a fukin auto sniper in CSGO, u fokin n00b

"Fuck me up fam"
Thanks H3H3 for giving me a reason to not off myself today! Looks like I'm moving one step closer to the endless void of nothingness the old fashioned way.
This episode had some MillionDollarExtreme inspiration with the keyboard stuff, am I wrong Ethan?
Great bowl cut, Ethan! But when are you going to break out the colander cut? Word on the street is n00bs can't handle all them holes...
Best video yet also keep that SoFloBro going
Ethan is a fuckin trend setter with that broccoli cut. Damn, I know I'll be seeing that look around town real quick.

Lol the video is so stupid but I actually use the duster that they are advertising

Ethan's hair turned into the one that pretentious organ guy had.
I was waiting for you to watch this
Now you can just buy your viruses from a company that sells compressed air!
Guess I'm not a real gamer :/
"And that's how you use Gamer Gunk: Cleaner Geengur." Dead.
I only use Diamond Air™ for cleaning my keyboard.

You're not a gamer if you don't have cool gamer gear like Razer.

Give me the memes, I need the memes
This video made me cry.

Great work!
What if there's cum on my controller?
"Thank you mr. On the spectrum"

Dude this is honestly my favorite channel. I cant wait till you hit 1,000,000 subs guys. Ive never been so excited every week to watch your content. Keep it up!
great vid
This made me cringe. I dont know how else to put it.
Ethan now has a haircut like 70% of 16 year old boys in the UK
How to Masturbate (Jack off)
1. Grab it sideways(kinda like your gonna play an accordion)
2. Slam it in the nearest door for as long as you can 
3. After 3-4 minutes of slamming you should be ready to "Splooge"
4. Run to your nearest gaming paraphernalia (we recommend a rock band drum kit)
5. Let your "Sweet Goop" flow out like a river.
6. After you're finished (unloading your clip) use Dust Off™ Gaming Gear cleaner to remove the mess!




-Brought to you by the lifeless marketers at Dust Off Corp!
small lone of a million dudets
lol they sold these in the place i used to work
Please react to cassidy boon <3 That bitch needs ur attention

Your dedication to a joke is appreciated.

That broccoli haircut makes you look like a cool, hip youtuber who pranks all day long. Thats the exact opposite of 
a game-assassin
Check 'em. Dubs get dudettes and gamer gear.
Broccoli gamer is an actual channel with Minecraft videos
I always knew the reason my keyboard was covered in a thick layer of man ooze was because I was just a hardcore gamer
Small loan of a million gamer gunk
With that new hair cut you can totally start raping women on Youtube, I mean pranking.
👍🏻😂👍🏻😂👍🏻😂
Hila is so pretty
you look like Danny Brown now

Can I drink my gaming water even if I'm not gaming? (in emergencies, of course)
I thought I was cringeworthy when I bought an air compressor for 1000$ just to clean my PC and keyboard, but this canned air shit is something else.
Great moves, keep it up, proud of you.
Really?
This kid looks like ross from game grumps..... i can't ever watch game grumps again
so where can I buy this gear
I hope the guy got paid well, because this shit will haunt him for life.
I have the same keyboard. Which means I'm a gamer.
im a brocoli assasin
So, someone's been watching some papa franku recently.
Really?
This is probably your funniest video so far. I literally lost my mind when you had cheese dip all over your keyboard and mouse. Please keep making videos you are the funniest person on youtube.

Fuck Dust-Off gamer spray, I need Semen-Off spray.
My fucking splooge has been feeding off my Doritos crumbs and im housing babies in their third trimester in my fucking keyboard.

I need someone to perform an illegal abortion on my Keyboard so I can get back to playing CounterStrike.
thanks daddy xdxd
I totally don't say dude/dudette when chatting with random people.

Wow dude that new broccoli cut is dank af, you should keep it ;)

When the cringe is too strong.
REALLY
Why the fuck is everyone shaving their hair!
Is there anyway a skinny white male can get some cheap chub and tuck lessons? I'm going through a great struggle :(
i say dudette unironically.
A lot of sacrifices were made during filming of this video.
With that cut, Ethan can be a Fifa Fag
I love how you always put numerous takes of the same thing in your videos instead of editing it to only one take. Shit, if all the takes are good, may as well throw em in.
we need a .exe of this NOW
Papa ethan has come back after 1 week without posting. god bless papa ethan
The fuckin cringe
best one
Is it just me  or is Ethan coming off as more angry than mocking in these recent videos?
Almost 400 fucking K subscribers dude!
This guy is the only good reactor on YT he deserves the subs Jinx has
A masterpiece
thank god, now i can finally continue to live my life
REALLY!
I just realized I bought the same monitor as Ethan. You piece of shit, you have been subliminally marketing AOC monitors you filthy shill.
yo ethan fresh cut lol
Gotta love cringe worthy 20 something year olds living in their moms basement cleaning their gamer gear
This guy reminds me of Mattpatt. Both cringeworthy fags
man your hair was cool. NOW IS GAME ASSASSIN INCARNATE
pls sell gamer gear merch
oh yes
Ethan's becoming Cameron Carpenter with that haircut
One of the top ten haircuts in the world
Gotta be
my vomit reflexes reacted to what you did with your keyboard, have my like
Normal video - watch, like 
H3H3 video - like, watch 

;))
almost 400k subs!!! :D
The keyboard scene made me cringe so hard.
4:43 As a PC Gamer this made me cringe harder than ever in my entire life jesus christ. I CAN FEEL THE DIP ON MY KEYS NOW
Hi bitch X
Anyone wanna know a dirty little secret? Huh do ya? Do ya?
Don't you think it's ironic that the only two keys at J and K.
Seems fitting....
Wow
 You fucked up your keyboard haha
Ethan you're gonna need a small loan of a million dollars
New memes! Yes!
small loan of 1,000,000 dollars
The only positive thing I took away from this video is that Ethan has the same computer case as me


Gamer Assassins Unite! Blows brains out
The cringe is real.
I have never laughed so hard in my life
its obvious this gamer assassin  gets SoFloAntonio's dick.
I love you
"game assassins"

Triggered as fuck
This is so cringe I almost tought that it was a sketch
Seeing the cheese drip over the keyboard made me wince so hard I had to stop the video.

I think I'm good, here's the thumbs up. Good bye.
to be honest Ethan looked like a normal British person with that hair cut
fucKING HOT
Cringyness level over 9000.....
damn mane, with that hair cut you look like a black rnb artist ready to grind on someone. heck, dye the top blonde, give Hila a black eye, write some shitty music and you'll be Chris Brown
OMG I BOUGHT THE SAME PIECE OF SHIT $2 LOGITECH KEYBOARD
give ethen a small loan of a million dollars https://www.patreon.com/h3h3productions?ty=h
#PrayForKeyboard
Aw, you ended the video without pointing out that the "gamer" guy has his computer ON (that spells O N and not O F F) while he's starting to "clean" it with his compact disc full of soap or whatever the heck they put in those things (nothing?)
Many keks were had.
Bro, I was wearing HD Sennheiser headphones and 10:02 startled me. I thought there was someone to my left scraping something on the floor.
ethan u need a fucking tv show. i love u
Enjoy the goofs and gaffs, dudes and dudettes.
He was verbally spamming me I'm not sure if he actually said anything
....JOEL????
I came across the video of gamer gear guy a few months back. I thought it couldn't get any funnier then the original video itself...apparently I was incorrect.
My gaming gear is basically playing in a toaster
Not the best h3h3 video...Could be the video picked but none of this made me laugh. You guys have more entertaining videos when you pick someone really weird or you expose douchebags.
Gamer dudes and dudets
Best fucking reaction oh my god this is insane love you guys
I have so much work to do why did you have to upload
kill them all
the broccoli assassin look isn't complete without the chub n' tuck to go with it for maximum noob pwning!
It felt like Mr. Safety was gonna take his clothes O.F.F.F.F.F. 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
DO A BUZZFEED REACTION VIDEO! THOSE GUYS GOT OUT OF CONTROL!
honestly you should have over 1,000,000 subscribers. it's seriously a crime that you don't.
Oh my god, I almost choked laughing.

This guy is like made of Cringe or something.
I still can feel THE CRINGE
mY BRAiN HURTS so much !!11
Can't watch this one. The cringe from that guy in the video is too much.
Am I the only one who has seen this on cringe factor before... You know the series that Dexter Manning used to do...
The extra cost for Gamer Gear is a big tip.
JOEL, DID YOU NOT CLEAN UP YOUR GAMING GEAR JOEL!?

YOU SHIT CHILD.
The reason he used Comic Sans is because, if you don't buy Dust-Off Gamer Spray, you're gonna have a bad time.
holy w o w. this guy
that haircut is very dank , looks like one of those new hipster cuts very hip and sexy, very nazi
Some serious cringe here Ethan, real find. 
On an unrelated note, I just took a shit and I think one of my vertebrae came out of my ass.
csgo fgt
how much did it cost to bring the computers back home from israel? and whats the name of the hip girl piece cus I want that
I love Counter-Strike
he looks like an anime character that can change into a snake

If you don't have that haircut in the next video, I'm going to be sorely disappointed Ethan.

That gear is worth a small loan of a million dollars $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
