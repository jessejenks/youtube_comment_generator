Eugene x taco bell = yas
no shawarma???!?
"KFC! THERE, I SAID IT!"
Ned is obviously drunk but it's like he has the munchies😂
um, CHIC FIL A? lol
I... I don't like fried chicken
"You don't know that!" "Yes I do! Ronald's my neighbor!"-Eugene
this is hilarious
Zach is a happy little elf when he's drunk
"we can't eat Pizza Hut without sauce"
"Better people, papa johns......NEXT"
I'm in tears 😂😂😂😂 One of the best videos. I love to see the try guys drunk 😂😂
I honestly think this is my favorite try guys video
I want someone to talk about me like how Eugene talks about that taco.
When Keith got mad because there was no sauce I started crying😂😂😭
are they all gay? lol
You know Eugene is fucked when he starts showing emotion
1:59 omg is it me or does keith sound like bianca del rio here
I need to get drunk with these guys.
I am the person who wants to see that. 
I love Zach. I think he's so hot... shush
And people say only black people eat KFC.....ummm try again
Why did they pick Pizza Hut? At least get the best pizza place like Papa Johns or Dominoes!
Love them when they are not drunk,and love them even more when they are DRUNK!
i would kill a bear... for a KFC meal..........



#KFC4LIFE
I'm getting hungry watching this
Yeah Ronald's my neighbor
I love Eugene so much
Can we discuss what happened at 1:51 because it kills me wha Keith said
oh Ned hahahhaha
Doesn't seen whataburger

These people haven't lived yet.
Okay but tell me if I got a weird piece or something, but i had a bad experience with KFC... Because, I took a bite of it, and it was pure bone with a thin layer of literally only grease and batter. I cant explain it, it drizzled out just while oil with tiny chunks of fat. I tried to find the meat, but i only ran into bone and more of that weird grease thing.... literally im now a vegan.
I want to get drunk with all of them now. Especially Eugene, and Keith. I would have the time of my life!

3:52 Keith had me in years. Whatarewedoing? it literally sounded like that lmfao
this is a try guy shoot on acid
WHAT ARE WE DOING?!?! WHAT ARE WE DOING?!?!
Hilirious
This is one of the best videos i have ever watched 😂😂😂😂
I like them drunk:)
"No one wants to see that Zach" stares at Zach's butt for a little too long
OH sweet! KY REPRESENT!~ Keith likes my states food.
"Oh my gawd. OH MY GAWD." 😂
McDonalds and Burger king has nothing on Hesburger. If u ever get the chance to eat those babies, take it.
Y'all bugging 😂 KFC nasty
I got drunk and ate like 6 tacos locos it was bad
Eugene is just so hilarious in this video.
Make a part two, watching drunk people eat is sooo entertaining.
Eugene: I want the taco bell
covers mouth oh my gosh sjxhhdidjd
oh my god ned hahahahh
I'm just sitting here shipping Zach and Eugene sooooo hard
Ned and keith
Zach: do you think it would taste good if we combined them?
Eugene and Keith try it
Keith: no that's terrible, that was a bad decision. Even a drunk person knows that's bad. yuck yuck yuck yuck ew.
Any one else pee at the side of the toilet so it doesn't make any noise.
Popeyes is way better than KFC in my opinion
keith: I normally don't support the monarchy
Me: blending up the I made america script and pouring it over my naked body
Can we have Sober try guys reacting to this video?
Keith got so emotional over the fried chicken X'D
I wish someone loved me as much as Keith loves fried chicken
why two men, eating 1 chicken at same time? i'm worried.
I wonder if they remember shooting this video. If not, can we have them react to it?
"But the burger hamburger at the whopper king place" 😂😂😂
Only liked this bc of Eugenes reaction to the taco from Taco Bell
Lord of the fries... missed opportunity, Keith.
Frame broiled 😂😂😂
Okay so what I've gathered from the video:
-Drunk Keith yells a lot 
-Drunk Eugene talks more than normal 
-Drunk Ned is plain silly
-Drunk Zach looks like he is gonna cry 😂
THIS IS THE BEST TRY GUYS VIDEO EVER
3:51 me in exams
Drunk Keith is me all the time...
4:54 all transgenders need to go to KFC
Eugene was so shocked he liked taco bell while drunk omfg
this was amazingggggggg
i'm probably one of the few people in this world who hates KFC. never liked the taste of their food. Popeye's is much better in my opinion.
3:51 - Me when I think about politics in America. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
What other job do you get to be drunk for 😂
Eugene acts like a thirteen year old when he's drunk I love it
Quotes (pt two):

"I don't see the Doritos in this?"
-Ned

"Yes I think KFC was incredible, There I said it! It blew my brain apart!!!"
-Keith

"I could eat a whole pizza drunk by myself. I HAVE eaten whole pizzas drunk by myself!"
-Eugene

"Do you think that Ronald McDonald paints his WHOLE body?"
-Zack
keith has the biggest mouth on youtube
KFC taste like onions on the skin
burger king
when eugene said i hate taco bell i died inside aaahhhhh
Go to work get drunk and eat food best job ever!!!
Keith is having a saucy melt down while Eugene is just getting on with it👌😍
ned trying the burgers gave me life

At 3:51 Kieth is me in math! 😂
i love Zach when hes drunk
I CRACKED UP WHEN KEITH STARTED SHOUTING ABOUT CHICKEN
If they love Taco Bell, they should try Mexican tacos😍👅
I laughed so hard I almost cried 😂😂😂
olivia newton john travolta
I died when Ned was shoving the taco in and out of the paper thing
theyre all so giggly and excitable when drunk and its the only reason im alive
What we learned to day Ned can not speak when he is drunk
"The burger hamburger at the whopper king place."
the try guys look like that they'd  be like  be gone from me I'm on YouTube I'm higher then you common people
la la la best part
zach is so cute wtf
Drunk eating Taco Bell while watching this video
so wasted
I love how Eugene's accent changes almost every time he speaks😂😂
drunk ned is my favorite
Watching this stoned xD
Zach is so cute when he's drunk
Hey Eugene, get drunk with me.
i love them <3
Omg i love ned so much this is hilariouss
inaudible crying
Ned and Zach are my favorite😂
I'm crying😂😂
There so crazy in normal life, they don't really seem different apart from Eugene
drunk Try Guys is the best thing on this planet
lalala
idk why but I died when he made the Papa John's reference lol
Zach is an adorable cutie pie and I wanna sit on his face
Make a video of them not shaving for a week. I wanna see them with stubbles.
Pizza Hut is the best while I'm drunk.
la la la
There's a lot of gays at buzzfeed lol
I guess eugine is the boss😂
I don't know if it's just me but I can't stand any of these morons.
Is it just me or do they act more Gay when the are drunk. Lol
I need more Keith
3:52 I'm dead😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😅😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅
Wtf I love this!!
Actual mexican tacos are like 10000x times better than Taco Bell
Did Ned not mention his wife???!!!
Oh man they are all so funny drunk :D I've watched this video so many times already!
Zach is the cutest when he is drunk
"Until I've been drunk"
popeyes was definitely better lol
Who else got hungry watching this video? ;-;
"Everyone loves fried chicken." I...I don't... Also is it weird that I was eating pizza while watching this?
"Put me a bathtub full of bifscuits"
keith said taco bell cant win without sauce. TRUTH
Am I just a big winner ? Everybody's a winner lol
kfc ftw
😂😂😂😂❤
Watching them do that drunk made me laugh so hard my parents thought I was literally dying. Eugene is my favorute thou in all honesty.
True confession: I come back and watch this at least once a day - usually more. It's just so damn funny!
Why did they give Ned's burger vote to McDonald's? He only preferred the fries. He liked the Burger King burger better.
When he says "I can eat a whole pizza" I thought a pizza was one serving :(

I've eaten 2 on occasion
Who else thought it was so cute when Zach was singing 'la la la'??
keith 😂😂 omg I laugh so hard omg😂
They are so funny especially drunk😂
these guys are making so happy
Better sauce better seasoning better people papa jonhs
Well it's not like they're actually much different...
4:29 (Ned's Face) That face you make when you discover how babies are made.
They're all so beautiful when drunk
they dont seem drunk 0_0
the real challenge will be on the toilet
I never eaten a taco
From buzz feed I probably like the try guys the most cause they are ok with swearing.
"It blew my brain apart" i died😂😂😂
0:58

NED YOU HAVE A WIFE!!!
wait...did Ned not mention his wife....
Everyone check out my best friend channel!!! Her name is Izzy 193 she want me to give as many shoutouts as possible!
I hate KFC, the skin is so soggy all the time ;-;
Drunk eugene reminds me of markiplier
Wendy's win
watching them eat is making me hungry!!!!!
Are they drunk or high
Keith is my favorite person ever
I feel like Eugene is not that drunk, maybe he has a high tolerance towards alcohol
BuzzFeedVideo Ned is so funny when he's drunk, but he keeps talking about his wife in other videos, which is irritating.
Is it normal that I don't get drunk even after 6 shots of vodka ???     I even used a breathalyzer test.
4:13 zach is literately me omfg 😂
Were they drunk or on methamphetamine?
"but the burgerhamburger et the whopper king place... ekmeph." 1:33
Oh my god I'm dying of laughter xD keep doing what you do try guys <3
I cannot drunk eat, it makes me sick.  Even if I eat before there's a serious limit to how much I can eat versus drink once I start drinking.  I can down a lot, but my stomach doesn't want layers, it's starts this reaction that's bad where the alcohol rejects any real meal following its consumption.  It's like a club that says so many guys are in, but at a certain point it only wants ladies... no more guys invited in killing the buzz for those original guys.  XD
3:49
Even the idea is drunk.
Round 1: Burger vs Burger.
Round 2: Fried Chicken vs Fried Chicken
Round 3: Pizza vs . . . Taco?. . .
Wah?
True mcdonalds fries are bomb but the whopper is where it is at
Keith oml so funny
lol this is amazing
4:14 😂😂
"I didn't realize Big Macs were so pickley until I've been druuunk" - Eugene
i want to meet zack
KFC over Popeyes's any day
The part when they try Taco Bell was exactly the same reaction I had when I tried the dorito taco
"No one wants to see you , Zack"
Well apparently you do, Eugene 😂 wink wink
Drunk Keith is the best lol
ZACH IS SO CUTE...I LOVE HIM!! 😍😂😣
2.7 million views  I love the try guys
I love when zach giggles!!!!
I'm not a big fan of Fried chicken
3:48 is me everytime I have taco bell and my friends forget the hot-hot sauce.

"DONT TOUCH ME MAN, YOU HAVE LOST MY TRUST, YOU GET NOTHING BUT SADNESS. MAY GOD FORGIVE YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE."
This is the funniest videos of THE try guys. Keith and Eugene just make it even funnier at the end.
"Final verdict the fries at mcdonalds are better but the burger [burp] hamburger at the whopperking [laughing]" I LOVE THEM
I love Zach's laugh soooo much. lol
Lol "they both come in a box"
LOL they are so much funnier drunk
is there cheffette
I wanna be a Try Guy/Girl, but then I remembered I'm like 10 years younger than them all ;-;
#getzachpapajohns
EUGENE REFRENCED GREASE HE NOW HAS MY HEART!
Omg I'm laughing so hard hahahahahhahaha 
Eugene cried because of a TacoBell!!!! Hahahahah I'm so done
Sooo much cattier and sassier drunk. Flippin hilarious.
What do drunks vegans eat? 
Their tears of jealousy?
Favorite drunk Try Guy? For me it's a toss-up between Zach and Keith. They are both such happy drunks.
Lol I love eugene when he said "I would eat taco Bell Drunk"  like a teenager saying their crush lol
chicken cool ranch taco (sober or drunk)...
"LA LA LA!" Legit my favorite part 😂😂
I love you all equally
taco bell drunk is the greatest
This. Editing. Gold.
Why did zach switch from eugene to keith?
Wait... So does this mean that nobody else gets waffles when they're drunk? I swear waffles are the TRUE Beat Drunk Food. Please try it!
this was so amazingly funny I love it sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sooo so much, and when kieth was like 'what are we doing' when there was no source it killed me
"LA LA LA..."
Do a HIGH food test!!!
This is my favorite video of all time
POPEYE ALL DAY! KFC doesn't even taste like chicken.
Drunk Ned laughing at his own jokes is my spirit animal
Mine will be burger king and toca bell
I couldn't stop laughing when Eugene started crying about the fact that he would eat taco bell drunk
What a whopper of a video!
Ned is great in this video. Everything about this makes me laugh so hard. I swear they're a lot more like me and my friends when they're drunk 😂
Pizza should be against pizza
I love them
LA LA LA 😂😂😂😂
The problem with their reviews is they never come to any sort of decisive decision on what is best. Everyone just disagrees and that makes the review pretty useless.
Are the guys gay 😂
The editing on this video is the best.
What are we doing!!
LA LA LA~
I like how Eugene, the coolest, sexiest guy on the planet, is the least cool out of all the Try Guys when drunk.
what I got from the end of the video. you have no friends your life is miserable
im at the pizza hut! I'm at the taco bell! I'm at the combination pizza hut and taco bell!
Bojangles beats KFC and Popeyes all day everyday.
People get 20× funnier when thier drank
"it was just a stray piece of lettuce" IM LAUGHING
La La La...PAPA JOHN'S!!!
Where is the Try Guys try a 4 man orgy episode? This was close to that.
Make another one
zacks drunk laugh is so cute im crying
I CAN'T TELL IF THEY'RE DRUNK OR NORMAL XD
There is no arguing about that Keith LOVES KFC Fried Chicken, here's proof: 4:51. I like it too but here in Finland we don't have KFC's which is sad IMO.
PAPA bless
THIS IS SO HILARIOUS
to be honest now that im sober i dont remember typing those comments and now that in sober pest ffr is kfc even tho u need water and soda afterwards
Doritos locos taco is he only thing I EVER get at Taco Bell, sadly I go there too often
Zach and Eugene is  my brotp
I'm just laughing
they almost kissed
I wish I could get drunk with the try guys!!!
4:12 lol
Eugene: I would eat Taco Bell drunk [crying softly]
I have never laughed so hard in my life.
I watched this at 2am. and afterwards, went to the kfc website and jus looked at the menu until I fell asleep.
drunk Zach seems so innocent 😇
Are all these guys gay?
This might sound crazy, but I think Keith looks like the crab from Moana.
I want a Eugene.
Everyone knows whataburger is the best drunk spot
Eugene drunkenly crying about Taco Bell is one of the best things that happened in drunk video
i think this is my favourite version on these guys XD
'Don't eat without me you motherfucke-' -Eugene
I've never related more XD
Keith talking about fried chicken is me
Eugene: Peppery?! 
whilst looking insulted
I feel like this video was edited by a drunk person too...
I laughed so hard my face turned red!
PLEASE DO MORE DRUNK TRY GUYS
Now I'm hungry... I'm on an overnight plane flight.
Zach crying about how delicious the food is and Eugene crying when he discovered he loves taco bell is me. Just.... same.
I'm drunk right now and am REALLY JEALOUS!!!!
I need more videos like this in my life xD
The try guys should just be drunk in every video, this is so freaking funny 😂
dude Keith and Zach's giggles omg
KEITH AND FRIED CHICKEN HAS ME IN TEARS
Eugene said "i don't like Taco Bell" WHAT IS WRONG WITH UUUUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but he is still my favorite
Ned is such a cutie!!!

Also watching this when drunk is hilarious heheheh
Oh my god. Ned didn't mention his wife :O
they both come in a box
Church's chicken the best la la la
" you don't know that ?!"   " Yes I do Roalds my neighbour"
Previously on the try guys...
WHICH ONE IS THAT ONE I WANT TO SEE THAT ONE
I can eat a whole pizza drunk by myself I have eaten a whole pizza drunk by myself
GAYyyy
ALL OF THE PAPA JOHNS REFERENCES WERE KILLING MEEEEE😂😂😂😂😂
better sauce, better burgers, papa johns😂😂
Buzzfeed was cool until they went libtard.
I haven't laughed so much in a while. That was the best.
Came from the new video and I correct myself now I've never laughed so hard
i think drunk keith just stops caring and it's beautiful
i'm dying HAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHA
everything eugene at 5:00 HAHAHAHAHA
ya ronald's my neighbor
KFC won because, when your drunk, nothing tastes better than a whole mess of MSG!
Keith was so funny I was dying with laughter                             "Papa Johns"  Keith 2017
la la la
They obviously didn't try spicy Popeyes.  Lefties do everything wrong.
i feel like alcohol just aMpLifiEs zach's adorableness
I love the editing in this video! Also, you guys should get drunk on camera more!
lol LA LA la
"lalala"
Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
Louisiana just got rekt right there
Ned was so fucked up
Who else thinks that the try guys should make slime?
Dorito locos <3
they need to be drunk more😂😂😂
are the try guys gay??
This made me so hungry 😂
A REALLY subtle Papa John's sponsorship
This is HANDS DOWN the best Try Guys video ever
"Well f*ck me and call me an uncle's donkey" -Eugene, 2017
Ned & Keith drunk are so sensual towards each other xD
Wow burgers in America look way bigger and better than the ones in my country
LA LA LA
Eugene would eat Taco Bell and cry while he's drunk, because his brain can't accept the fact that he likes Taco Bell, drunk.
Popeyes > KFC all day everyday
"Don't eat with out me Mother freaker."
"I ate a piece of stray lettuce..."

"You don't know that!"
"Yes I do. Ronald's my neighbor." 

GET EUGENE
 DRUNK MORE HAHAH
this is me everyday! "OMFG THIS IS SO GOOD! FRIED CHICKEN YEAH!"
You do not know the best drunk burger until you have tried whataburger
everything about this video was superb
really annoying people.
The nacho flavor taco is better than cool ranch!
I've never seen a drunk guy eat salad before. 🥗
3:51 literally me when I get drive thru and they don't put any sauce on the side
I would love a night out on the drink with Keith 😂😂😂
Oh my gosh I love them
When i get drunk i cant really taste anything and it pisses me off.
"do we have any sauce" sees there's no sauce confused face "what are we doing!!! what are we doing"  lowers head in shame  "this fight is over we can't beat pizza hut without sauce"😭😭💀💀💀
Eugene was so cute when he tried the Taco Bell 😂😂😂
I'm inclined to believe KFC paid the Try Guys. Their chicken is not better than Popeyes!
oh my god. Zach is so cute.
This honestly made me feel sick watching 😂
The papa johns part killed me lmao
They would be fun to hang out with drunk
Them drunk is actually the best
If you think KFC is better than Popeyes you need to kill yourself.
I feel like they're more than drunk...I feel like they're drunk & high off of something as well..
Would they taste better if you combined them? You can refer to a Shane Dawson video for that lol
I love how they act pretty much the same drunk as when they are normal
ZACH IS SUCH A CUTE LITTLE MAN CHILD OMG I CAN NOT.
Ned : 'I don't see any Dorito's in here?'
Zach : literally genuinely checks the taco
Also Zach : 'wh..what do you mean? The whole thing is the Dorito?'
😂😂
Of course they would think KFC is better than Popeyes
i love the $5 box 💕😱
I love drunk try guys 😂
The Try Guys are funny when they're drunk xD
OMG is Eugene okay?  😂😂😂😂
These aren't tacos, f*ck taco hell
Zack's cute lil' butt!
Lamb donner kebab would beat all of this
One of the best Try Guys videos! Half the time they didn't even make sense 😂😂😂
i would go to fry lord
I've never had tacobell, it's not where I live
holy fuckrooni that was hilarious
Gosh....really needed this video. Thank you Try Guys!
3:50 yessssss
I bet u never guessed papa John was from indiana
Ned's killing it!!
"And if you have enough friends you can eat all of this"
Please! You can just give me my bedroom, doors locked lights off, and some Netflix, that'll all be gone in 5 minutes 😂.
Yesterday I found a piece of hair in my whopper
The two reasons I love this video bc it's funny and drunk Keith And Zack remind me of my best friend deanna and I sober
I don't need "friends" to eat it all, nor do I need to be drunk. I just have to be on my period.
when Keith found out there wasn't sauce 😂😂😂
you can't have taco bell vs pizza hut. it's the same chain! DO-OVER! ;)
The thumbnail looks like Filthy Frank.
Quotes

- Ned
"Thas so good! O my gah! O my gah!"

The Burger King where I live is always trash.
whoever edited this video deserves an award or something
McDonald fries are just addictive
Taco bell is a diarhhea dice roll? Maybe with some loaded dice :D
Faggets
This is the closest that we will see them kissing 😂😂😂
Would it Have hurt to do pizza hut vs dominoes and Taco bell vs del Taco?
Shoulda been Taco Bell vs deltaco
OMG i think this has been my favorite video of buzzfeed by far!! Love the try guys and they are even funnier drunk and eating their favorite foods :D
I can not stop laughing. I also cant believe they haven't had the cool ranch taco.
1:46 papa bless 🙏
Best video I've ever seen.
Something tells me they got sponsored
If they're all willing to get high I'd watch the hell out of this
1:34 McDonald's has better fries? I just lost all respect for you...
They've never had Doritos lokos?
keith is abnormaly attractive to me
Its definitely popeyes.
I love Eugene's reaction to Taco Bell
Burger King, KFC (only in Ky), neither I'd rather have Papa John's.
Let's see them trying out Aquavit!
Keith's face at 2:25
3:50 intern WHAT ARE WE DOING? WHEREW THE SAUCe?
Better burgers... Better fries... Better people... PAPA JOHNS
Guys... there were no mentions of Ned's wife in this video...
"I would not eat this sober" lmaooooooooo
best buzzfeed video ever
it's just me or drunk Eugene is a little gay hahahaha i love it!
More like try too hard guys, amirite?
sodomite vibes
BuzzFeed, the only job where you're required to be drunk...
... D,: WAA ARE WE DOING!!?!
That grease revelation tho xD
Keith's reaction to finding out there was no taco bell hot sauce had me dying 😂
WATCHING THIS FOR THE NTH TIME!! I STILL CAN'T STOP LAUGHING 😂
damn it was hot when they both took a bite of the burger at the same time
incorporate more alcohol into buzzfeed content. More specifically,,,, incorporate more alcohol into keith's body
Love the editing on this video XD it's the best!
I didn't read drunk in the title and I was so confused and laughing thinking what are they on
They are not drunk, they are high, very very high lol.
There is someone who likes fried chicken more than Keith, Onew and Kai....yup
They are all so gay
"That's ludicrous" AWWWW ZACH IS USING BIG WORDS
This is why being drunk can help you find out if you've been cheated on
I wish someone could talk about me the same way Keith talks about Taco bell.
"It's like Olivia Newton John Travolta  all over my hands "
Ok so I need to get drunk to really eat my school food?
watch eugene at 4:21-4:24
Thoughts: Zach is the most adorable drunk ever. Additionally, "Ronald's my neighbor" omg.
I lost is when he said "better sauce better burger papa johns"
😂🤣
EUGENE WAS CRYING OMFG
This is one of my favorites videos!!! XD
KFC
Taco bell same company same good taste
Try Guys when drunk
Keith: Crazy and hilarious 
Zach: Awkward 
Eugene: More talkative than normal
Ned: Hyper (More so than usual)
Sold out.
Zach and Keith are truly hilarious when they're drunk 😂
I wish someone loved me the way these guys love taco bell
This was amazing!!!
1:58 cat in the hat?
3:49 "WHAT ARE WE DOING?"
The try guys should try 'Arnis' 😄💙
How could they not include Jack in the Box?!? That's always my go-to drunk food.
3:51-3:55 KEITH!!! "Whaaaat are we doing? What are we doing?" 😂😂😂😂
KEITH IS A BLESSING! HAHAHAHAHA
It should've been Taco Bell vs jack in the box, and little Cesar's vs Pizza Hut
who realized they switched partners lol
eugene!!!! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When Eugene was so surprised about Taco Bell..  I almost lost it.. and Also.. Keith.. "Lalala" 😂😂😂
this is my favourite episode by far
Some people say 'Bob's your uncle'. Now, I say 'Ronald's my neighbor'. Thx Eugene
your wife is not gonna be happy wi th those bites man😂
Who else is also drunk watching this?
God. Watching this video while you're drunk is great.
Eugene acts like a gay dude when he's drunk lmao
My mom once bought 4 boxes of pizzas for my birthday and the next day, they were all gone. It turns out my cousin came home drunk and ate all of it.
fast good tastes so good f
Keith my dude we need to get drunk together
How didn't Ned knock over that glass at 3:34
The try guys should take a road trip all together in the same car and see how long it takes for them to drive each other crazy and stop at like San Francisco, Portland, Olympia, and Seattle. Then they should hold fan meet and greets. Like if you agree
FUNNIEST TRY GUY VIDEO EVER!
"fc Kfc it was so good my D is gone!"
Drunk Try Guys give me life.
y'all should see how many blazing hot wings the try guys can eat sober then how many they can eat drunk
Well that's great 
Buzz feed made this video with $83 and going to get over $200 from it...
Great job guys
... Also thank you try guys
Popeyes all day
"Yes I do Ronalds my neighbor!"
3:55 💀💀 "what r we doing?!"
"Do we have any sauce?" "No" "WHAT ARE WE DOING?!" Keith-2017

These guys get drunk and eat all day to get payed, Meanwhile I'm here working at these fast food restaurants to afford college.....
The try guys try making diy slime
I wrote a blog post a while ago about why i hate Try Guys, because this is what it does, it appeals to the male fantasy.






kek
"When the Try Guys try to sound clever" is the name of every episode ever.
what the heck?? just when i think eugene cant get any cuter, gets drunk and flushed and starts talking adorably and whispery. Lol also... ned. LOL
LALALA OMG I LOVE ZACHH HOW CAN A HUMAN BE SO ADORABLE AKJSGFSAJKGFLASGFA
Maybe they went to a kfc but i hate kfc that i have here. I rather go to popeyes.
Why does everybody feel like a homo when drunk?
The try guys are the reason buzzfeed is stil a thing...
"la la la" ahaha i can't😂😂😭😂😂
My go to drunk food is a nice Seattle hot dog!
Hot dog, cream cheese, caramelized onions, hot sauce
i feel like some of them faked some of it

I get a whole 12 pack box of doritos locos tacos every time i go to taco bell lol
I hate you so much right now. I just went on a diet.
Pizza is the BEST drunk food no doubt about it
Eugene crying over Taco Bell...
you should try 'tacos al pastor'. Wuuuu! they're the best when you're drunk
Imagine Ned and Keith every time they eat together they do it Lady and the Tramp style
Eugene and zac should get more screen time together
3:49 when your friends don't have the nacho dip...but not the nachos
Do try guy try make street tacos and go to the best street taco joint in la

Was the person that filmed this drunk as well? This is a mess of a video. A+++++
They are so me when im drunk xD
I lose a little respect for anybody who thinks KFC > Popeyes. KFC is BARELY better than Arby's. It can't even begin to touch Popeyes
People guess if it's a dog product or a baby product. Pls make that a thing😂😭
The Try Guys Drunk Fast Food Taste Test... say it 5 times fast -.-

Keith: WE HAVE NO SAUCE.."TRIGGERDD"
KFC"I think they got drunk over chicken 😂
Burger King, KFC, Taco Bell hands down win. Sober OR drunk.
Ned- Better fries. Better burger. Papa Joh- wheezes
Zach- Better quality chicken. Better seasoning... giggles Papa Johns
More of these please god
I swear this promotes people being drunk.
why not do dominoes vs pizza hut or pappa johns? why do tacos vs pizza?
What does kcf mean
I think Eugene become a little more bad boy than normal.

But I also think, Buzzfeed should make more of these (drunk-version) videos
Iol
WHAT ARE WE DOING?-- WHAAAT ARE WE DOING?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA BY FAR MY FAVORITE TRY GUYS VIDEO!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA EVERYONE's SO FUNNY 😂😂
"It's like Olivia Newton John Travolta all over my hands" 😂😂

Has anyone heard the "Combination Pizza Hut & Taco Bell" song? This reminded me of that.
Love drunk Keith and Zach together
Guys, I'm 1:44 into this video and Ned hasn't mentioned his wife or that he's married. This has to be a record
"Just put me in a bathtub full of biscuits."

Ned and Eugene are my spirit animal
Oh I hate KFC and burger king
So the lesson here is KFC is only good if you are completely shitfaced.

I just love the devastated look on Keith's face when he was told they had no sauce for Taco Bell.
One of the guys reminds me so much of Nice Peter from ERB

Hey buzzfeed, you do know deaf people exist? Why does it take you longer to add subtitles to your videos over channels which have less subscribes such as oh whats inside?
IM GONNA SCREAM KEITH IS GOL D

THE LOOK OF UTTER DESPAIR AND SHOCK WHEN HE FINDS THERE IS NO SAUSE FOR HIS COOL RANCH TACO
this is so funny
one of the best guys, so funny
Keith was so funny in this video
'I have fries between my leg' XD
Eugene - inaudiable crying
I believe his brain just blew into tiny shards
I'm at that Pizza Hut! I'm at that Taco Bell! I'm at that combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell!
this is so funny
'What are we doing? What are we doing?' LOL 3:50
I'm starving now
Keith is a beautiful soul that needs to not be reckoned with. XD
Keith and Zach have slowly become my favorite people on the face of the earth
I've never seen a Popeye's or a Taco Bell
These guys definitely fucked each other after the video ended #facts
"it's like Olivia Newton John Travolta all over my hands... wait, their names combine! did they do that on purpose?!"

lol Eugene is my favorite.
SOOO FUNNNY I LOVE THEM OMG😂😂😂😂
It's ok Zach, I want to see that.
I am Eugene at 4:09

https://www.buzzfeed.com/collegemarketers/tell-us-your-favorite-drunk-foods-and-well-guess-2w99k?utm_term=.indarMK5Dy#.uyg9j6W8yk
La la la~ 😂
Olivia Newton John Travolta😂

3:50




Repeat x 15
ME, Myself & I - See, I have enough friends :D Imma eat all!
Zach and Eugene are kind of cute together?
I haven't laughed this much in months.  GREAT JOB!

I love this so much
Am I the only one that thinks Eugene is hot? Yeah.. ok.
Get White Castle next time.

What is Keith saying from 2:27 - 2:33
3:52 i was in tears
im in college, broke af, and watching this is making me want to kill myself
Eugene is hawt cause he is cute anime asian boy and i wanna lick his butt while doing hentai
Eugene is adorable drunk
The try guys should try ariel. (silks, lyra, and hammock.) I'm in ariel and it's a lot harder than it looks. I would be so happy if the try guys decided to challenge themselves to do some tricks. If you guys decide to do this then good luck lol.
Does Eugene seem bigger than the others?  Eugene and Zach make a good couple...
Can you guys try Figure Ice Skating and/or Olympic Gymnastics? That would be great!
I'd rather have the pizza.
Watching drunk people is only funny when you are also drunk. I am not, so this isn't funny.
PAPA BLESS!!
sauce for burger king sucks I love mcdonalds
THE 'LALALA' PART MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD OMG
these guys got PAID to get drunk AND eat fast food. jealous af
Gay af
Zach is adorable
after 4:10 the backg music has me laughing so hard
They should get proper hammered instead of just tipsy. I wouldn't call that drunk.
so like do they drive these men home after this....?
4:55 thanks?!?!
Keith, moment 3:55 THANKS
thanks for the 2min moment Keith
Cold pizza when your drunk is the best.

3:19 "NOOO NOO" IM CRYING I LOVE THEM
I want them to do more of these
3:50 me right there when i don't get hot sauce
McDonalds is vomitous in every way. No meat in their burgers, no dairy product of any kind in their milkshakes, and their fries are limp, tasteless, and usually cold.
It took me longer than 5 minutes to finish the video due to me replaying certain parts gosh dangit😂
Hi everyone, I am currently writing my final research paper for my undergraduate degree and need your help. If you are 18 or older I would love for you to take my survey. It's anonymous so no need to worry about how you answer! Thanks so much! Its about how willingness to communicate and intercultural relationships are related.

https://utk.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6SyLfeEXWutby9n
I'm surprised Ned didn't mention his wife in this video
I wish Australia had taco bell
Next: The Try Guys High Food Taste Test!!!
i am drunk keith
I literally choked on water when Eugene started 'crying'
Eugene you won't like Taco Bell when you are sober.
And this is why every person who works for buzzfeed isn't human
At 3:51 
Is my fav part btw but what's the song in the background I want to know what song or thingy that is
When keith gets so upset over no sauce with rhe tacos LOL
i love this
the Papa John's part got me 😂😂😂
um?????
This was exhausting but beautiful
😂😂😂💕
I haven't had tacos for like 2 years now
Do we have any sauce? (no) WHAT ARE WE DOING !! 😂 so damn relatable
KFC VS Popeyes??? How the hell do you pick KFC...
shouldn't it be pizza hut and dominos o.O
#papabless

gay people pretending to be drunk
This is literally one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I was DYING the whole time.
This made me laugh so hard
they are AWESOME when they are drunk!!
Oh my goh
this is the best try guys video, or close to the best
I swear to god buzzfeed why are you so annoyingly entertaining? I mean like they're videos are so simple they have like no content to them its just reaction videos
this isn't papa johns!! it's pizza hut!
They should come to buffalo and try mighty taco vs taco bell
If you have enough friends you Can have all of these
lalala
Pizza hut or Taco Bell is one of the toughest questions, Not only are they completely different, They're two of my most favorite fast food joints.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I CANT STOP LAUGHING OH GOSH
I'm actually so hungry rn
KFC will never be better than Popeyes. EVER.
mad mad motherf&ckers. God Save the World.
BABY WHEN I TELL YOU POPEYES GON BLESS YO SOUL THESE BISCUITS AAAAAAAA
If I filmed anything while being drunk I would have to put every friend's phone on fire let alone put it on internet.
Pizza Hut vs Dominoes 
Taco Bell vs Del Taco 
Makes more sense to me at least
best buzzfeed video I've ever watched
You know they're drunk when they start saying KFC chicken is good
KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut all owned by the same company lol
i know buzzfeed cant respond to any comments but i think you guys should make a video of drunk people getting massages or do a worth it video of it please
I didn't mind seeing Zach's tush! (I do not need to see more but it was cute!)
Jack in the box tacos r the best
Forever my favorite try guys video
They need to come to ACTUAL Kentucky and taste kfc
drunk Keith and Zach are sooooo adorable
Can't relate
Honestly this is me sober
KFC is awful. It needs to be Popeye's vs. Church's.
I wanted to see that, Zack
they just had to pit my favorite pizza place ever and my fave fast food place ever, taco bell and pizza hut, I wouldn't be able to choose!!!
I too did not realize how pickle heavy a Big Mac is until I was drunk
eugene turns into keith when he's drunk
I AM KEITH IN FRIED CHICKEN OMG 😂😂😂😂 I AM EVERYONE IN FRIED CHICKEN
Try guys read hate comments pls x
why does Ned sound like Yoda and Kermit the frog combined
even a drunk person knows thats bad hahahahaha
From all the fast food, which one was the best?

Papa John's. la, la, la.
😂
The Try Guys drunk gives me life.
Papa bless
I love Drunk Eugene
You guys need to actually put Taco Bell up to Taco John's. I believe they're only here in the Midwest but they are sooooooooooo much better omfg. Delish!
I work at Kfc and the fact that they all liked the seasoning makes my heart sing.LALALALALAAALA. lol
I love them drunk
Ok why does ned look like my psychiatrist i swear hes living a double life
jack in the box taco >>> taco bell taco
2:07-2:08 lmaooo Zach was possessed by the Lumpy Space Princes
i do this taste test every saturday night...for...research
Ned is killin' me.
I want to hang out with drunk Eugene and Keith
How the hell did they get Eugene drunk..?
KFC IS THE BEST
Great food video
Wendy's for burgers McDonalds for fries and Coke and burger king for air. xD Taco bell over pizza hut and KFC for life over Popeye's!
They are amazing when they're drunk
I LOVE THE TRY GUYS EVEN MORE WHEN THEY'RE DRUNK OMG
Eugene turned Ned's friendship down (tear)
This video got me so offended in so many ways 😂😂😂
This video was NOT made for vegetarians.
Nah man Popeyes is better than KFC
I refuse to eat the burgurs at the Burger King in my area because you can actually smell the pot on them
drunk try guys are the best try guys😂😂😂 especially drunk keith😂😂😂
If you have not had Louisiana Popeyes it's so much better than KFC.
Olivia Newton John Travolta. I died.
"No no it's not!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
have the next drunk video be a my little pony reaction. not the theme song because that is the worst of it. but find funny some funny clips and show it to them
I never knew how much I needed the 'la la las' that Keith and Zach kept singing in my life until this very moment
Keith is so sweet😍😚
DRUNK EUGENE IS MY FAVORITE PERSON OML
it was so funny
Ughhh this made me so hungryyyyy
LAAA la la
Keith went full Seinfeld. "WHAT'RE WE DOING?!"
omg 😂😂😂
LALALALALA KEITHHHH
"Everything about this taco is amazing, it's amazing"
"I can eat a whole pizza drink by myself. I HAVE eaten a whole pizza drink by myself." -Eugene
lol Keith make me laughed lol when he is drunk lol 😂
This is the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in my life!
the try guys are so so so funny drunk lmao
Is it me or does it seem like the try guys are 'acting' drunk as a posed to actually BEING drunk?
3:48 I died!😂😂
screw Burger King 
they sell dodgy wraps and give you expired coupons 

McDonald's for the win definitely
Omg Keith Lmao.
God dammit I knew this video was going to make me hungry😂
Taco Bell is still great even when I'm sober ngl
la la la
Frame boiloiled
in what world is KFC Better? drunken fucktards
Too bad the video department of Buzzfeed is in LA because here in Texas, everyone knows when its 2-3 AM everyone is at Whataburger for their Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit Sandwich and Spicy Ketchup.
Why does buzzfeed always post doing something drunk videos. Can they not think of any new ideas?
lol pizza hut and taco bell are owned by the same company, no wonder its so hard lol
I was dying at the very beginning: "Don't eat without me motherf*#%*!".
The true drunk food taste test is between jimmy johns and firehouse subs
tacobell without sauce is a sad taco
They're too extra. Fuckin cringe .
By far the best video Buzzfeed has ever uploaded.
Y'all should of try street taco. Taco Bell is fake
Popeyes the best chicken spot.
0:43 lets see how we can turn a drunk food debate into something political #BuzzFeedGoingOutOfBusinessSale
"KFC LA LA LA " i'm crying holy water right now that was hilarious
Clearly alcoholic Eugene is not on the same level as the others. Should have pre-gamed Eugene. Rookie mistake
Buzzfeed has never made me cry laugh before
try guys try white castles
This was a bit of an overreaction
the try guys try stoner food drunk
Ronald's my neighbour .😂😂😂
I was honestly hoping someone would say their favorite was Papa J's at the end. hahaha
There's no point in eating taco bell if there's no sauce.
I dont think this was a fair test.... they didn't try Whataburger!
lately kfc has been good.Kinda better than popeyes
DRUNK KEITH IS SO FUNNY OML
Next video should be "Try Guys see a nutritionist!" LMAO
Drunk Zach is so cute
Put me in a bathtub full of biscuits- Keith 2k17
OOH!.... Its grilled.
I think papa johns clearly is the winner here
they're gay af
they are so perfect
KFC taco bell and pizza hut are owned by Yum! Brand
This is definitely one of the best try guys videos there is I'm laughing so hard
this video is beautiful, what an amazing display of friendship
do you market your videos exclusively to americans? because, europeans just skip over the ads. 
come on buzzfeed, make it worth our while.
"No one wants to see that Zach" whilst staring intensely...😂
I'm afraid I'll be like Eugene and end up liking Taco Bell drunk.
4:04 "I don't see the doritos in here " 😂😂😂
KFCCCCCC!!!! In SA is literally one of the biggest franchises. I'm scared to admit my love for it, like sometimes I only eat the seasoning and not the actual chicken.
After years of personal research the best food while drunk is.... waffle house
Hey, where's the jollibee at? don't know if you guys have been there before but their foods is so good.
Texans get whataburger when drunk. It's pretty amazing.
Fast food always tastes better when you are drunk or high.
Why am I the same not being drunk?
Not gonna lie, watching Ned and Keith share that burger was kinda hot!
They made me feel drunk LOL
2:44 bro
zachs laugh is so cute ; v ;
eugene cried?? same
now the try guys have a drunken orgy in all the left over fast food. crying.........
Can they just do stand up comedy for a day. But while they are drunk. Cause this is f*ckin hilarious. 😂
Keith is hillarious
"the burgers are better at hungry jacks" says the Australian
the papa John's jokes had me dying XD
Taco bell.... Taco hell.  Pizza hut...... Pizza but
I didn't think I could love these guys more BUT NOW I DO ❤️
Whopper King Place... They should actually use that name :P
I love the try guys
lol i dont know if they made it on purpuse but the audio and the vid are not on sync
I wanna get paid to be drunk AND EAT FOOD OMG I NEED TO RE-EVALUATE MY LIFE!
you can tell keth's brain exploded when there was no sauce😂 3:49
Keith did 2 fried chicken taste test. What was that reaction for?
I wanted that Zach.
BEST TRY GUY VIDEO YET!!
Try guys doing an escape room. Please please please. thumb up if you want it to Happen
KFC over Popeyes any day
The words Try Guys and Drunk in the sentence is something delicious. WAIT WHAT?
<3
I miss the old McDonald's fries.
"Burger King's a burger king, not a fry lord."
I wish you guys could come down to the South and try Bojangles. It's a regional fried chicken chain. It's WAY better than both KFC and Popeyes, imo. Great video!!
how am i the only one who thinks the try guys are so obnoxious now..... it's like they're all trying to be louder than eachtother.
Well y'all prob didn't get spicy at Popeyes soooo......
But like Whataburger though...
i cant stop laughing at drunk Keith
Beef and cheese
sooo where's jack in the box??
KFC is crap. It taste so good and you want more because those 11 herbs and spices are salt, pepper, and MSG. Taco bell too.
anyone noticed zach's wink at 3:11
I can't stop laughing
Drunk Zach is so cute omg
Am I the only one who thinks they sound like teletubbies when they sing for kfc?
His mouth is just so big. Is there a video of Keith putting his fist in his mouth? Or perhaps a grapefruit?
THIS VIDEO IS SOFT AND NEAT
Amazing, iconic
The try guys: sperm cell taste test
You can't call pizza hut pizza "pizza"...that's insanity. That's like buying Tyson chicken and calling it "fried chicken"...just no!
I need a gif of 4:22 - 4:24 stat.
Ewww I hate KFC. 🤢
You know what, Zac? We want to see you shave your chest.
Did Ned say "Put me in a bathtub full of biscuits?"
They were all extra cute in this video
why do I feel like there not drunk
"Taco Bell was the only restaurant to survive the franchise war... Now all restaurants are Taco Bell."
They've gotta have a Harvey's burger. Best fast food burgs ever
But Taco Bell food is simply a conduit for the sauce packets...
they're so cute weird when they are drunk
1:50 😂
i wanna see that 😂
Just so you know Eugene, I've eaten a whole pizza sober 😈😈😈
That one song that two guys did at a camp talent show a few years ago that's like:
I'm at that Pizza Hut
I'm at that Taco Bell
I'm at that coooombination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell
this is legitimately the funniest video i have ever seen
how does KFC beat popeyes tho??
Keith turned into Jerry Seinfeld at 4min
I'm fasting... this is a nightmare for me.
5:07 guess I can't drink... no friends...
Getting drunk with these guys sounds like the worst possible night of drinking
lalala lalala I am lorde 2:42
"I know this one's gonna give me diarrhea, this ones a dice roll"
Story of my life
I've never seen Eugene actually ACT drunk like this before, usually its a billion drinks still calm and collected
it is realy cool
papa does not bless
generally compromise crack lens regularly photograph chest.
Someone drive Keith to a public and give him their fried chicken. It's THE BEST
I'm one of the ''people who want to see that''
the editing is amazing 😂😂😂
I hate 🐔
"Better sauce.. better burger.. papa johns"
"Call me an uncles donkey"
"This fight is over we can't eat pizza hut without sauce!"
This is by far my favorite try guys video, I'm dying over here xD
Real talk, if there was a place where I could get BK's whopper and McDonald's fries, that would be the best place on earth
Zach is an adorable drunk lol #justsaying
I wonder how American KFC taste like
"Ur killin it ned" 😂
Keith is so funny HAHAHA
3:52 - 3:56 Keith is SAME 😋
zach drunk is SO CUTE 😊
So much gayness
I'M LAUGHING SOOOO HARD AT HOW EUGENE'S SO SHOCKED ABOUT GOING FOR TACO BELL 😂😂😂
4:55 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"It's Olivia Newton John travolta all over my hands" baha hahahah legit dying 😂😂😂and hands down best try guys video
now i want Taco bell...
"Ronald's my neighbor" 😂
this was THE best buzzfeed  video I've ever seen
Jew
soft and neat soft and neat soft and neat s o f t a n d n e a t SOFT AND NEAT SOFT AND NEAT S O F T A N D N E A T
"we can't beat pizza hut without sauce" LOL ME
it isn't Louisiana fast.it's lou-siana
KEITH IS SO FUNNY! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH KEITH!!
Because of the end, I'm not even sure if Zach was that drunk lol. But he's just so goofy he probably doesn't need to drink
Dilated pupils everywhere.
"LOUISIANA FAST!" "la la la!"
soft and neat
Ned is the worst drunk. Lol.
What-a-burger is bomb to get drunk. :)
i would love to see a version where they do this but stoned out of their minds
Dude nahhhhh Popeyes all day
no no no no
How we know it was an April Fools prank: Ned didn't mention his wife.
The whole time I was watching this all I could hear was "Combination Pizza Hut & Taco Bell" by Das Racist.
I work at Arby's, and I was kinda hoping they'd be part of this hot mess...
EUGENE GOT VISIBLY DRUNK
these people must of never had SOUTHERN CLASSIC if they think kfc is great. Who knows the truth
Drunk Ned is so giggly, cute lol
omg Eugene drunk crying is the best
Olivia Newton John Travolta...that's it, we're done here!
Drunk people are the best 😂😂
They made so many papa johns jokes I was disappointed when they didn't get papa johns
Eugene's John Travolta ref made me smile because I literally saw him in person last night.
I'm actually dying this is so funny
Just going to throw it out there that Popeyes restaurants in Louisiana are bomb. Popeyes restaurants not in Louisiana are not near as good. I've grown up eating Popeyes in Louisiana on the regular, and ones out of state don't season their food like we do in Louisiana.
it's all about Mary Brown's chicken in Canada mmmm
0:19 "some people want to see that",zach are you drunk already?
And now im hungry 😋
Best drunk food ever?  WHITE CASTLE!
Soft and neat
i died when they kept on doing the better __ better __ better people papa johns 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Their too drunk
Please make this video but with lunchables
zach is getting cuter...... sorry for thinking that you were the least cute try guy back in the past
hahaha so good!
"the ham-ham burger at the whopper king"
Eugene: Out of everything we tried today, what is the best-
Keith: KFC! There I said it
4:46


omg I can watch that part a billion times
Hail Corporate
I love that they switched the teams around, they all interact so well with each other so it's always hilarious!
OMG I need to see more of drunk Eugene
More drunk try guys
GOD this made me hungry
This video is my new favorite thing!
Keith is me when it comes to Taco Bell sauce. I get so pissed when I have to eat their tacos without sauce.
don't eat without me mothefucker! -Eugene 2017
I don't know if it's just me but Keith reminds me of the crab from Moana
Mcdonalds big tasty and Burger king big whopper are my fav with the fries to and rink :3
wtf =/ buzzfeed
"Yeah Ronald's my neighbor"
"Is there any sauce?" 
'No'
"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!??!"
The Doritos taco is so good
Yes Zach, there were people who wanted to see that
This is sooooooo hilarious omL
Keith is my spirit animal. 😂
crispy chicken and shrimp with extra gravy saucccceee
KFC is better than Popeyes!?  BLASPHEMY!! 🔪😡
I love Eugene's reaction to Taco Bell
Best one since they did drag.
I would pick taco bell 😂😂
I hate fried chicken
Yes, submit to our KFC Chicken, SUBMIT!
I prefer Popeyes only because all of there other stuff they serve
What are we doing?!!
pineapple does go on pizza there I said it
Personally speaking the best drunk food of all time for me will always be Whataburger <3
OMG 1:55 I'm crying
This is by far funniest try guys video please come up with more things for try guys to do drunk lol.
"Whats this taste test about?" LMAOOOOO
Popeyes is wayyyyy better
I'm dying!😂😂😂😂 Eugene is so ashamed for liking taco bell. and then Keith is just like chicken! and Zack is like everything is beautiful!
I wanna work at BuzzFeed😩🙌🏼
drunk eugene is just less serious eugene
I don't think they're really drunk in this vid they're faking it
Try Guys high junk food taste test!!!!!
I think they need to do this test again but stoned instead of drunk. Honestly Taco Bell was like my "go to" place when I was younger and stoned but man now I wouldn't mind some KFC! LOL! Btw Try Guys, I love you guys! You make my bad days good again ^_^
They completely disrespected Popeyes
Eugenes drunk reaction😅😂😂
This video confused me SO MUCH
Taco Bell made re-think their whole existence
They are extremely endearing when dunk
Pizza Hut is nasty😷😷
The try guys drunk is my aesthetic
SOFT AND NEaT
OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN TRAVOLTA

All my ALL TIME favorites people on BuzzFeed keep leaving. I'm PRAYING that the Try Guys don't leave for greener pastures. They are just so great together.
Eugene just blew everyone's mind with Olivia newton john Travolta
"yeah i do, ronald's my neighbour" LOGGING OUT OF LIFE GOODBYE AHHAHAHAHAHA
I wanna see Zach's butt, thank you
0:20 TRUE
LOL THESE DUDES ARE GAY
where is this previous episode where they get drunk
A job where you can get drunk and eat fast food..... sounds wonderful
"Even a duck person knows that's and" 😂😂
So... Wikipedia says, Buzzfeed only makes about 170 million a year. Considering how much fckn youtube content on different channels they have, plus their website and google search results, they probably make 170 million a month. Fckn wikipedia lies...
When I get drunk I usually gorge on vegan frozen pizza
This makes me so happy
im british so ive only had popeyes once when i went to america nd it was bloody disappointing why do they serve scones with chicken what is with that
ken-tuck-ayay
Bojangles has the best fried chicken and fries case closed
Why did I think that they were going to drink the fast food as in it would have been blended into a drink...
omg too funny!!!!
is the korean guy gay?
I'm fortunate to live in the NY/NJ area so I can order great pizza that's not made from Pizza Primitive Shelter, Red and Blue Game Tile with White Dots Pizza, Diminutive Roman Ruler Pizza or Pizza Made by a Father Named John.
Yall gotta try the pirata taco from taco palenque. idk if you have something like that in Cal, but over here in Laredo its everyone's favorite drunk food.
soft and neat.
Uncle john
Lol I'm not trusting white people to tell me which chicken is better, especially when they're "drunk"
La la la
This is the best video the try guys have ever done
Ned didn't mention his wife? Oh right, it's april fools.
Dont eat that gay
is it just me or do they seem more gay if they are drunk
Zach is always so cute!!
fast food greasy taco i love
The religious experience that Keith has at 2:25 is killing me
3:51      WHAT ARE WE DOING
Now, I want KFC.
KFC la la la
Make a quiz for what try guy are you
Lol
These mfs just said KFC is better than Popeyes. Wtf
How about you pull an April Fools joke that requires the ENTIRE TEAM OF BUZZFEED coming back.

Then leave.
and if you have enough friends.. you can eat all of this! XDDD
i really like the editing
the ship sails itself
i laughed so hard i cried a little
3:52 ... dying
I didn't know I needed this video until now!!
Taco bell who? Can't get it in nz :(
Everything about this video is wild and I love it
me me big boy
Popeye's chicken got no votes but I miss it so much!!!! 

I moved to a place that does not have Popeye's and KFC just isn't doing it for me. Haha 

If I won the lottery as a way to sustain my new wealth I'd call up there corporate part and setup the franchise over here! 

But I'm not that rich and on a good month I don't touch into my overdraft.....
Now I'm craving for Whooper burger.. Thank Buzzfeed..
it was a bad decision. even a drunk person knows thats wrong😂😂😂😂😂😂
More of these 😂
living for them drunk
This was hilarious 😂
I wouldn't mind if the channel went broke and you all became unemployed.
"the burger hamburger at the whopper king place"
Kfc la la la😂
Drunk Ned is even more amazing 😂😂💯
I imagine they recorded this after their night out wearing heels 👠 🍻 🍔 🍟
cringe
When he said my d*ck is gone I lost it!!!!
I was dying the whole time lol someone please do one of Asian food with them drunk lol
I am Eugene when I'm drunk!
I'm a vegetarian but I went to an anime convention in February and while I was dressed as Sailor Moon at midnight I ordered three Burger King meals and chicken fries and ate it all and it was the best
Keith acts the most drunk
"What Fankstien sh*t is this?!" Best Eugene qoute ever! 😂😂😂😂
The way Zach is like "Look how... immaculate the top is!" Is just so cute idk why though😂
I really need pizza.
I'm crying about the Olivia newton john travolta 😂
Zach : "Look at it, it's so immaculate..... It's so beautiful ~~!!!"
The cap guy's face is twice as big as the glass guy's face.
Thanks for putting back the Try Guys on here and not only youtube red !

Ps : don't get why Zach is still single bc he's adorable !
Try Norwegian food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
are they men?
I love it when they're drunk
This is the best video on the internet.
Eugene is unpleasant
Only white people like KFC. Ps im not racist
Why did they switch them when they were trying pizza vs taco I got fucked I thought I had traveled into a parallel universe
TRY GUYS TRY BALLET
soft and neat
Was this meant be a April Fools video because if it was I don't get it?
They are all so genuinely funny hehhehe
I love the part 1:59
idk why but i have this weird crush on Zach
I seriously love the try guys, they're my favorites 😂😂
literally they edited this drunk too 😂😂❤❤
SOFT AND NEAT
Starting to find the 'try guys' annoying
Two grown men should never take a bite of the same piece of food at the same time.never
AND IM SO KEATH(or how the hell his name is spelled)
IM LAUCHING SO FREAKING HARD
PLEASE MORE DRUNK TRY GUYS
AHHAHAHAHAHAHA
So many good one liners!
soft and neattt
There is no way Eugene would be drunk off just the drinks they tried during their sexy drinks video. They have proven that in past videos. I hope this is a prank. 

So I'm holding out hope that another try guys video is coming on schedule later. I'm having squad wars withdrawals.
this is hilarious 😂😂😂
It's cool that they got gay couples to do this. I don't roll that way but I support the diversity.
This is my new religion.
WHITE CASTLE is thee BEST fast food when you're drunk or high #haroldandkumar 😂
Their drunk. Go hoME
I don't care if this is April fools it's still hilarious
IM AT THE PIZZA HUT!

IM AT THE TACO BELL!

IM AT THE COMBINATION PIZZA HUT & TACO BELL!!!
Keith's face at 3:51 . 😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂😂😄😁😆🤣😂🤣and at 4:53
This was incredible and hysterical lmao
We need to start a partition to bring taco bell to Australia.
But why they switched at the end x') ?
Keith: What are we doing?!?!?!
There's no sauce
Gordan Ramsey: WHERES THE LAMB SAUCE!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The thumbnail made me think it was a white filthyfrank
Keith is hilarious drunk :)))))))))))
i just cant get oVER HOW EUGENE WAS SO FUCKIN' HAPPY ABOUT THE WHOLE "WIAT DID THEY DO THAT ON PURPOSE!!???" THING I CANT IM CRYING SEND HELP PLZ
Soft and Neat.
I'm hungry...
this was the best video literally ever.
ned: "better sauce, better burger..." breaks down laughing
keith: "better people; papa john's! NEXT!!!1!1"
I COULDNT STOP LAUGING OMG!!!
😂😂😂
how you gonna do a drunk test without jack in the crack? :/
Eugene is just getting over dramatic now. Keith and the dude with him are more fun to watch.
Lmao drunk Ned is me when I'm drunk. I don't know why but I laugh so much when I'm drunk 😂
KFC la la la (laughs at same time and tune)
taco bell is my sweet summer child
so fake
I need to get off the internet for a day..
S o fT
aN   D
NE  a T
IN THE UNIVERSE 😂
I died when Ned said "better sauce, better burger-" and Keith comes in "papa johns"
3:51 when someone says Justin bieber is gay
"Ronald it's my neighbor" and the Olivia Newton John and John Travolta jokes.  I laughed like an idiot
If only all the videos buzz feed make were a joke
when Eugene started crying 😂 lmao
yes! Drunk Try Guys. 
but I honestly need subtitles  for this one. (I have to rewatch several parts to know WTF someone said,  especially Eugene)
lmfao
The fact that they kept switching places really fucked me up.
Getting paid to drink at work mmmm
"He's a Burger King, not a Fry Lord"
OMG Drunk Ned! There needs to be more drunk Ned!
drunk or not this was funny
This is the funniest video these guys have ever done.
XD
i aspire to be this drunk with my friends.
watching this drunk made this better than usual
Also "Olivia Newton John Travolta" was the best.
mcdonalds is the best.. but with a drink kfc rulessss
Oh my gosh, this was amazing. One of their best videos. (And let's be real, I love all their videos tremendously.)
Keith and Ned are like kids who've had too much sugar
I love this video!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
These are the whitest bitches i've ever seen.
Title should be Drunk Gay Guys Eat Fast Food
I don't care how much people hate on Taco Bell. It's better tasty than most fast food places and like 50% of restaurants. Plus, it's usually healthier as well.

Taco Bell wins every time.

You don't have to be drunk. It's always good
"i never realized big macs were so pickley until i been drunk"
ugh...pile of fannies this lot
la la la
' why choose one when you can have it all?' 
because im broke af
What legends!
popeyes is a god compared to kfc.
"Put me in a bath tub full of biscuits"
Kfc in my country taste like sheer nothingness
I am living for Ned in this video
i feel like eugene is my drunk fast food soul mate hahaha this is how i am with food
I want to get drunk just to eat kfc.  they looked like they went on a drug trip as they ate it
They can not find a man who is not gay HAHAHAHA
Zack: Do you think Ronald McDonald paints his whole body?
Eugene: No, no, it's just the face
Zack: You don't know that
Eugene: Yes I do
Zack: You don't know that
Eugene: Yeah, Ronald's my neighbor

End of discussion
Next time I get drunk, I will get Designated Dave to buy all the foods :P
Hahahahaha
4:54 how can something be gone that never existed?
I love this video 😂😂
I think feminism is a good thing and all, but there really needs to a established line of masculinity.
now i want to be drunk to enjoy chicken as much as they did
Always do a drunk video, especially with Ned, because... trouth moubles
Keith's face they said that they didn't have sauce had me dying.
ok, uncles donkey
"Even a drunk person knows that's bad" hahaha
I am simple girl, I see 'Try Guys' and 'Drunk', I click.
I don't like the fries at mcdonalds... am I the only one?
Whataburger is the absolute best drunk food bro.
Ronald's my neighbour...
"drunk"
i need the stoner version.
Yeah they're drunk alright.
Olivia Newton John- John Travolta haha. Did they do that on purpose? haha
Obviously Papa Johns was the winner!
its a burger king, not a fry lord
I'm just like this without alcohol
Why not domino?
This made me hungry
congratulation! you have unlocked an achievement BuzzFeed: make me feel hungry and disgusted at the same time

here is a cookie
Keith at 3:51 is me, every time I forget the sauce
keith reminds me of Coralines dad
buzzfead: THE MORE YELLING AND VIDEO CUTS THE DRUNKER THE AUDIENCE WILL THINK THEY ARE
This is probably one of the best videos buzzfeed has done
i never realized that they got this plastered in the last video! XDD
The US burgers are huge compared to the ones in England!
they're definitely sober lol
How drunk are they?!
what was the video at the beginning
Sponsored by YUM! (Pizza hut, Taco Bell and KFC)
They should have had Popeyes spicy chicken instead of the original it's much better.
That was that expensive? Damn
WHAT IN THE DRUNK TRY GUYS. Popeyes is where its at yall. Get it TO GET HER LOL
This is amazing
Keith!!!!!
They are really bad actors of trying to act drunk
In case you saw this video without the comment:
S o F t   A n D   n E a T
i can't drink.
yet.
I AM LAUGHING SO MUCH
why the f is this entertaining?
I call for a recall add jack tacos and Whataburger 🤘
Their all homo Fasho
This is probs an april fools joke but damn i still laughed.
Yet when I'm drunk the only thing I'm taste testing in more vodka...
Thank you...for this amazing video xD
Seems like they are just acting drunk, to be honest. Like when you bring someone really lame to a party and they try to fit in. Kind of annoying... 😐
they should do a follow up video & see if the have the same response
I'm so glad we're back to Try Guys videos that feel more like the originals! God I love these men!
Eugene: Ronald's my neighbor!
"even a drunk person knows that's bad" HAHAHA
Like these fuckers aren't fake and hyper enough WITHOUT alcohol smh
"its a burger king not a fry lord" only keith lmao
They should do every video drunk this is amazing
Am I the only one who gets cancer every time buzzfeed comes out with another video?
This is the best Try Guys video in a while! Eugene talking about Taco Bell is hilarious!!
Olivia Newton John Travolta 😂
We know what these guys look like almost naked
56 billion animals are tortured raped and slaughtered every year of every hour of every minute of everyday please leave animals off your plate go vegan
I hate fried chicken
east of Chicago barbeque chicken pineapple pizza is the best!
damn i watch hella buzzfeed videos but I've never noticed how effeminate these dudes are
Why yall get the nastiest chicken. Churches got they spicy chicken and they honey biscuits be bomb.
Oh wow, even Ned's hair is drunk. Also, Jack in the Box tacos for drunk food. Or a Whataburger #1 meal with a chocolate shake.
best fastfood fried chicken? hmmmmm JOLLYBEES BY FAR IS THE BEST FUCKIN A GODDAMN THE MEAT TO FAT RATIO IS IMPPECIBALE TRY ITT!!
bessst video ever
la la la
"I lost my di@k"  why not say 
"I lost my anus"
Drunk ppl would never think they are drunk, if you do then you're not drunk enough :)
kieth is proof that all black people don't like fried chicken
This shoulda been called the try guys get sexual...#gaystyle
The tacos part did it xD
food like this could only come from above...
I love how Eugene cried when he choose taco bell
Taco  Bell is stoner food. How do I support my claim? I'm a drive thru cashier at Taco Bell and I work night shift. How many stoners do you think I get every single night?
"I could eat a whole pizza drunk by myself. I mean I HAVE eaten whole pizzas drunk by myself."
REACT TO MAKE IT POP
I understand what's going on but I though they were gonna drink the food by what the title says. 😆😅
Is it just me or does it seem like they are just pretending to be drunk.
these 4 lesbians are annoying
I though Eugene wasn't physically able to get drunk 😂😂😂 they've must've given him lots of alcohol
Drunk Keith is sober me about chicken
So this may be the gayest video on youtube, hands down.
do the same but do stoner food
make Keith a meme
KFC is by far better, but I'm also a big fan of Popeyes. It's all about the mood I'm in really. They can co-exist lol
Hah gaaaaayy
They're so fake
Poppa John had me
Drunk Keith is now my spirit animal
i think drunk try guys have all the answers of my life problems.
The are called "Burger King" for a reason.. McDonalds is falling off.. and the one thing they had that was good was their chicken sandwiches. Unfortunately, it doesn't even taste anything like chicken. Not sure what it is. That goes for both chains. Pretty much any food chain that uses real chicken will have a chance of beating these two giants. Chic-fil-A is a great example.
"don't eat without me motherf*vker!" literally me everytime because I'm the last one to get out of my room 😂😂
When they have employees to get drunk for videos, what do they do after? Do they have the employees to go home? Have them to take a nap? Get back to work? My questions are endless.
I love them drunk 😂
4:03 "it's not a taco, it's a TacoBeeeell", wisest of them all
Eugine is gooooood lookin 😍
2:11 lmao that's so me when i'm drunk
I love Zach's little giggle omggg
McDonald's. KFC. Pizza Hut. 100%.
Yall do realize they arent actually drunk right? lol
whataburger, hands down. like..? hello? C:
I need some Pizza Hut pizza now
It sucks that The Try Guys are apart of BuzzFeed. They're funny and entertaining....BuzzFeed in general, not so much.
Drunk Keith makes my entire life worthwhile 😂
this is blinking HILARIOUS
Keith and Ned eating the burger together was very sensual, intimate.
waffle house best drunk food ever!!
what does try guys mean?
Eugene and I are the same when drunk and hungry. EUGENE! Eventually you will want Tbell while sober! It's a SLIPPERY SLOPE.
I cant stop laughing 😂
They're such a bad influence when drunk. They all turn into children x'D
im starving
when ppl are drunk they get loud
when you Jaden Edson everyone loves fried chicken I said no they don't I hate Frederick cuz I actually do hate fry chicken
These guys spend half their  time naked and the other half drunk
im truely disappointed that you chose mcdonald's fry over burger king. Burger King. BURGER. FUCKIN. KING.!!! :(
The Try Guys try horse back riding (you could make it a series by learning how to train and take care of your horse, though for the training stage you'd need a different horse then the other stages probably because you don't want to be riding a green horse) and you should do it in both disciplines (western and english) and maybe even compete each other in a few events (barrel racing, hunter jumping, etc) :) Absolutely LOVE you guys <3
i love this video so much. sO mUcH
Where's the taco sauceeeee!!!( Gordon Ramsay voice)
They are the cutest drunk men I've ever seen.
I kinda ship Zach and Eugene hahahah
I didn't know they were doing drunk Lorde covers in this vid
keith lmfaooooooo
this is just too hilarious
I'm from Louisiana and I've never had Popeyes bc of a pooping incident a family member had after eating it once😂😂
Why is their entire cast gay?
The gayness bro
Am I the only one that wants to see them do this again, only sober?
When BuzzFeed gets sponsored from all the fast food chains in this video.
I agree, Keith. WHERE'S THE SAUCE?
Taco Bell is the best drunk food hands down. But with tons of fire sauce
"The fries at McDonald's are better, but the burger hamburger at the whopper king..." XD
?
That moment when you see Eugene vulnerable and emotional... about tacos
next try korean fried chicken!!!!!
Drunk Zack is so precious
Wow,  Keith's so red hahhha
why he dont have sauce 

omg 
omg
Come to Texas, get drunk, eat whataburger.
fake drunks
zach,  I wanna marry you.
Eugene, I wanna marry you too.
MOAR DRUNK TASTE TESTS WITH THE TRY GUYS PLZ
Ronald's my neighbor😂
Try hard guys.... the guys from worth it are funnier
Cringe
This video far exceeded my expectations.
KFC is flavorless
taco bell is the best drunk/hangover food
the moment when Keith freaks out that there is no taco bell sauce. i was laughing so loudly.
they are not drunk
Papa johns😂😂😂😂
I love them even more when they're drunk
Oh my god I missed the try guys. Zach I love you.
kfc is literally satans spawn popeyes is 10000000000 times better
Eugene is a mean drunk.
😂😂😂 your wife ned say it 😬
haven't they made this video like 3 times already?
And I thought I was annoying when I'm drunk
keith is my favourite
This is why aliens don't want to talk with us
NEVER! trust an edited comment
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eugene seems like a diva when drunk.
eugene and zach are my new fave duo
Real drunk people would not be able to pronounce big words like ludicrous
The Try Hards
Keith and Zac are gay
i died laughing😂😂
Hello random comment surfer I hope you have a wonderful day!





APRIL FOOLS! 😈😈🎉
Seriously tho have a blessed day!
Best one lol
A bunch of dorks I would NEVER hang out with...ever!!!
its 4:30am and im drunk watching this
I'm with Eugene, taco bell wins all. I know, I don't get it either
when drunk
need and kieth  are the only ones that don't act like they do when they are sober
3:51 Keith sounds like Jerry Seinfeld
Ned aerial is the nicest girl in the world
Do "The High Try Guys Try:"
we need more drunk try guys
4:49-4:55
You guys all got pranked! Its april fools
"No one wants to see that" i want to see it, Zach is adorable
man this made me laugh. do more of these. lol
Does anyone else think that they edited this drunk, too???
Hahahah
Well butter my buns and call me a biscuit
I. love. all. of. you.
They were already crazy before they got drunk! Not trying to hate, I love them.
Oh honey nobody really eats KFC in Kentucky. Trust me, lived all my life in Kentucky and lived near one.
Fake drunk
Follow me on Instagram k_c__lynch I will sub to your channel
the try guys drunk is probably my worst nightmare... i hate people who are annoying
Keith: "THIS IS SO F*CKING GOOD!" 
Me:  🤣
The real battle: Taco Bill vs Del Taco
Which one gives you diarrhoea faster?
Yum brands represent lol
"Whopper King" hahahhaa
Tell me why Keith and Zach are me and my bestie...sober
In Kentucky (at least in my area), KFC is disappearing, or combining with other food chains (building wise)... Everyone eats lees or popeyes unless they have a coupon.
yup they drunk...
That guy looks like a horse.
I wonder how they got home/worked
tbh I would date Zach
I thought Keith was lactose intolerant
Dorito tacos are amazing but pizza is the ultimate drunk food,  I don't care
Eugene is so perfect
He doesn't even have the Asian Flush
Whoever edited this video needs a raise
Anytime Eugene and alcohol are in the same video...it's epic
I want the pizza hut. I want the taco bell. I want the combination pizza hut-and-taco bell

Like if you know the song
Obviously y'all need to go to Waffle House.
zach's drunk laugh LMAO
seems more like gay guys try fast food
is it just me or does this video seem a little like they're not drunk
"you don't know that" "yes i do" "you don't know that" "ronald's my neighbor" 😂😂😂
Yall should get them high af now
Eugeune needs to be a guest on jknews
the title is so confusing
i love these guys so much
Where I live we do not have Popeyes's we only have kfc and Mary browns
popeyes is NASTY
SOFT AND NEAT
This was so great.
I aspire to be like Keith when I'm drunk
This video literally made my iq -500
Lalala
They should have done chick fil aaaaa
Cute butt Zach ;) Favorite parts: seeing Zach's butt, KFC "La, la, la", and Eugine crying over the fact that taco bell is bomb drunk but sober untouchable
editing A+
keith and zach are so cute together!
so fake
This was gold.
This is sooooo funny
what I've learned is popular fast food empires taste good, in other news water is wet
We finally got to see Zach's underwear...
what ever they pay you its not enuf
The end though haha
Yo who else is watching this while being druk
3:48
Where is the Wendy's girl when u need her
Ned at 1:30-1:45 is ny favorite
the last minute seat switch threw me off i thought it was mandela effect for a minute😂
KFCs in Kentucky are nasty. Either they have terrible taste or they cook the chicken differently in LA.
3:51 IM DYING
Pizza Hut is literally trash
At the end, when he's like "Why are you laughing? What is happening?" that's exactly what my friend said, and how she said it, when me and my other friend were laughing our asses off the other day.. but we were high not drunk
popeyes all day
I was 💀 the whole video
Watching this high had me geeking man! Great video!!!
I love the intensity in this video
I don't know, I guess I've been visiting the best KFC's and the worst Popeye's cause it seems like everyone loves Popeye's lol
What about Church's?
Literally me when theres no sauce.
Y'all need to try chick fil a
"Inaudible crying" 😂😂😂😭
10 out of 10 will watch again
i'm on a low carb diet, not sure why i'm watching this. i think i'm trying to sabotage myself.
4GAYs
They're clearly not drunk.....
If anything they're closer to being high but yea, they're sober.
Still funny though!
better sauce, better burger, better people Papa John's 😂😂😂😂
I would literally love to work at buzzfeed, it looks like so much fun.
Did it bother anyone else that they switched who was eating with who in the middle of the video
lol Keith's reaction when there's no hot sauce "WHAT ARE WE DOING!!??!!??"
"La La La!"  kkkkk lmao
Drunk people are sf annoying lol
start a drunk try guy series buzzfeed
I watched this while eating an apple.
The only time I've ever found the Try Guys cringy.
Taco bell and pizza hut are owned by the same company so lol (kfc is also owned as t he same company as taco bell and pizza hut)
Looking back at the photoshop episode  I realized that the TryGuys really wanted to change their bodies but mention that time, money, and support was an issue. I say that they start a 90 day challenge in which the initially start with a gofundme to raise money for training, food, and other necessities. Once the money is raised they should all have a daily vlog or every other day vlog of their process over the 90 days. That way they can all support each other and strive for what they've all wanted. Like my comment if you agree with my idea!
ahh some Cook Out would be the best ever. Too bad its only in the east coast!
soft and neat
Wait... did they switch at the end?
I am in love with Eugene
Now Buzzfeed should do the same thing but for people who are hella baked.
To all the people who are triggered that they think KFC is good, they were drunk, they couldn't think properly.
Give these guys some fish n chips with irish curry sauce, and they will never want any of these things ever again
i'm french, why I see that xD
Drunk Keith is my favourite human.
Drunk try guys is my favorite try guys.
They're so drunk omg 😂😂
mom: how was your lunch?
me: 1:59
"yeah I do Ronalds my neighbor "
no hate here but i'm not really a fan of drunk try guys. but that's probably just me.
thats how u know they are white.. when they have no  sauce with their chicken
I hate fried chicken and chicken wings of any kind also I hope people find this comment and no this is not a joke I hate fried chicken
SOFT AND NEAT
Keith is literally me when I have no Taco Bell sauce
bit too drunk....
lol ned.
i love zach and keith drunk they get funnier than ever😂❤
#fixiDubbbzTV
why isn't anyone talking about Keith
I hate fried chicken. Like if you agree
This is the best thing I've ever seen
This made me so hungry
try guys try quince dresses



like if you agree
olivia newton-john travolta 😂😂😂😂😂😂
frame-boiled
OMG KEITH
omgod just omgod
The only drive thru open when I'm drunk is McDonalds, so it becomes the default fast food drunk stop lol
If you've never had KFC from Trinidad you have never lived before
Wait, what video is the one showed in clips in the beginning?
Please make them reacted to this video when they're sober
Sassy drunk Eugene is worth the watch
Idk these guys seem high instead of being drunk
Ned is my favorite drunk omg
Drunk Keith is my favorite
Please do another video where the Try Guys are all drunk again but have them eat stoner food combinations like in Shane Dawson's stoner foods video
i just cant get over keith and the sauce
Why was Eugene  crying all of a sudden😂
I don't LOVE KFC but in my country there's not even Popeyes soooo xd
This is why I wanna work for buzzfeed.
Are they all homosexual?
I'm a simple guy
I see keith
I click
LALALA
@1:45




Hilarious.
I love drunk Ned.
How much did Eugene drink?
Smh only white people would choose KFC over Popeyes
AGGH I can't get over Keith 😂
nothing beats kebab while drunk
DId you notice how they switched partners like midway...?



Also, Pizza anyday(:
The Try Guys Try to Pretend to be Drunk.
I think the try guys should play yandere simulator
SOFT AND NEAT
This was hilarious
whoever edited this did a supreme job and i've never laughed so much at a buzzfeed video EVER #papajohns
Would anyone miss these people if they died in a freak "accidental" fire
"Better fries, better burger, Papa John's" Lmfao I love Ned in every video but He's a blast Drunk
Drunk Keith omg 😂
Try guys try slurping each other off
Popeyes is WAY better than KFC
HAHAHAHA IM SERIOUSLY DYING
Taco bell is usally the only thing open at 3 am when you're coming home drunk so it wins!
Wendys vs everything
I grew up being taught that Taco Bell has rat meat
The burger at the whopper king place 😂😂😂
Doritos Tacos are loge
"When people are drunk they get more honest" A tiny bit after Eugene says Ronald McDonald is his neighbor.
u got to be drunk tov eat kfc lol
👏🏽 KFC 👏🏽IS 👏🏽NOT 👏🏽BETTER 👏🏽THAN 👏🏽POPEYES 👏🏽
this is the funniest thing😂
kieth made the whole video funny af
Raising Cane's is better than KFC and Popeye's. 

fight me
If this is a April fools video then were they acting drunk?😂
pfft light weights i need at least 2 four lokos to get drunk or a quarter of a large vodka bottle
we don't have taco bell nor do we really have tacos in newzealand😭😭😭
Pause the video, then go to 4:18 and look at Ned's face
I would love to hang out with drunk Keith he seems like so much fun 😂 but hey sober Keith is also really fun so I'd love to hang out with him anytime 😂
this video is why I'm subscribed to buzzfeed
THIS VIDEO IS SO GOOD
Ned is iconic! I love him 😭
I'm not so sure that these "drunk" videos are a good idea. There's no way to prevent young kids from watching them, and while they don't specifically glamorize drinking, they certainly legitimize it. I'm not saying that occasional drinking is bad or anything, but is it wise to normalize drinking alcohol in an arena where there are no real age restrictions?
this video made me laugh!
I want to get drunk with them so bad.
I'm from
Australia and I wish we had Popeyes! I've never tasted it but it just seems so much more like fried chicken 😂 lets be real! Still love KFC! Just cause I have nothing to compare it to 🙄
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are subsidiaries of the same parent company
This is the best video ever
Did they get drunk or high?! lolz still love it
im just imagining them watching this back sober hahaha!!😂
nothing compares to your grandmas homemade fried chicken . better then any fast food

I swear, BuzzFeed should really be called Buzzed Feed
"But the burger hamburger at the whopper king place" OMG Ned is adorable
poofter's..poofter's everywhere!!
I don't like fried chicken ☹️😨
They should make a video reacting to them drunk
😂😂😂😂drunk try guys are the BEST!
Keith is me drunk
They are much more funnier drunk 😵
SOFT AND NEAT
I love how buzzfeed credits men with the intelligence of a cheese stick
Is it just me or did every guy in this video seem a little gay?
They need to try Bojangles if they think KFC is the best fast food fried chicken. It's like KFC's better looking, cooler, older brother.
Keith and Ned are so cute and funny drunk
Ned didn't mention his wife!!!!
god I love you guys 🤣🤣🤣💞💞💞
they should always edit their videos like this one, it's hands down way funnier like this !
how many of there guys are gay lol wtf??
i did wanna see that zach
the try guys turn into the gay guys when drunk
idk how you can eat fast food while drunk, the smell of fast food while drunk makes me absolutely sick as it is
i dont see the doritos in here *eats a taco
"What even is this??"
i just realized towards the end of the video that they were switching off pairs on who's eating with who each time.
soft and neat
Who else here lives in Louisiana and eats Popeyes because in Louisiana there is the original Popeyes and no copyers
They lost all credibility when they all chose KFC over Popeye's.
"Eat bread!" How about no. I am gluten free because it makes me bloated and sick.
better quality chicken, better seasoning, papa johns lmfao
I like Popeyes better
3:52 lmao 😂😂😂😂
The Try Guys try the world's most giant swing XD
I wish I could get paid to be drunk and eat! Lmfao dream job!
they look more high than drunk lol
Guys their sober
"Louisiana vs. Ken-tuck-aye-ay"
taco bell saga
As a person from Kentucky, I prefer Popeye's.
Y'all should have tried "Bojangles".
Bruh... Churches Chicken beats out both of those.    Them Honey Butter Biscuits...
very suspicious that they "tested" all 3 Yum brand restaurants. Pretty sure they got $$$$$$$$$$$$$
can u try filipino food??
ps..
I love zack
I think Papa John's got the most recognition yet never got the opportunity for a drunk test ... #feelsbadman  (^_^)
most annoying video ever
"Why chose one can you can have them all" 
Exactly in this case for the Try Guys
S O F T A N D N E A T
Papa John's tho
Plz more of these videos
taco?... they should've tried crunchwrap supreme
Drunk people are so funny 😂😂😂😂
buzzfeed has some of the ugliest employees ever
i dont think eugene is drunk, i think he's high
this is the moment where jenna marbles was necessary bc of the lack of taco sauce n' the fact that jenna was prepared for this exact time @JennaMarbles
The entire time I watched this video all I thought about was how hard they must've blown up the bathroom afterwards 😂😂
Is no one really gonna talk about eugene almost crying because of a taco?
NACHO BELL GRANDE
CHEESY GORDITA
I LIKE YOUR TACOS LIKE DIARRHEA
MAN, I REALLY LIKE TACOO BELL
|-/
SOFT AND NEAT

LONG LIVE BURGER KING!!!!🍔🍟🍷
i love that when these guys are drunk, their latent gay selves come out lmao

"I can't see the doritos in this" -Ned2K17
Keith is me with no sauce
I don't think I've ever seen them this drunk for a video lmao
I'm surprised they got Eugene that drunk!
Gayest thing I've seen on youtube...
Watching Euguene cry is so satisfying to me. Cry away perfect man show me youre not a robot
"it was just a piece of stray lettuce" 😂😂😭
r they fagets?
That moment when Ned didn't talk about his wife.
kfc is so dry though.....
i'm vegan yet will still passionately defend popeyes as being WAY better than kfc come on y'all, you make bad decisions when you're drunk lmao (p.s. popeyes battered fries are vegan and they're really good, life is beautiful because of these fries)
I was about to murder them through my phone when ALL FOUR OF THEM SAID KFC WAS BETTER THAN POPEYES.
I've never had to co bell
Plot twist: They're not actually drunk.  This is an April Fools' Day joke.
inaudibly cries
hahaha! !!!
Soft and Neat
you guys are awesome X3 thank you for making my day!
they've never ate McDonald's before??
I'm vegan.
Whataburger honey butter biscuit at 3am... heaven.
Heaven Sent Chicken is 100% better, especially with their bread....
Eugene: "No one wants to see that Zach."
Zach: "There are people who wanna see that."
I am those people, and those people are me.
KFC is so salty to me
Instagram : roxanne_roxxanne

April fools!
Make them go high
These four drunk is so damn funny. Ned is completely different drunk he's like they get it lets eat!
'It's got stores nationwide...' but there is no taco bell in England! Why?!?
Unsubscribed, nobody says Kfc is better than Popeyes😤😤😒
Looks like such a great time
theyre good at pretending to be drunk
This is probably their best day on buzzfeed. 😂😆
3:16 "NOOO NOOO!" 😂😂😭
Papa John's is declared the winner
Now I want junk food .....
There is no battle. Popeyes is better than KFC
5:04 the most emotion we've ever seen from eugene
Australians may not be kings of the burgers but we are kings of the donut (Donut king vs Dunkin donuts and Hungry jacks vs Burger king
"Even a drunk person knows that's bad."
I love drunk Try Guys
Eugene looks so much like the Kimara Black from this season of Rupauls Drag   Race
They get it let's eat it 😂👌😂
Kieth was epic in this video. Lol
This is my new favorite thing
are these guys gay?
I am going to say it again: Try Guys try designing and modeling runway clothes would be epic!
Ned drunk makes my day
I wanna be high and do this haha
They're being so extra
More drunk videossssssss
Two guys one burger
their opinions are illegitimate bc they said kfc is better than popeyes n i cannot accept that
How many drinks do you think it took to get Eugene drunk?
"Burger hamburger at the whopper King place" 

"Olivia Newtown John Travola"
3:50 Keith transforms into Jerry Seinfeld
Oh my gosh. They're eating bread.... IN CALIFORNIA!!!!!







It's a joke. Don't get butt hurt
I don't even like to eat when I'm drunk lol, but when I'm stoned that's a whole different story lol
Drunk Try Guys are the best Try Guys
Zach's "Oh My God" is killing me😂😂😂😂
What are we doing?????!!!
Do high guys best HIGH FAST FOOD!
also tacobell beats any pizza anytime unless tacobell adds backn tonthere menu
i kove kfc ....but it sometimes has a soap aftertaste in alot of citys
KFC reminded me of 7-eleven. Try 7- eleven chicken wings or rather the whole hot foods from 7-eleven.
soft and neat
They should release the drunk try guys into the office.
This is so cringy, come one Buzzfeed you're clearing running out of ideas
Hey guys! A few things you need to try...
1) all you can eat KFC ( yes there is a KFC buffet in Saskatchewan) 
2) A&W ( Alberta beef) 
3) Peanut butter bacon burger ( Hudson Canadian Tap house- opt for bacon instead of bacon jelly)
4) Bob and Doug Club ( Hudson Canadian Tap House) 
5) legit poutine in Canada 
What I'm trying to say is.... come to Canada and try our foods. ❤️
like= kiss your crush
subscribe= win the lottery
reply= 1 year good luck
Have a great day :)
they seem like annoying drunks
Should've been Wendy's vs Burger King
they all got really gay with the booze
I SEE FOOD. I GET HUNGRY. LOL.  I am a New YouTuber friends. I Write Stories. Can you take out two minutes and watch my work. Thank you.
S o f t a n d n e a t
Taco Bell vs. Pizza Hut is not a fair fight. Then again, Pizza Hut vs. my stomach isn't a fair fight.
3:53 - 3:56 when the teacher says "clear your desk" 😂😂
I'm drunk and I would do all of them except the asian one. 🤣🤣🤣
Keith COULD have said "fries between my thighs"...but he didn't..
burger king is better then mc donalds as my opinion
I am completely sure that Ned is a straight man with homosexual tendencies.
4:17 face
😂😂😂
"Don't eat without me, motherf*cker." 
"It was a stray piece of lettuce."
Drunk try guys = confused children
like ir you're drunkk!!!!
i don't like fried chicken
Ned when he drunk. 😂 i need a series of this. 👌👌
This is garbage
y not dominoes and pizza hut
do they only get drunk for buzzfeed videos lol they're actin like teenagers
"Kentuckiayyyy" okay Ned 😂
4:22-4:23 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Yeah rondals my neighbor" HAHAHAHAHAHA
I don't care if buzzfeed's pulling an april fools prank on us in the form of a try guys video, this is hands down the best try guys video ever
"Uh yah, Ronald's my neighbour"
~Eugene
I wanna get drunk with try guys :D
This episode of worth it seems a little different..
THIS IS MY FAVORITE VIDEO IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!!!!!!!
La la la
They should've done Taco Bell vs Taco Cabana
Popeyes is better than KFC
that Burger king bun looks pretty soft and neat
Marijuana!!!!!!
Olivia Newton John Travolta
The try guys are the best!
Burger King is absolutely vile 🤢
The try guys have gotten so old.
This is so funny I'm dead😂😂😂
y'all must have been FUCKED UP to really think KFC is better than Popeyes lmfao
Now these guys are squad goals!
KFC over Popeye's??? Are you drunk?!? Oh, wait...
Hahahaha the end when Eugene doesn't get the Papa John's joke
KFC is disgusting
And every youtuber wants views. Whats the point in making youtube videos if you don't have views?
I would love to try this with my best friend, but none of these fast food places are in my hometown. I think only burger king, mc donalds and maybe pizza hut are in my country. But far away from my town
You guys should do something like Try Guys Wear Makeup for a Week. I feel like it would shine a light on normalizing guys wearing makeup
Yes that Emoji they obviously  they do that because every youtuber does that either way buzzfeed did not force them to get drunk and eat food it was their choice.
Heehee! Drunk Eugene is just sober Keith 😅😂🍹
I was expecting Pizza Hut vs Dominos..
Uncle's donkey
"...but the burger, hamburger ahdgfdhth whopper king place-"
"you're killin' it, ned!"
The Try Guys Try Nude Modeling. They're comfortable being naked around each other now, but let's see how that changes when they have to hold the same pose for an hour or more while their friends draw them--or better yet, toss them into an art classroom with complete strangers.
The day Americans will give up their fast food will be the day hell freezes over.
The Drunk Try Guys.
just saying. I've eaten a whole 20 inch pizza drunk on my own.... I'm 13
Sure they weren't high too?
Looks like the same way farms do to there livestock.  Drug them up and feed them crap.
zac is so so so so cute when he's drunk
I was dying in this video 😂😂😂😂
How is Keeth the same person..
This was one of the most hilarious videos they've done in a while
Soft and N E A T
mood 1:59
i am but i simple man.
i see Taco Bell in the thumbnail & i hit Thumbs Up.
Drunk Try Guys are hilarious 😂😂😂 zach is just cute and giggly, ned is just all over the place, eugene is so serious and keith is just the best its like watching a shakespeare play 😂😂😂
I lost it at "Olivia Newton John Travolta"
Laughed so hard when watching this video.
I feel like they r not drunk and that they r faking
Definitely one of my favorite try guy videos in a while! I love you guys!
KENTUCKAYE
lolz, the whole time they were mentioning papa john's but for the pizza they went with pizza hut?! awww, shucks. XD also, zac...you don't KNOW whether or not taco bell will give you the runs? XD (isn't that the ongoing joke with taco bell? that it'll make you go?) don't worry eugene, i don't like taco bell either................i don't understand anyone who says they love or even like taco bell.......
I relate to zack with taco bell
SOFT AND NEAT
neds wife?
Sooo I saw TWILIGHT AND ALL THE MOVIES IT WAS AMAZING I LOVED IT GO SEE ALL THE MOVIES NOW GO ❤️❤️❤️💖💖
Oh lawd! What I wouldn't give for some KFC and mashed potatoes right now..... I'm jelly...
this is beautiful
fast food greasy taco i love
Who would choose Popeyes over kfc
the drunk try guys are my favorite try guys.
When they sang "lalala" I thought they sounded like teletubbies
do stoners eat dumplings
I wonder how miserable a person gotta be to 'thumbs down' a video. if I don't like a video,  I'll click on another.
buzzfeed getting their employees drunk, feeding them? = amaizing
Great now I'm hungry
Why is no one talking about how cute drunk zack is?
this video made me crack up so much, just made my day :)
Been waiting for this
As a life long Vegetarian, someone explain the whole KFC vs Popeyes thing to me. Is it like a legit debate?
This is me sober...
"Yeah Ronald's my neighbor." Sure jan (Eugene) But also I would say that too without being drunk. lol
S O F T A N D N E A T
Where's Chick Fil A and Arby's?
LOL this was stupidly hilarious
wait did Eugene actually start crying?!?! 😂
I'm at the pizza hut! I'm at the taco bell! I'm at the combination pizza hut and taco bell!
they're so drunk
Keith and Zach are so cute lmao
They're all pretty much the same people
whoever edit this video did a good job 😂
who wants to see Zach without pants? 🙋
who else "wanted to see that"
"yuck yuck yuck ew ew"
"You're talking too much" always me
Jesus Christ you're not high on anesthetics
Zack IS SO cute drunk
every time I see things like this I'm reassured once again that I would get along with Ned so well.
"Olivia Newton John Travolta." It's so weird to see Eugene drunk.  I thought his tolerance was too high to get drunk. :)
I need more drunk try guys
Ya Ronald's my neighbor 😂😂
It should of been Pizza Hut vs dominos pizza
WTH Popeyes is way better than KFC, you guys must be.....oh wait
Eugine ❤
KEITH IS MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE DRUNK
everyone knows.. the fiery ones are the best of the tacos
I have a feeling that when the try guys watch this, they're going to regret and laugh
i'm so concerned why did Eugene start sobbing over tacos???
KFC is trash, the absolute worst chicken ever
I love them all so much.
yelling doesn't make a video more interesting
"well f*ck me and call me an uncles donkey."  then u just hear a voice in the back, "yeah?"
soft and neat
taco bell is drunk people's food 😍tacos and chicken quesadilla
I feel like i've seen this before...
Anyone else notice there's been a lot more Try Guys videos lately?  And I'm ok with that. :)
Keith is such a treasure.
april fools. they're not drunk.
eugene hates taco bell i unstan
man what an original and creative video idea
"Olivia Newton John Travolta wait, did they do that on purpose?"
😂😂😂
They're so giggly and messy
I kind of like them better drunk because they arent scripted. doesnt sound so fake
2:40
"Well f**k me and call me an uncles donkey" - Eugene
Will it nacho!?
Drunk Zach is my favorite Zach
Wendy's above all. #Fact
you should try it all while high
Hold up do people not eat entire pizzas by themselves? If you're alone you order two pizzas. One for dinner and one for breakfast.
Every signal one of these guys could be singled out for different reasons for how hilarious they are drunk.
better people, papa john LOOOOL
I totally liked this vid because these beautiful people picked KFC over popeyes<3
When they say buzzfeed's out of ideas, just doing food taste videos over and over again, they decided to get drunk for this one to make a difference
KFC is gross
universe=us ^^
I hate that they're acting gay
i wish there was a black guy in the try guys
So, what do you do for fun on the weekends? lol
You guys should make slime
omg this is the best thing I've seen all day!
You can't have a drunk food test without Del Taco
Next Episode: The try guys run out of ideas
Why is this so funny!?!?! 😂😂😂😂
SOFT AND NEAT
no bleeping? wow!
Next time I go to KFC , i''m gonna say la la la after everything
Bahahaha
KFC is only good outside of Kentucky for some reason. I used to live in the town where KFC was created and that was just trash, but KFC in Cali was amazing. Don't know how that works.
3:50

McDonald's has human DNA in their burgers search it up

Keith is literally me
10/10
My roommate: I love them drunk. They need to do all their videos drunk.
I really enjoyed this video. The Try Guys RULE
Love how Eugene thinks it's impressive to drunkenly eat a whole pizza. Doesn't everyone just eat a whole pizza every time? And Dominos pizza is better than Pizza Hut, discuss.
I want a reaction gif of Keith & Zach going "NOOOOO NO IT'S NOT"
Lol this is gold
Popeye's > KFC
Taco Bell will never beat real Mexican tacos
loool
if I say a person drunk and act gay I'm out 👌
SOFT AND NEAT

The Fry tights....... Nope okay
"Inaudible crying" I lost it! 😂
If you are reading this you will have a great day

pitorP
Last one should have been Pizza Hut and dominos
Keith and Zach drunk can become a reality show called "La-la-la-la-laaaa"
Now they should eat all of this sober.
cute
oh my god how much did they drink????
PizzaHut isn't even good anymore. I prefer the local pizza business.
Did they edit the video drunk?
if you guys are having a bad day just watch this...or my videos
they look soft and neat
Pizza Hut vs Taco Bell was the funniest out of them all.
Zack is the cutest drunk human besides Eugene but he can't get drunk, and I wanna marry Zack and Eugene both
Am I the only one who thinks KFC fried chicken is extremely salty?
Burger King's Burgers and Fries Are Better Than McDonald's if I had to eat one or the other.
the try gays drunk fast food taste test
the spices on kfc make drunk keith sing😂😂😂😂😂






La La La!
Eugene seems so horrified at himself that he would eat Taco Bell drunk
Am I the only one that gets annoyed of Eugene???!!
I don't trust anybody that picks KFC over Popeyes , it's just not right .
OMG FINALLY SOMEONE ACTUALLY NOTICED KENTUCKY!!!!!
The Try Guys should get high and then taste test fast food.
we need more of this, especially Ned being gay xD
WHO on earth thinks Mcdonald fries are better than bk? Bk are reaaalllyyy crispy and Mcdonalds are soggy. Or that's how it is where I am.
SOFT AND NEAT
love'em even more when they're drunk 💫
Ha gayyyyyyyyy!
There are 100% people who want to see Zack in his underwear. And less.
Jack in the box tacos are the best when drunk
They should show them drinking before calling them ,,drunk"
Why do they all turn gay when drunk
Jack in the box tacos are the real drink taco
Papa Johns better sponsor the shiz outta them!!!
they should get drunk for all of their videos
I'm just happy with how drunk they are! This was way more entertaining than those lightly tipsy "drunk" videos some Youtubers do! 😂
NEAT AND SOFT
The guy from 4:15 sounded like a character from the sausage party
I cannot stop laughing 😂😂 Love the try guys!
Soft and neat
happy April fools
So Keith turned into Seinfeld lol
brought to you by the combination pizza hut/taco bell/kfc
"Olivia Newton John Travolta" hahahaha
focuses on Eugene
I want to be drunk with the Try Guys. Epic times.
They look like such sissies when they're sharing food. I got annoyed.
favorite video so far 😂😂
I like how there so over dramatic when there drunk😂
Soooo.... y'all just gone disrespect Popeyes like that
Getting Taco Bell without sauce????? WTF!!!!
The taco bell part has me in tears! 😂😂😂
whatever eugene picks i pick like if you agree
chick-fil-a is by far the best chicken
April Fool - this was all acting.
I'm sick of Del taco getting snubbed people!
Drunk Keith > Sober Eugene
phandom kys pls
Ur KILLIN it Ned
"Olivia Newton John Travolta " OMG I never noticed that lmao ...MIND BLOWN
Doritos Los Tacos are everything that is right, and everything that is wrong with America, and it's a beautiful thing.
i feel like the person who edited this was also drunk
lalala~
I HATE fried chicken! I'm a vegetarian too but still😑
Soft and Neat

SOFT AND NEAT
Nearly died laughing at Keith's face at 3:50 hahahah
Gosh, I love them so much.
They should have had the Mexican pizza instead of the tacos
I had just eaten taco bell to
" Look how ... immaculate the top bun is"
haha they gonna have alcohol issues lol
Ok
I get Keith how can you eat a taco with out sauce 🤣
waiting for a try guys try a vegan diet
I eat a whole pizza and a half after I smoked some bud lol
I gotta go out with them and get super drunk! :3 And eat, of course!! :3
So basically everything drunk is amazing?  Yes.
Zach's "OH MEH GOD OH MEH GOD" has me in tears 😂😂😭
this was so satisfying watching
When you run out of ideas
Dominos > Pizza Hut
My friend told me that Keith is my drunk spirit animal and it is absolutely the best compliment I have ever received.
"It's like Olivia Newton John Travolta all over my hands. Wait their names combined?! Did they do that on purpose????!!!!" OMG IM CRACKING UP
KFC is trash 😷🤢
these guys have been feminized. wtf where are the real people at? buzzfeed is trying to push this off as the social norm
The title doesn't make sense grammatically. It should read "The Drunk Try Guys Taste Test Fast Food"
I wish I had friends
alright you guys gotta do this just instead of drunk do HIGH
I think if Steve would of been drunk with Steven on worth it, he would of stayed, look at how he acts drunk, way more personality
I used to have loyalties. WHERE DO THEY LIE.
I can eat a pizza by myself sober..😂
I Want to be Best friends with the try guys I cant believe their trying fast foods i love the try guys
Mc Donald's has two new sandwiches and they are mc junior and the grand mac
Zack every 5 minutes "Omakah"
I don't understand the "soft and neat"
KFC sucks, or at least the one where I live sucks. Last time I ate there I got food poisoning, and the same thing happened to a bunch of my friends as well.
so am I only one that eats carne asada fries when I'm drunk?
So, did the dude in glasses get hair restoration surgery?
"Yea, Ronald's my neighbor " 😂 Preach Eugene!
They get so gay when they're drunk
I NEVER CLICKED ON A VIDEO FASTER THAN I HAVE CLICKED THIS ONE
im on a try guys binge watch for 4 days straight now because mini vacation and i spent it on these 4 adorable boys #noregrets

"Everyone loves fried chicken"

SOFT AND NEAT
Keith KILLS me lol. Love him.
Try a real Mexican taco

I would actually just get along so well with Keith. Just everything would make sense, drunk, sober, high, tiered, giggly moods, Kim Kardashian. It would all make sense. 😦😧😦😧😦😧😶
Popeyes > KFC
Umm where were the monza sticks and poutine.... thats the ultimate drunk food
Burger hamburger at the whopper king place 😂😂
dennys, Jack in the box, In n out or taco truck
BURGER KING IS A BURGER KING NOT A FRY LORD done
Just when I thought I couldn't smile today...

I guess taco bell puts Laxatives in the food
SOFT AND NEAT

Forever wishing we had Taco Bell in the UK...

Was Eugene crying because of Taco Bell?

The Dry Guys Don't Drink Alcohol.
Eugene is a mean drunk. LOL
"I wouldn't eat Taco Bell Sober." then just start cry OMG!!!! I love him.
In this video Eugene reminds me of Zac Efron for some reason lmao
I would love to get drunk with this kind of guys (hahaha too funny)
IT isn't fair the refs were absolutly drunk
Keith is straight up high
I'm so hungry now
When your drunk the shittier food is much better.
Omfg I cannot stop laughing 😂😂

The next video should be them to react to this 😂😂
I don't like fried chicken
I wish they weren't so bad at acting drunk.
Olivia Newton John Travolta 😂 that made me stop for a minute
KFC over Popeyes they really are drunk
Is zack gay? 💘x
I wish I could get drunk at work without having to hide it. Lol nvr did it but omg
"There are people who want to see that." Same Zac 😂
They are even more adorable and funny while drunk.
No A&W?! What is this?? Fear Factor????

"There are people who want to see that." Me...I'm that person, Zach 😂
Who pays for the food. And i want some KFC and pizza
They should make their own YouTube channel
The only reason i sub buzzfeed is because of them
As a Kentuckian i have to agree kfc is a lot better and if they didn't choose it i would have to kill them :-)
I'm dying😂😂
la la la
The ultimate showdown of drunken munchies...
Keith without his sauce is literally me
Gay mode on
Zach is so adorable!!!!!!!!!
He's so pure and looks so small and precious <3
This is my favorite video on the Internet

Eugene needs to impregnate me immediately thank q

They either drunk to much i know doesn't take much to get Ned and Zach acting wack as they act wack before legally drunk. Or Keith and Eugine where also high as even legally drunk they don't really act drunk.
The whopper is my favorite 😭 you made me hungry for Whopper.
Omg Eugene getting emotional over taco bell is me
KFC endorsement

My dad walked in and asked "why do you like watching these guys, there not the most masculine?" 
I said "they're funny and cute."
"Well you shouldn't watch them" and he walked out
Before you ask, yes he's homophobic and has banned the watching of lbgbtqa+ things in the house....
I LOVE BURGER KING!MORE THAN MCDONALDS!ALOT MORE!NO OFFENCE TO MCDONALD LOVERS!JUST MY OPINION!
So Super gay its hard to watch
What was it like editing this video?
Whataburger is definitely the place to go after a night out

As someone trying to quit smoking weed this makes me feel more exited to start drinking again lol
I thought of making a terrible joke about when Keith says "He's a Burger King not a Fry Lord". All I can say is that it involved a German dictator.

Honestly.. KFC was the best thing ever when I got super drunk.
my subscription to buzzfeed and putting up with their other god awful videos is always rewarded when they put out a try guy video, especially a drunk try guy video
3:10 honestly, the cutest moment in this video
they were trying to hard to be "drunk"
Grow up try guys, pretty pathetic that your all still acting like your in your teens!
It would be nice to see the four of them put on suits and TRY getting real jobs for a change instead of making assholes of themselves!
LMAO

Being drunk, not wearing any pants... Just another day at the office.
As a Kentucky girl I completely support "let's taste Kentucky" 😉
I've never ate KFC, but I know that Popeye's is better.
April fools!  They're actually gay hipsters.
Did anybody realize that Ned & Zach switched in this video?
pizza hut, kfc, and taco bell are all under the same company, TASTY (or something like that). and TASTY also sponsors buzzfeed. coincidence? i think not.
Here's a free piece of content advice. Do this but when they're high and see if the results vary.
im getting so hungry
The title of this video should be called gays try fast food.
SOFT AND NEAT
they're clearly not drunk and just bullshitiing.

These are the type of guys that get drunk after a 4 pack
drunk Keith is the best Keith
everyone is singing pappa johns song
They should have made another video where they all sober up and react to watching this video 😂
Half of the comments are about how they chose KFC over Popeye's. The other half is just SOFT AND NEAT

NICE AND SOFT
We just need them to be drunk more often
Lol I love them all so much.
Of course the white people chose KFC

Zach and Ned both did the papa johns slogan, am I the only one who thought that was hilarious?

How much did Eugene have to drink before hand to be equally as dunk as everyone else
can somebody explain this soft and neat thing ??

Burger King has a ton of transfat don't eat it
Why there is no black guy in this vid? Racism?
Anyone replaying Eugene crying?
This video has made me want 2 things now. 
1 Kfc & Burger king (Pizza huts nice but not in the mood for it) 
2 to maybe get drunk with Americans...just once.

1. Mcdonalds vs. Burger King- Mcdonalds wins
2. Popeyes vs. KFC- KFC wins
3. Pizza Hut vs. Taco Bell- Tie
The try guys are the best thing about BuzzFeed
Love The Try Guys; and Keith is absolutely right:  You can't eat any of Taco Bell's tacos without any sauce.  It NEEDS it.
Great . . Now I`m craving fast food :(

Eugene blew my mind with the Grease thing.
Why do the try guys make everything gay when they're drunk
The try guys are squad goals but is Eugene still at buzz feed or not?  😔
this is actually so funny when they started singing at 3:09 and when eugene felt embarrassed because he liked taco bell i just can't
1:59

no one was drunk btw
Soft and Neat
Side eyeing all of them for declaring KFC is better than Popeyes 😑🍗
Just sayin theu got white people eating Popeyes. Popeyes would've won with black people
I think Kai and Onew would fight Keith for that. No one loves fried chicken as Onew or Kai do.
Popeyes is dry KFC is bomb
soft and neat
what is this title?
You guys should try weed
KFC can't even compete with Popeyes 💀
Soft and neat amiright
Grown men get drunk that fast or is that an extreme over exaggeration?
Idk why, but Zach and Eugene are adorable together 😂
i preffer the nacho cheese tacos
I wanna be best friends with Keith and Zac
Buzzfeed is for people who aren't talented enough to be famous
"Do we have any sauce?"
"No." 
"...WHAT ARE WE DOING?!!
LOL
this, worth it and buzzfeed unsolved are the only reasons i watch buzzfeed
lol drunk try guys are better
got a little too colorful at points for my taste
4:22 eugene what are u doing LMAO
The Try Guys should get drunk more often... This was hilarious and I love them.
omg eugene cried?! 😂😂😂
Oh my god I freaking love them. 😂😂😂
i want to be best friends with all of them
"Burger King is a burger king, not a fries lord' I CANT

"Even a drunk person knows this tastes bad combined, nope, yuck yuck yuck" 😂😂
IM LMAO YOU GUYS ARE SO FUNNY
This makes me want to go to all these places and order the largest thing on the menu
i want my life to be made up of getting drunk and eating fast food
the bruger....hambruger at the whopperking is....
Blasphemy! Popeyes spicy chicken is way better!
I love how Keith shared the food and when Ned wants to share with Eugene he's like, no. lol
Me and keith are the same person when it comes to fried chicken
ned and keith for the win
This is so fake lmao
Taco Bell over everything.
I don't believe that they are actually drunk.
Soft and neat
Try guys high food taste test
these people are all overwhelmingly amazing
i want the pizza hut, I want the taco bell....I want the combination pizza hut and taco bell
I went to my local Dairy Queen the other day and they accidentally gave me a burger with 4 patties! I don't know why, and I did not care!
This is my favorite video ever 😂
I believe little Zach and Keith are the drunkest, Eugene is the best at holding his liquor, Ned is jest highly buzzed, Zach and Keith are plastered!
what if you have no friends... fml
this is so fake
When you are drunk everything tastes good
2:15 what is Eugene saying? I don't get it
la la laa
step 1: like
step 2: add to favorites list
They do 3 rounds in their taste test videos because there are exactly

4x3
------------- /2 = 3

Plot-twist: They weren't drunk

I wonder what they would prefer if they get high smoking weed hahah
I want to see the try guys drunk way more often it's hilarious
"Don't eat without me motherf*cker" 😂😂😂

Zach drunk is sooooo cute❤️😍
They're even more gay than usual

Please go to Washington and do this but high
is Eugene gay?
They should've had the 5 layer bean burrito from taco bell... that thing is amazing.
Try Guys make videos are amazing, DRUNK Try Guys however are an ultimate win
I clicked into this thinking it would just be another generic Buzzfeed video and now I'm going to order KFC and get drunk.
you could tell they were definitely drunk because they chose KFC over Popeyes
0:18 Zach: showing off his assets Eugene: No one wants to see you, Zach! literally looks at Zach
Omg this is so funny!
is anyone else lowkey sick of them
I wish buzzfeed drunk vids were exclusively a Kelsey thing...cause the drunk Try Guys are annoying AF. 
There, I said it. Come at me..

But Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are the same company...
i love them so much it hurts haha
yo quiero TACO BELL
Ned is such a sloppy drunk and I don't know why this came as a surprise.

i just dont understand... how can drunk people not do simple tasks?
please does anyone know what "Nick's Quick Pick" fried chicken place is.... if not .... shame IT IS THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN PLACE EEVERRRRRRR

They should do the same food test but sober to see if their opinions change
Soft and neat.
3:50 I literally died laughing :)
I USED TO HAVE LOYALTY

you should make a video called "Dear chubbs" chubbs is a youtuber.
what video are they talking about in the beginning?
Aww~ such a cute tiny Zach.
Why are they always drunk in Buzzfeed?
this is the best video I've seen in a long time
"No one wants to see that Zach" I do. I want to see that Zach ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

The best guys to watch on YouTube.
I wish I had friends like them they seem to always have fun
4:21 Mute it and then repeatedly sing "La la  la!" It's magical
HAHAH I think I was secondhand drunk watching this.
okay but have you ever tried the Whataburger honey butter chicken biscuit?? 🙏🙌🤠👌
😂😂😂😂😂😂
suuuuuire, they hae it hard. in great Britannia we dont have taco bell
No ones gonna talk about the fact Eugene started crying talking about taco bell
Gaaaayyyyy
Gaaaayyyyy
i just realized that zack and keith look a little alike
Eugene: i can eat a whole pizza drunk by myself



I can do that sober😪.
Whenever I see or hear KFC I'll go "La la la!"
At the end of the day the real winner is papa johns LALALA
hello
' la la la ' 😂😂😂😂❤❤
I prefer Popeyes to KFC though; it might just be that where I live, KFC's chicken is always super dry?

Awkward moment when you can eat a large Pizza Hut pizza by yourself in 30 minutes when sober. Sorry. 

Also I'm surprised they didn't order a taco pizza from Pizza Hut.

Of course I am watching a try guys marathon and the minute I decide to take a shower they upload again
Am I the only person who doesn't like pizza
I have Emetophobia (fear of vomit) please put a warning of vomit on your titles. The intro gave me a major panic attack.
I feel as the try guys series got increasingly monetized it kind of lost its charm.
I LOVE THIS VIDEO
this video is complete cancer
When you see ugene in the thumbnail
WHAT'RE WE DOING !?😂
4 flamers in an eventual ending career eat food.
3:19 IM DEAD😂😂😂😂
fun fact: kfc, taco bell, & pizza hut are owned by the same company
"Burger king is a burger king not a fry lord" best quote of 2017
I was waiting for Keith to put the whole burger in his mouth.
the try guys are amazing
Favorite video from Buzzfeed so far
Why do they all turn gay when drunk
Who came here straight after the new worth it episode?
i think i have a crush on eugene 😂

totally staged and scripted
Keith's Face when he found out there is no Sauce!

"WHat are we doing?"
"WhAt ae we doing?"
They don't look that drunk
TRY GUYS PLEASE BE MY FRIENDS OH MY LAWD I LOVE YOU GUYSSS

Eugene having a life crisis after liking taco bell was hilarious 🤣
Watching this as I poop 💩
Its April fools where is the "April fools" video
I LOVE EUGENE
They should do a what food taste better cold
I JUST REALIZED THIS WAS POSTED TODAY WHEN I WAS ON A TRY GUYS BINGE
did anyone else notice that they kept changing partners to sit next to?
They must've gotten a crappy Popeyes
I love these guys so much!! Especially Zach
358th!

"McDonald's McDonald's Kentucky Fried chicken and a Pizza Hut" 🎤
Eugene looks so ashamed to like taco bell hahahah
OMG KEITH AND ZACH, I LOVE YOU!!1
wildt
0:59 is the best thing i will see on youtube today
wtf is this
The Whopper King Place... Now I want a shirt that says that...
110% sure Ned was high
Soft. and. Neat.
Ew KFC is so basic compared to Popeyes....
KFC isn't vegetarian :(
Eugene is extra sassy when drunk. I didn't know Eugene can get hotter
Hi, I have no life, can I get a 1000 likes?
KFC stands for Killing Fricken Chickens
These idiots make me so happy
That "Olivia Newton John Travolta" comment had me dying.
😂
"La La La..."
Why did they choose to give them the worst thing from Taco Bell? They should have gave them a Cheesy Gordita Crunch instead
You should re do the high heels video but the try guys should be drunk
Never had Popeyes because they don't have it here in the UK 😯
Are you sure they're drunk and not stoned lmao
SOFT AND NEAT
I've never had Popeyes 😬 or Taco Bell 😅
S O F T  A N D  N E A T
They still act like that without being drunk lol
This might be THE BEST video ever
Not sure if April Fools or just normal video...
they're the winners because they get to eat all that delicious food
"Ronald's my neighbor." - Eugene
I've never wanted to be Ronald McDonald this much in my life.
Roses are red
My Name is Dave
This poem makes no sense
Microwave
...but I don't have enough friends.
soft & neat
KFC should hire Keith for their jingle
I'm really wondering how drunk they are or if it's just them
😂😂😂
I'm pretty sure before the year is up there will be a "The Try Guys Try Sodomy" video...
Potato stamps
Keith is me whenever I eat food... (not drunk lmao)
Wow this is funny asf
Eugene is so selfloving. It's disgusting.
Did anybody notice that they switched parateners in the last round
I wish I can do this. But I'm still young.
Tell me how Eugene can be attractive no matter what state he's in
OH MY GOD KEITH
"burger hamburger at the whopper king place"
Kfc makes me sick and my cousin told me what is in their chicken she worked there. I was disgusted.
GMM again, Holyshit stop!!!!!! 
ps. SOFT AND NEAT
Eugene is genuinely sad that he likes taco bell when he's drunk😂😂
I see the try guys in my nightmares sometimes. Then I wake up and cry and go back to sleep
Keith's fry thighs save lives.
And now im hungry
K - Keith's
F - LOVES
C - CHICKEN

♡the try guys
who else freaks out whenever a new try guys video comes out?
I haven't seen cool ranch taco shell here in Chicago here anymore.
OH MAY GAH
Drunk Ned and drunk me are one in the same 😂
when Keith found out there was no sauce. 😂
SOFT AND NEAT
I'd rather be high than drunk any day. In which case pizza always wins.
"Don't eat without me motherfucka" I died laughing 😂
I loved this so much HAHAHAH
HOW DID THEY CHOOSE KFC OVER POPEYES MY SOUL HURTS
I don't need friends to order all of that >.>
Omg drunk eating is the best lol
ew kfc
But there's not a Whataburger in California... Sad day for them.
Didn't realize this was new
Wow.
I hate how gay this is
considering getting youtube red just for these guys
Keith had a crisis over sauce.
KFC LA LA LA
why do they all seem gay for straight men?
They always brighten up my day.
And make me want to go and buy alcohol.
But mostly brighten up my day.
Eugene is literally the best thing ever
Lalala
hi
Kfc is hands down my fav fast food,
Keith and i are on the same lane
The quick transitions in this video make me dizzy 😵
I lost it as soon as Ned asked where the Doritos where 😂
'But the burger hamburger at the whopper king place' lmfao
They need their own tv show
HELLO
hi
The Try Guys should try sky diving
Can someone explain to me what Eugene means at 2:16 in the video about the names
Like If Try Guys shouldn't go Red
just a random person scrolling through the comments
omllll
had to repeat this so many times to remember that they're actually drunk😂 especially Eugene!
SOFT AND NEAT
They are all gay I think
It's fun to see people drunk 😵
I really want to see the try guys try weed
I have never had kfc before but know i will:)

"Don't eat without me motherf*cker!" Eugene is me there. lol
At 4:13 Zach sounds just like Charlie Day!!
Why is there no straight males in any of these videos
Happy April fools every body!!!
"Ronald's my neighbor."
Oh now I want KFC
Ooh a new Try Guys video!! *sees the 7 minutes ago* dang it
5:24 I love that they've shown Adam, that too in a creepy way XD
Eugene and Zack are such polar opposite drunks.
who thinks they are uploading many videos in only one day
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY CHOSE KFC OVER POPEYES?????
All of them drunk is my personality sober. This is amazing lmao
Well I know what I'm going to do tonight!
