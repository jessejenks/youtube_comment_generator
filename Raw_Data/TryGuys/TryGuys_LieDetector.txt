Eugene is the only one that told the truth in all this
8:19 John is not amused
Question I wished they asked:
"Who do you think is the best try guy?"
Its not a toy!
God hates liars and I hate liars.... Guys intense!!
when Ned said "I don't know those babies" I almost died laughing 😂😂😂
Eugene is the best try guy . Not keith or zackh
I lied somewhere in this sentence.
it said porn diddy instead of korndiddy on cc
Hey guys💗I'm new to YouTube as I made my account today😊I have 0 subscribers at the moment, I'm not one of those scam comments looking for subscribers but I would appreciate it if you could help by subscribing or even liking this comment!😅Have a lovely day, and remember YOU are beautiful❤️
Try Guys try BTS! They should do something with BTS. I almost don't care what. I just love Bangtan too much.
"I'll kill you right here " ( never mess with John )
The old guy looked like he really didnt want to be there....
anyone nows what happend with the try guys????
Awww Ned, I have a problem controlling my volume too! It's all good xD
Keith is so cute <3
haha is this guy low-key famous?
omg he killed the babies!
this is absolutely my favourite Try Guys episode
john: "i hate liars"
dude looks like he hates everything
I actually love Keith
I like nuns... and actually a lot of them are pretty young
Why is John my spirit animal?😂😂😂
Ned: Yeah, I suppose I have a better marriage then John...I mean, he's older, and marriage's tend to get harder as people get older...
Try Guys: "Laughing and spinning around hysterically"
John: "Slowly turns head around" I'll kill you right here.
God hates laughter and I hate laughter
i l l k i l l y o u r i g h t h e r e
"I don't know those babies" - ned
LMAO!!
Ned:I don't know those babies. 
Me: dies from laughter!

Zach:do u ever want kids? 
Eugene: yea
John:he's telling the truth
Keith: wow thought u hated little kiddies?
Me: silently does from laughter!
I love them so much 😂😂😍
Do you think that you'll ever answer a yes or no question with yes or no?  well you see... 
That's me in a but shell
Who lied the most?
Ned" i dont know those babys"
Zack: Eugene, do you know how much the three of us care about you?
Eugene: No.
John: He's telling the truth.
Keith: We gotta be better about that.

That really broke my heart.
Conspiracy Theory: Zack is The Duckman (AKA Duckie from Pretty In Pink) All grown up, and still depressed that Andie chose Blane over him... 😮😉
do you kill the italian baby boat? good ned.
"i'd kill u right here."
every time u learn more about eugene u start crying and now im crying!
"I'd kill her" OMG hahhahah this guy is 100.
Thats john from ADD
I noticed they haven't been posting videos for like 3 weeks.. did I miss something that happened?
Lie detectors do not work rofl
Eugene deserves true love everyone!!!!
when eugene said he doesn't belive in true love it seriously think a little bit of my heart broke
THE TRY GUYS TRY PAINTBALL
It has been said many times that polygraph is not trustworthy
Eugene is hot.
I ADMIT I GOT A BONER AT THE MALE STRIPING VIDEO
the try guys try break dancing classes
They look like Mormons, interigating someone about the goodnews
John is amazing.
the only thing less legitimate than a polygraph is buzzfeed as a source of news
This may not be true but I heard polygraphs don't work... 
they measure sweat and heartbeat... nervous people aren't always liars
The try guys need their own channel like ladylike
I so like unjune is just like me they also only like me for my hair
Wow!
I can't be the only one who has a crush on like 100 buzzfeed employees
John is HILARIOUS.
This made my day!!! :,)
DO you think it's weird?
No
Well it is
try guys try pressure washing
I wonder which three co workers he made out with......
Johns depressing
God hates liars
he hates liars...

therefore this man is god
I got an add for the lie detector test WHILE watching this! Like you sent me an add for the video i was watching!
This is not a real polygraph. You can not move at all.
The try guys try lasertag!!!! I want to see there ninja moves!
LOL John is hilarious
i like cina town
john 🤣😂
the guys alternately: who's your favorite try guy?

me: can i say john..?
is that the lie detector guy from Nathan For You?
I just wonder how long has Zach been single 🤔
Try guys' expectations: 
fried chicken > keith's fiancee
the guy only said keiths name
"I'll kill you right here"
lmfao polygraphs are basically a pseudoscience at this point given the huge amount of variables and general likelihood of error
ugene is really cute and hot  is that weird that I like him !
''ill kill her'' hahaha old people XDD
The computer guy is so creepy
do you think u talk too much? well, when u put it that way...
Lying makes you go to hell-dan
my mum divorced twice
Well it's about heart beat and pulses so if you can control yourself you could lie to lie detector
That part when he said "I don't know those babys" 😂😂😂
I thought this was going to be boring. I couldn't stop laughing 😂
Ned looking like the grinch when he answers
they should try sky diving
N: "Eugene do you know how much the three of us care about you?"
E: "no"
Keith in the background: "damn..." 
was telling the truth
Keith in the background again: "we need to be better about that...."

My tiny cold heart just shattered Keith sounded so genuinely sorry like tell me this man isn't the sweetest most caring human being out there 😢
Zach: Do you secretly think Ned and his wife are going to get divorced someday?
Eugene: What, no. 
Ned: What? Of course he does. 

The fact that Ned is not only aware of this but is absolutely chill and unoffended by it is kinda cute? He's that secure in his relationship and/or that chill with Eugene.
Is it just me or is John creepy
I love how they all gasp when Ted says that he fakes things with his wife, and how they say "wowwww" when Keith says he would give up fried chicken forever 😂😂😂
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."

Who DOESNT hate liars?
I just took a polygraph last week for one of my labs-- it's kind of cool to see this and actually understand what is being measured and why they use those measurements. I also confirmed that even being asked a question/me answering brought on a higher heart and respiratory rate. My galvanic skin response was extremely accurate in determining if I was lying or not (which makes a lot of sense!)
"I'd kill her" ~ John
But lie detectors don't work. At all. It's pseudoscience, and bad pseudoscience at that. You can take classes on how to beat them, which don't take long. :/

http://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph.aspx
John is a god
Volume context tendency trail locate with dawn raw wind reluctant ride
"eugene, do you know how much the three of us care about you?"
"no"
"he's yelling the truth"
"dang we gotta be better than that"

that broke my heart
More try guy videos please
I wished they had asked Ned if he could save his wife or them who would he choose?
When is the next video posting???
I actually think that marriage gets better when they get older
try hair modelling
The try guys should get their iq done
why do the rest of the Try Guys think that Zach will forever be single? Zach is so cute!!! if I were old enough to be with him, I would. who else agrees with me that Zach is the adorable one in the group?
i need try guys more more and more
John is HARDCORE!
keith is the best try guy
How many guys would screw Eugene starting with me 😂😂😁
When Eugene said that divorce jacks up your brain I instantly thought yes. Yes it does.
"i'll kill you right here"

"Everything's a toy if you play with it"
Low key feel bad for John he just looked like he really didn't wanna be there
I'm with Eugene on the whole I don't believe in true love either my parents are divorced too.
Try guys try gay sex
Is anyone else scared by John
John is super scary ....... I think he is super suuupppeeerrr scccaaarryyy . Who else
John should be on the try guys, he was the funniest one
try guys go hunting
john is creepy af
Keith. You call me if and when it doesn't work out with your girlfriend.
The bad thing is that I'm with Eugene on the divorced wuestion
I mean Kieth is the favorite for the other try guys. And also "I don't know those babies"
8:13 😂😂😂😂
"Everything is a toy if you play with it"
John seems so dark and full of secrets I'm scared
I want the tryguys to play escape room like if you agree
what if john is lying 😈
"is some of it just for show"
"yeah, sure"
I FEEL ALMOST BETRAYED
Does anyone think John is a bit scary???
OK I LOVE THIS BUT DID JOHN REMIND ANYONE ELSE OF RON SWANSON???
I would not want to be hooked up to one of those machines, I would be really scared and I would be crying.😱😭
Eugene: "Would you kill the Italian baby boat, Ned?"
Ned: "Yes!"
Eugene: "Good man!"
Zach: "You psycho, don't applaud him!"
Had me laughing so much! XD
IDK WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME EVERY TIME I SEE EUGENE MY HEART EXPLODES CAUSE I LOVE HIM BUT IN THIS VIDEO I LOVE HIM EVEN MORE HE'S SO ATTRACTIVE AND MYSTERIOUS YET HONEST I'M CRYING I'M WEAK SEND HELP.
"We had to use the psychic."
Everybody Jon is god
You guys should try skateboarding
WHY ISN'T THE TRY GUYS UPLOADING ANY VIDEOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AHHAHAHA
A polygraph is not a lie detector, but rather an expensive toy. The polygraph measures heart beat and breathing, not lies. People can be calm and pass the polygraph test, there are even classes for it. This is video is filled with lies!
Can I get a like for john
But God doesn't hate anyone
All of them like Keith the most but he likes Zach
Omg everyone said Keath
John the sassy man! He is great.
Oh my god this is hilarious
eugiene is sooo hot
Nobody likes Nuns, Eugene
"I don't know those babies"
when will they post again?
This is kinda creep
JOHN'S SERIOUSNESS IM CRYING "IF SOMEONE'S LYING I WILL LET YOU KNOW"
No one is gonna mention "Adam ruins everything" ? i mean, he pretty much took a dump on the lie detector.
who wants to andrew to join the try guys
"We need a black member"
John: "I'd kill her."
That old guy look so angry....
Please do more guys! That was the funniest thing I've seen in months really made me laugh! You guys are amazing
This is it.

Wife's.

Ned
Keith
Eugene
And then Zack.
Sorry Zack
polygraph test don't work.....all you have to do to beat the test is to stay super chill and keep your heart rate down....criminals do it all the time..
6:47 stay with someone who looks at you like Eugene looks at Zach 😂😍❤
this is the best out of all of the buzzfeed lie detector videos
Polygraphs don't actually tell if your lying
This is literally the best YouTube video the try guys ever filmed
Anyone else immediately think of the lie detector episode of Adam Ruins Everything when they saw the title?
John:God hates liars and I hate liars
Me: WAIT, ARE U GOD THEN!!!
my ned and Ariel relationship goals are almost gone because of this video
GOD HATES LYERS, HE HATES LYERS SO THAT MEANS....






HE IS GOD!!
These lie detector dudes are so dry lol
ZACH ATTACK
When his wife's name is Ariel and yours is too
I can't take my eyes off of Eugene's hair.
Has anybody mentioned this? IT'S SO SWEET OF KEITH!!!

Zach: Do you know how much the three of us care about you?
Eugene: No.
Lie detector dude: He's telling the truth.
Keith: We have to be better at that.

So much love for this four. If you guys still make videos until you're old I will still definitely watch you guys. :(( #TryGuysFanForLyf
react to so hyang arirang alone please!!!!!!!
"I'll kill you right here.... I'll kill her."
y'all should do GISHWES! It's a scavenger hunt by Misha Collins and y'all could be a team and do all the crazy hilarious stuff. Plus your views would skyrocket cause all the supernatural fans would want to see someone do gishwhes. It would be great!
Ned looks like William Lyon Mackenzie King on the canadian 50 dollar note. Just saying.
JOHN (lie detector guy) SMILED ON 1:16
Videos like this might just save buzzfeed. 10/10 entertainment.
I love john.
Eugene is so chill about telling the world and the Try Guys about personal secrets that might as well be better off not knowing
WHY DOES NOBODY BELIEVE ZACH WILL FIND LOVE I WOULD MARRY HIM SO FAST
HOW COULD ANYONE NOT LOVE BEANIE!
No offense but John is kind of scary
Eugene is the most truthful Try Guy!

I'm not a Eugene stan by any means, but I do like that about him.
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn Ned...lookin' GOOD!
I love John
Anyone else thinking that the lie detector dude is hating them for lying a lot?
"I'll kill you right here" 😂😂😂
"God hates liars and I hate liars" Liar.
who hurt john, why is john hurt
do they upload a new video every week?
Why does Zach remind me of Jim Moriarty from Sherlock?
Loooove the setup and the dress code, the whole 'overworked cop' thing. Awesome.
okay, i get it, ned's inlove with his wife. but you kill babies? really? i mean i guess if ariel couldn't swim then it would be okay to save her because newborns naturally know how to swim since they're like swimming in the womb but i think she does know how to swim
"GOD HATES LIARS AND I HATE LIARS"
3:52 where he talks about being a child of divorce and not believing in true love it hurt my heart cause I feel the same way and I'm a child of divorce
The try guys try joking a marching band!!
The dude at the computer sounds so sad..
John is my new favorite Try Guy.
TRY GUYS TRY SKYDIVING
I will kill you right now
That guy literally dosent have a personality...
God doesn't hate liars in fact he loves liars but hates sin.
wait did Eugene fill in his eyebrows?
"Ned, you and Ariel are so cute together. is any of it just for show?". when Keith asked that Ned looked like he immediately regretted being there
Being Italian I got triggered when he said he'd kill the Italian babies XDDDD
I don't know why, but I think it would be really interesting to see them try musical theatre
Zach is adorable ❤
I need this with Ryan and Shane
I'm scared of John.
The sadness in Keith's face is priceless when zach asked "Fried chicken or Becky and he said I give up fried chicken"
After this video john went to jail for threatening Ned. I miss john...
" god hates livers and I hates liers "
So Keith begins to swear...
this was kinda awesome
Ok but real talk Eugene looks damn good in that shirt with his tie all lose
just when i thought eugene's cold-blooded attitude was just a front.. it's actually real wtf
THIS IS FKING AMAZING
i'd really like to do this just to find out if i want kids or not because honestly who knows
That dude was scary af
lmaooo "I'd kill her"
I'm sure the examiner is a crazy party guy.
This is by far the best try guys video
i love john the dude
When Eugene said he doesn't believe in true love, Zach was everybody watching the video.
took a buzzfeed break, and thank god the try guys are still here <3
oh he is sweating because hes nervous lie
"God hates liars and I hate liars." bahahaha. Best sentence in this whole damn video.
Man, seeing Eugene be so open about his insecurities makes me want to hug the doubts out of him.
"I dont need your explanations"
"Everything is a toy if you play with it", does that mean my wang is a toy?
We need to ask homophobes and crazy feminists some questions with this thing
next on the try guys, trying to figure out eugene's back story
8:33: "id kill her" IM UGJVI
same eugene, same
They should try a prostate manage
that dude is scary af
5:19 my ship has sailed
Ask questions, change your outfit, ask a new, change again and so on...
So.. how long will it be until the try guys are replaced with other men?
why is he so grumpy
this is a show about gay guys experimenting or bi curious guys trying gay acts?
try guys skydive
"I'll kill you right here" wtf dude?! I'm dying!
"I don't know those babies"
I absolutely LOVE The Try Guys! I personally think it would be great if they did an episode where they create their own origin stories where they combine elements of their own backstories with special powers/abilities they wish they had, and then act it out. The Try-vengers. Just sayin.
I love that lie detector guy!
Buzzfeed is stage 5 CANCER
lie detectors don't even work.
John is my new favorite
Every Try Guys comment section: EUUUUUGGGGGGEEEEEEENNNNNNEEEEEE
"I will kill you right here" I'M CRYING THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVER
" I don't know those baby's" 😂
"His telling the truth" more like i am groot
Try guys try band camp or marching band! Please buzzfeed I'm begging
Zach is so cute 😩😭
TRY GUYS TRY HORSE RIDING!!!!!!!
Omllllll 😂
This is the same Lie Detector Guy used in Rupaul's Drag Race (season 4). I know this by pure coincidence.
I love Keith too
Hey buzzfeed, why can't the try guys be gals?
He hates liars god hates liars is he god?
John is so creepy
Zach: Do you know how much we really care about you?
Eugene: No
Lie detector guy: He's telling the truth 
Me: crying 
Keith: we gotta be better at that
Me: more crying
eagean is so hot
This is one of the best videos I have ever randomly stumbled upon.
Guys! This is the same John that administered the lie detector test during the Frenemies episode in season 4 of Drag Race!
I'd kill her
"If you ask me a direct question, I will give you a direct answer."
"Do you like being single?"
"Well- ahhh.."
"I will kill you right now"
7:29 broke my freakin heart.
I don't need your explenations haha caught me off gaurd lmao
john is intense
these things are a total hoax scam ruins every thing explained so
Keith's "We gotta be better about that." is so honest and sweet
WTF!?(I'm Italian) I feel offended.
jonh scares me
this is gonna be the start of so many fanfics
So when is Eugene going to start his own channel?
i died when the guy on the computer said "ill kill you right now"
this is one of the best videos of Buzzfeed
I volunteer to have Eugene's babies. Nah, jk.
"I will kill you right here"
I love how there wearing suits.
The try guys ; haunted house
Yeah that was great i like being hooked up to machines lmao
John needs to be here all the time i swear 😂😂😂😂
"God hates liars. I hate liars."
"I'll kill you right here"
"I'd kill her"
"It's not a toy"
Zach: Well, I mean, anything is a toy if you play with it
I ship Zach and Eugene so hard!😍
None of this is true especially the lie of the lie detector working
Eugene: "That was great. I like being hooked up to machines."

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
John is scary
Please have the Try Guys watch a BTS music video and let them try to do the calligraphy!
"We need to be better about that" – said the others when Eugene said he doesn't know how much they care about him.


What true friendship.
Am I alone in thinking that it's adorable that Keith is everyone's favorite?
Pre teen girls dress the try guys for a week
does anyone else think this is kind of false? i mean the polygraph test has no real scientific backing, the readings from the machine are just heart rate blood pressure perspiration, etc. but none of those things are actually indicative of lying, someone could just be nervous about being interrogated and be caught by the machine. humans are complex creatures and their reaction to various things may be entirely subjective and arent actually objectively defined by anything that machine detects lol.
hey
4:31 we should have a black member quick edit lie!
it's my favorite when zach giggles...
Does the lie detector guy have any emotion? 😂
eugene. are you gay because that would be amazing lol cuz your sexy asf
Ned: would you rather save your wife, or a boat full of orphans?
John: I'll kill her.
John didn't change expression once.
The lie detector guy could survive a whole life of being a bus driver
John is my favorite try guy
"I thought you hated little kiddies" BWWHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." - Zach on life 😂😂😂
"I assume so, I don't know."
"I'll kill you right here."

"If you could save a boat of orphans or your wife which would you choose?"
"I'd kill her."
Me: dying
I don't understand why Eugene feels so insecure about himself, he's hot and funny
lying makes you go to hell
Lie detectors are not true there not 100 percent accurate.
Buzzkill John!!
He don't know them babies😂
Please have the Try guys do an escape room!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They should try bunjee jumping from a bridge. I wanna see Zach squiggle while driving there. 😂
Too bad lie detectors are pseudo-science
I was waiting for EUGENE.  He is my FAV.
"Nobody likes nuns, Eugene. I grew up catholic."- Ned 2017
Someone needs to hug Eugene. He doesnt like them i know, but still.
God hates lies and I hate lies 

Me: I figured it out he is God
Am I the only one that attracted to Eugene's veins... ? I mean... ... ...
I had to pause the video in order to like it so that I don't forget DAMN IT this is hilarious 😂😂
Eugene is most definitely a sociopath
One of the best of the try guys :)
"I thought you hated little kiddies"
I wonder usually these machine detect your heart rates and see if you lie or not so can you reverse psychology the machine so it think that you are lying but in fact you are telling the truth 
Like if someone ask me if I hate that person I will leaning to saying no to make my heart rates go high and then say yes so the machine think that I am lying but in fact I am not lying
That Pop And That Donut
eugene is such a sweetheart! we must protect him at all costs
eugene always being dark asf
Jon is a savage at the end lol
Euguine " I have many secrets " 


This man killed someone
Its been proven time and time again that lie detectors don't work a lot of the time. Even the slightest things can make it so you seem like you're lying. There have been so many people wrong fully convicted, or people not convicted, just because of a detector test. I've heard that police also know how defective the test can actually be but still chose to use it because it intimidates people.
I don't know those babies😂
"Do you know how much we care about you?" "...No" "He's telling the truth" "We gotta be better at that" </3 I'm so heartbroken. The way that Keith just,,,, he's so sad in that moment and it kills me. Eugene hunny they love you
Waiting for a "why I left BuzzFeed" video from one of them..
It's actually really easy to not get caught on these things you just have yo chill out and say it
Is Ned married?
One of the funniest videos of buzzfeed I've ever watched
Same Eugene I'm a child of divorce
"I'd cold blood murder the nuns." 
Me
Wow John seems like such a sweet person
John is a grumpy gus
they're hot in suits
WAIT!!?? WOW? ARENT LIE DETECTOR TEST A LIE ITSELF AND VERY UNRELIABLE? AND MOSTLY READ OF PEOPLES NERVOUSENESS
If you are stressed by the pressure of the lie detector, it makes it a lie because people get stressed
Why do I like watching these videos?
keith's the best <3
I love these guys and Keith is my all time favorite! (:
Try guys try roller derby!!
half expected keith to say keith was his favourite try guy tbh
"i'll kill you right here" 😂 this man needs a youtube channel, id watch it religiously 😂😂😂😂😂
The polygraph test cant tell if ur lying, the guy who made the machine said it himself
I like John.
lie detectors don't work at all lmao
please make try guys videos very frequently
they all look like the same person except the hot one
I don't like to lie
Try Guys Try Horseback Riding
They're trying to be ADD lol (they even got John)
'I'd kill her' 
Savage
By far, Eugene came up with the weirdest questions to ask 😂
2:06 Morman meeting.
i am falling in love with zach ngl
John should be on try guys🤔🤔
"Dammit, I KNEW THEY WENT SOMEWHERE!" - Ned,  2017
I love how the lie ditector dude was so calm and chill XD
Maybe you could go to Czech Republic and try Bear .There is a pub almost everywhere because Czechs drink the most bear in the world. And we make the best bear like Pilsner Urquel , Gambrinus and so on. There are so many bear manufacturers that in every shop they reserve gigantic whole section just for all the bear.
see my great videos in my channel
John looks like he hates his job.
Anyone: Do you think you'll be alone forever?

Me: Yes. No doubt. 


John: She's telling the truth
i'll show you love & care eugene. 😘
I wish they asked Eugene if he's gay
Ned:have you ever stolen anything from us
Zach: a pen
What I thought neds wife
LIE DETECTORS DON'T WORK
Can u please do the try guys try all the Australian tim tams? Or the try guys try surfing and sailing!
Itstso obvious he's just making up results for comedic results
Eugene is the Rosa Dias of The Try Guys
Eugene is not a liar
I prefer the give it a whirl fuckers
I love the way the guy on the right talks
PSA: polygraphs don't actually detect lies, they detect physiological changes in the body, such as blood pressure and heartbeat, factors that are associated with the stress behind lying. Everyone is different in their bodily reactions, so it is not an absolute answer about if they're being truthful or not. It would be more accurate to say lie detectors actually just detect emotion.
You guys should do "The Try Guys spend a day in jail!!!!"😄😄😄😄 if they'd allow that😳 lol
do they now that dousnt work you can do cordo and get lies
Hi I'm in the break up marriage life with my mom and dad!!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"
john is awesome ! 😂😂😂
you know what the try guys should do... read fanfiction about themselves. like if you agree😂
Woot this was published on my birthday
Its okay eugene im a child of divorce too and i realise they usually i cant tell How much a person actually cares about me
Love the try guys so muchhh,i want more videos of the try guys 😍
We love you John <3
i love these guys.
Maybe Eugene just want's to have sex with himself haha.  Like Carbon Copy XD
John from ADD!!!!
Eugene looks like josh dun from Twenty One Pilots........................
that guy scares me
Subjective questions are pointless in a lie detector test. Opinion is neither truth nor untruth.
Bruh John concerns me
God, I wanna see a Eugene/ Zack fanfic.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."
lmao John what
Is there any way I can subscribe to just the try guy videos? I'm subscribed to buzzfeed but I don't pay attention when they post videos because most of it is trash so I end up seeing try guy videos like a week late all the time.
John is scary when he threatens people with a staight face 'i'd kill you right there' (._.) John- 2017
Lmfao "I will kill you right here"
Keith got so sad about the possibility of giving up fried chicken!
"I'll kill you"
Do you like school?
Yes 
Telling the truth

Do you do your homework
.. Y-yes
LIES
Polygraphs aren't actually all that accurate.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars" + his face + the creepy music = I shat myself.
Why is no one commenting about Keith wanting to see how many penises he can fit in his mouth? lol
Lie detectors are such bs
John is weird
KEITH LOVES HIS FIANCE MORE THAN CHICKEN OMG I BELIEVE IN LOVE
the try guys should get there own channel
The Try Guys try Drugs.
Hitler did nothing wrong, wake up and learn the truth!
OMG I love this.  John is amazing  :)
You guys are interrogators lol
this reminded me of the Dolan Twins haha
At 1.17 You can see that John is trying really hard not to laugh, haha.
the guy who's working  the machine though😂😂
The Benny hill show
JOHN IS SO CUTE
John is also on ADD, what a traitor.
I dont like john....
the polygraph doesn't actually work. That's why it's so ridiculously we still use it
Another psudo-science reinforced by humor. No scientific explaination, just gags.
6:54 Same here Eugene :,)
john scares me
I have not laughed this hard in a long time 😂
John reminds me of Ron Swanson-
I'm seriously concerned about johns metal state
John works at all def digital too
at the end thooo ned... "well everythings a toy if you play with it" <3
ned ned ned ned ned ned is soooo cuteee...except his namee
The lie tetector guy is very very creepy
Polygraphs are completely fake
5:22 😂😂
"I'd kill the nuns" me....if I was married....forever alone
John is god
Look at Keith's face at 3:58😂😂😂😂
Zach is soo cute
I have never cringed so hard...
Everything is a toy if you play with it 😂😂
Zach and I are the same person
I'm Eugene
anyone else giggling throughout the whole video?? xD
Did any of you guys realize that The lie detector man... guy... person... person didn't laugh through any of this? XD
Can John be the new Try Guy?
Zach: do you think I'm ever going to find love?
Keith: yeah.
John: Keith is lying.
dont worrie eugene haha i wanna fuk ned haha
haahha that was lit asf xD
John is scary
Try guys- oh no Ned mentioned his wife 
Comments- Ned talks about his wife so much
Me- well he dose love her but it must get annoying 
Try guys- asks Ned about his wife almost every time
Me- 😔😔 face slap
he was on the real
Did Adam already ruin polygraph tests
I know these polygraph test are usually inaccurate but they're still fun
DO THIS AGAIN
The examiner kinda looks like my bus driver 😂😂
i want for them to ask ned if he was skared of being not the only married one
HAHA they all go WOW when Keith would give up fried chicken for his girl lol
This got me nervous.
I relate to Eugene a little too much I think
I spit out my soda
I actually hardcore ship Eugene and Zach now, whoops.
Ned looks different somehow!
This is the day I started shipping Eugene and Zach.
god hates liars and he hates liars
conclusion: he is God 
hahahhahaha :)
John:God Hates Liars,And I Hate liars...*thinks in is head "I AM GOD!!!😂😂"
Try guys should try an ice skating contest, both beauty and grace!!!
who else doesn't like John?
Hi buzfeed if you do read this then I would be happy as anything and all I just wanna say is that iam one of your number one fans and I watch all of your vid
(And on every channel ) iam not a stalker it is just that you make my day when I fell down and I hope I get to meet you which I can't becuase I live in England :((
John is my spirt animal
i am a child of divorce.
look how serious the guy was when he said "God hates liars."
I just started ROFLing halfway through...
Why is john so imitating😂
why are they called try guys?
Glad to see this being done for entertainment purposes only, but lie detectors have little to no accuracy. Most of the questions anyone can tell were lies or truths from the body language and tone of the conversation. Wishing that this piece of pseudoscience would disappear.
This is what I don't get. What if the guy doesn't know? Would the 'information" or 'pulse' be useless and unable to get anything from it?
"god hates liars and i hate liars"
THIS IS SO FUNNY
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"
squints eyes
I thoroughly enjoyed this video. I might subscribe. Actually, I think I will.
Keith looks so sad about how much he loves Becky after the chicken question
the one guy on the computer doesn't look up ONCE 😂😂
"Have you ever just hooked yourself up to one of these and just like asked yourself questions in the mirror and see what you truly believe?"

"It's not a toy" 

"Well...everything's a toy if you play with it"
John looks chronically depressed someone check on my buddy.
"Who's your favorite try guy?" 
"Keith"
"Keith"
"Keith" 
😂😂😂😂😂
"For sexual sake?" "No..." "Keith is lying." "Damnit." LOL.

You're adorable Keith. Eugene got it. AIN'T NOTHIN' WRONG WITH IT. <3
"I don't know those babies."
So is the polygraph guy god?
Actually lie detectors have been proven to be inaccurate they seriously should not be in use anymore.
So Eugene believes in ghosts but not love. ...okay. His mother was weaned on the teat of the town psychic so yeah she is potentially psychic. ...what!?! He's so A Clockwork Orange.
lmao zach's flourish with the lollipop during the fried chicken question gets me every time XD
7:30 Keith doesn't like Ned Stark?
The best teams on buzzfeed:
 Try guys
Buzzfeed unsolved investigaters.
I feel like John was actually pissed at ned for saying his marriage was better because they were young...   :I
this is such a fun video!
John is so funny XD
i really wanna try this with my friends
Keith I don't know there's a difference with being confident and being arrogant
John, a man of very few words 😂
quick question: could John have been any more miserable? XD omg that is not what he wanted to be doing lmfao
Lie detector tests aren't even real, buzzfeed cmon
I've never laughed this much watching youtube before
I'm telling your wife john!
Plz Do The Try Guys Try Swedish Candy!!!!!
Question to ask them: Are you racist assholes? Oh yeah, you dont even need a lie detector for that one, we all already know the answer to it.
Lie Detectors are just based on your heart rate going up when you are nervous about the question.
Keith IS the best Try Guy!
Ne... They should bring the Lightman Group.
ok
"Dog hates liars" -John 2017
ned:I don't know those babies
I Laugh So Hard When John Said I'm Going Kill You(Ned) Right Now! My Mind:John Is Telling The Truth
john seems like a psycho
could be gayer
Does anyone else think Zach looks like Idubbbz?
Wow, those guys have been doing videos together for 2 years.
But Eugene still doesn't know how much the three care about him?
That's really sad.
Lie detectors don't work
lie detector tests do not work, serial killers have passed them and plants have failed them
God dosnt hate liars he hates lies
the try guys try wipeout
I swear to Christ this is the same guy who conducted the lie detector tests on Flavor Of Love S1 :O
oh my god... Ned is an inch away from crying from the marriage questions
'everything is a toy, if you play with it' - The Try Guys
God hates liars, and I hate liars. Therefore, I am God.
Did you know that polygraphs don't work as lie detectors.
Keith is best try guy.
The lie detector actually doesn't look at whether or not you tell a lie or not rather it looks at your heightened galvanic skin responses, I learned that in forensics these dip shits would never know that.
John sweetie, who hurt you?
So if you could vote 1 person out of the try guys team, who would it be?
Lie detectors are inaccurate
MOST IMPORTANT COMMENT YOU'LL READ:
Eugene didn't see Ned when he asked him the question (you know the one) so 
1. It was easier to lie undetected 
2. He didn't recognize the voice or thought it was zack.
3. Eugene also prepared himself for that question to be calm and hence how he passed.

Nedgeners you can rest assured
arent nuns catholic im pretty sure they are
Eugene is the best try guy, but let's not forget it.
very very personal questions: YOU THINK YOUR BETTER THAN ME!!!
At 9:05 I thought Keith was going to say himself 😂😂 that would of been hilarious
John is by far the funniest part of this video 😂
Id honestly marry Zach
God does not hate lyers
I don't know but i like john.. hes cute :-D like his voice..
John is my favorite person now😂
"God hates liars, and I hate liars" (my face 😳😳😳)
I feel bad they're admitting this on youtube
The Lie Detectors guy FACE THOO
Is it weird that every time I see john I get scared 😳
Honestly zach was so cute in this. But then seeing the sweet side of Eugene was so cute too. And bed and neither too. This was just a really adorable video
John was the real star of the video.
Did anyone else find the lie detector guy super creepy? 😂😂😂
John was so intense, he was easily the funniest person
This is fun but in reality it's total bunk
hello fellow divorce children :,)
Awesome video! There's so many great moments here. I felt bad when they were being asked such personal questions though!
Jon is scaarryyy
John needs to be apart of the Try Guys.
keith thinks about dicks in his mouth? I guess we know who the gay try guy is now
1:10 ZACH'S GIGGLE HEHEHEHEHEHEHE
what's with the straight face dude?
John scared the SNIT OUT OF ME
"I'd kill her."



i died right there
I like John the Poligraph Engineer so much! 😀
I knew Eugene was a top.
This guy is very down to earth 😂
I like the john.
i love this so much
Haha, I am Ned. If I was in this Sanrio I would kill to hahaha
8:20
Zach replace ned for a black guy so zach is european eugen is asian keith is america not racist sorry for the offended ones
I like it how their is a professional examiner even tho a lie detector isn't proven to be effective for it to prove if a person is lying 100% the time. This is my personal opinion on this matter but I feel like we should get rid of lie detector
Everything is a toy if you play with it
                                                              -Zach 2017
I DONT KNOW THOUSE BABIES IM CRYYYYINGGGGG
This was amazing
"I'll kill you right here"
Ned is a terrible liar
John was creepy wtf
i love john lol
Hey why can't they do this in jail or in court so they know who is lying?
God doesn't hate liars he hates sin.
Omg John's face throughout the video 😂😂😂 he's legit soulless lol
"I don't know those babies"😂😂😂
Hey zach remember when you drank Ned's wine when you broke In to his hous pet being santa? I'm sorry I'm typing with one finger
I normally don't watch videos twice. Even less thrice.
God hates liars and I hate liars
John is my favorite
lol😂😂😂 at 6:35 why were they so surprised, it's chicken.
I feel like Eugene would be a good cop he seems good at interrogation and literally everything else
It's angering me how long Keith's tie is
8:20 😂 oh my god he sounded so fed up 😂
Very Personal Questions
"Hey Keith, do you like Ned's dog?"
They should've made them take truth serum, that would've been much better
John is the real  MVP of this video lol
repoio
Awww poor Zach😔😔
No! !!!!!!
is eugene gay or bi??
god bless john
"I'll kill you right here." -John.
Add john to the try guys for an episode
Ned:I feel like you know there's like a lot of shades of grey in the world 
John:I'll kill you right here
🤣😂😂
"It's not a toy" OMFG I CANT BREATHE
Cancer
Divorce does stuff to your brain is true
John is my favorite try guy
Well Keith is ACTUALLY the best try guy
god hates liars... I hate liars
Eugene in the background at 6:18, oh my gosh
the Asian looks autistic
woah John got real serious real fast
Eh, the Give-It-A-Whirl Fuckers do it better
John you're creepy but I like you
I did this with my friends they would be trying to find out if I have a crush and who it is. XD
John is goals 🙌
😂😂😂😭oh my god this is good and funny tho
I don't lie, mainly because I'm too lazy to come up with a good lie
Damn Ned is vicious and Zach is getting that Buzzfeed booty 😂😂😂
I hate Jon
Sooooo Eugene and Zack ??? I think it's sweet.
Don't need a lie detector test to tell when Ned is lying 🤥
Have to say this is one of my favourite videos on YouTube 😂
There seems to be a little tension in the Try Guys.
Zach : "if you give me a direct question, I'll give you a direct Answer"

.... Can't answer any yes or no question directly 😂😂😂
John: i hate liers 
Me: every one lies
Does that means 
You hate every one
"God hates liars, and I hate liars". What is he trying to imply
"i dont know those babies"
The job has destroyed his soul
NOT THE ITALIAN BABIES!😂
I volunteer as Eugene's baby mama.
"Eugene: Do you think you talk to much?"
Me at the bitches at school 😂😂😂😂
Okay but we can all agree that John was the star of this video
I like John. We can relate.
''I don't know those babies'' I died 😭😭
"God hates liars, I hate liars, I am god
"I don't know this babies." LMAOOIIII NOKH
I could go on all day about how polygraph tests are perceived as infallible. Truth is, even the creator of the machine was appalled by how police used the device. That being said, I can't pass up a try guys video. 🙂
Ned was the greatest
the try guys should try playing quidditch.
lol 7:36 Zach's face. just look i promise
I really want to do this with my friends...
that test doesnt work
This is officially my favorite episode in the try guys series. 😂
I'm surprised by Eugene in this the most. he told the truth the most but looked tortured by it.
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." LMFAO
i love john.
Why not the try guys try killing themselves
the guy was so serious :p
Someone give me some wood, nails, and a hammer. I'm gonna start building Zach and Eugene's ship! (͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I like John😂
You guys couldn't have picked a creepier tester😂
I think we need part 2
I don't know those babies.
"I don't know those babies..." hahaha
"I dont know those babies" 😂😂😂😂😂
they should do the girls version I bet there's a lot of lies and secret😂😂😈😈
Keith should have said Keith :')
Kieth is so fugly and unfunny
8:23
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 
So is John God?
who wants a Shane Dawson\ Try Guys collab???
Hey Mr. Lie detector guy lie detectors are seudo-science and have no proof backing them
8:20
lie detector traumatized me bc i had to do it for a job interview 😭😭
Im pretty sure John is a killer He creeps me out
John is so intense omg
Does anybody else want John to have his own Youtube channel? Please, John? What would his username be? PolygraphJohn? GodHatesLiars? illkillyourightthere?
I hate Keith
I'm at a tie for Try Guy crushes now, Zac and Eugene but neither would date me so I can just dream
Maybe Eugene just wants to f himself.... he's a member of the try guys
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"

Well sir, you must be god then.
Polygraphs measure things like blood pressure, perspiration, heart rate and other bodily functions. There has been no direct clinical proof to show that those factors are effected when one is lying. Even if asked your name in a polygraph, if you're extremely nervous the machine will likely see it as a lie. That is why it is an ineffective tool as it can be easily passed if remained calm.
That guy sounds very robotic
john is my spirit animal
Zach is so cute😂
too bad lie detectors dont work.
"If see one of them lying I'll let you know, God hates liars, I hate 😡Liars".
4:53
tf that dude John is creepy af
Keith 'is' the best Try Guy; he just has 'it'. Charisma for days.
hillary clintons one of many hippocracies "lie detectors are not accurate..."i will take a lie detector"
what's with Ned going from 0 to 5000 in 2 seconds. he's got some anger or control issues; vey creepy and unsettling.
Wait, why do the Buzzfeed feminists have their own youtube channel, but not the Try Guys?
I love the Try Guys lmao
why does he sound like that (he's telling the truth)
Zach has made out with three coworkers and there are three other try guys hhhmmm
I just want this to be a series
The rate goes like this
Eugene - Best looking😍
Keith - Most likeable and nicest🤗
Ned - Most in love ❤️💗❤️
Zach - Most into Cuteness💟
everyone likes Keith  and zach was so happy he got chosen by Keith
something about John is so funny
JOHN'S SERIOUSNESS IS KILLING ME LMAO
The past few videos were not as good as I expected but this one is one of the best without a doubt
Everything is a toy if you play with it
WHERE ARE THE CAPTIONS?!
Okay let's be real, who else was like "woah this man is intense" after he said "god hates liars, and I hate liars too" cause I sure as hell did. 😲😲😲😲
I don't know those babies
LOL
"nobody likes nuns Eugene, i grew up catholic" -ned 
hes got a point, hes got a hell of a point
Ned: have you ever pictured anyone in the office naked..?
BRUH, ARE YOU NOT AWARE OF YOUR MULTIPLE VIDEOS OF YOU GUYS GETTING NAKED? THERE'S NO NEED TO PICTURE IT, IT ALREADY EXISTS😂😂
Is John secretly Ron Swanson?
Eugene is super sexy in a tie and rolled up sleeves. Like someone I know cough,cough Kookie cough,cough
the "i don't know those babies" killed me
slow head turn "I'll kill you right here." AAAAHAHAHAHA LMFAO
God hate NO ONE
Awww eugene is so depressed
God hates liars, and I hate liars.
Everything's a toy if you can play with it
i love Keith and Eugene!!!
A good try guys episode at last!! It has been a long time. I love Eugene and Zac !!!
I love Eugene, such a cool guy and I think he's kinda cute too
TELL THE TRUTH!
Even though lie detectors are a shame,
the real reason why there are so many viewers is because you want to learn how to lie in order to pass a lie detector test? You may not be a criminal, but just in case!?!?






me too!
loose lips sink ships, even your own and i am going over board before the Titanic sinks
10/10 have more John. I love him.
the try guys should try a period stimulator!! know the pain a girl goes through every month!
I lowkey think Eugene is emo
Though Eugene has the most secrets, he told the truth more so than any of the other Try Guys. He owned up to all his truths. The cold exterior is a front!
Lol, John was uncomfortablely serious "gods hates liars, and I hate liars" and "This is not a toy" aahahahaha
Just so people know a lie detector isn't always right. There is a scene in the show Lie to Me, where the head of the company explains to some people developing a hand held lie detector. That it's about as effective as holding an egg, if you were lying the egg would break, because you would start to grip it tighter. However, it wasn't very effective because people would get afraid, angry, nervous, and the egg would break despite them telling the truth. So in all, don't trust a lie detector that much, especially in a stressful/nervous/scary/tension filled/ annoyed environment.
9:44 what did Eugene say?
"everything is a toy if you play with it" 😂😂😂😂 only zach
I'll kill you right here.
Okay so, no ones gonna talk about how daddy Eugene looks in this. Like every other video/ ok.
LOL best one I've seen in awhile. They're all great together. Zach is my favourite and would like to marry him pls.
BuzzFeed: ___ is lying.
Holosexuals: THATS NOT WHAT THE FIB FINDER SAYS
God hates liars. John hates liars. JOHN IS GOD.
Literally my favorite Try Guys video
hahahaha i loved John!
Am I the only one really attracted to Zach?
quick, imagine there personalities switch
How I thought 0:29 would go:
"God hate liars and I hate liars.... I AM God."
John is my hero
God hates liars. Whole concept of religion falls apart.
how many times has this video been done?
how does anyone call eugene unattractive???
To be fair all 3 try guys besides Keith said Keith was their favorite so technically, Keith is the best try guy lol
Hahaha I laughed so hard at this xDD I wish I could try !
omg when Keith said he'd give up fried chicken for Becky mY HEART MELTED
3:04 I would have murdered the nuns too because they're going to heaven anyway. I'm not sure about Ariel though 😂
Plus I went to the catholic kindergarten and God knows how much I wanted to burn that place with the nuns locked inside of it
keith is so loved
Nooo! not Bean!!!
Why does John always say "Keith is telling the truth." with Keith but with everyone else it's "He is telling the truth."
God hates liars and I hate liars
you should make the try guys try $1 preginacy test
I laughed so hard in this video😂
Lol Ned thinks he's the best try guy and Eugene was thinking about replacing him.

Think about it. He wouldn't replace Keith cause he's most people's favourite, wouldn't replace himself cause he's Asian and not straight, and wouldn't replace Zach cause he's Jewish.
John is hardcore
still dont understand why keith has so much love, eugene and ned their the best
Zach: Do you think your more handsome than Keith?
Ned: Yes.

*in the background
Keith mouthes: f*ck you. 

IM DYING !! LMAO
OMFG JOHN IS GREAT 
"I'd kill her" 🙏🏻😭
Kill the rest of the world or your wife?



ummmmm..... BOTH
0:30 I think he's telling the truth...
zach looks so hot in this video
okay this is rlly deep towards the end
I love Ned he said would kill a boat of babys for his wife😂😭"I dont know those babys"
WHY DO I SHIP ZACH AND EUGENE?!
Too bad it's been proven that these tests are BS
this is so beautiful
is Keith gay
"God hates liars and I hate liars" -John My new motto 😂😂
Pfff this shit's hilarious! Also lotta love for Keith in this room <3
John is scary
"everything's a toy" 😏😂😂😂
Some of these questions actually caught me off guard. Keith genuinely thinking he's the funniest, Eugene wanting to replace, Ned and his Wife's persona
Team eugene <3
I love John. His straight-faced humor makes it all the more hilarious.

Not even surprised about Eugene and Zach. The UST is palpable and always has been.
At 4:56 I could tell he was lying by that no before the guy even said anything.
Is John okay?
can you please make a video try guys try parkour
Keith was so funny in this video 😂😂😂
I think Eugene is the best
"Nobody likes nuns, eugene" TRUE
Make John the new member of the Try Guys please.
"I don't know those babies"
the lie detector guy is the best part of this video....and the fact that EVERYONE loves keith
Jon was great in this 😂😂
This was one of the best try guy videos ever omg
John is scary af
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"
John is savage.
John is amazing i want him to have a show
🐢😈🐻👼🏼 who is who?
try being gay for a week lol
I don't know those babies 😂😂😂😂😂 And that dramatic music killed me
"I do lie, but only because I don't wanna hurt people's feelings." Awww...
Eugene is both physically and mentally attractive; I would love to have a conversation with him or hear him speak somewhere; so insightful.
This was hilarious
I hate to spoil this but those outfits are seriously "dope" 😉
the guy who is saying who is lying and not said God hates lyers, that's a lie because God loves everyone
Eugene needs to be protected and loved
wow the examiner is super mono tone and not happy to be there. the poor guy he probably been in business for a long time and then he has to do this.
So Keith has had penises on his mouth? my
GET EUGENES MOM TO COME ON
John reminds me of Ron Swanson
John is a fun guy.
Feel bad that ned hasn't had any good experiencences with nuns. They can be some of the kindest women, if it were not for the religious sisters that I know I don't know where I would be today.
I love john
John
Johns my new dad
John hates liers try guys
hey buzzfeed why not the try guys go to Philippines and try Pilipino things like

Games:
patintero
tumbang preso
kadang kadang

Food:
pancit
pinakbet
lechon baboy
adobo 
blood stew

places:
luneta park (rizal park) hundred islands
palawan
boracay
vigan
etc.

pilipino cultures,and etc.
Dog hates liars
"God hates liers, and I hate liers"




He is lying
Eugene says he wants kids. 

Everyone volunteers
do the haka
I love the John guy
7:38 PAUSE! LOOK AT ZACH!! LMFAOOO!!!!
They should try taking an IQ test
Aww, Zach
idk why everyone thought keith was the best try guy, my fav is Eugene. he funny as hell
Does buzzfeed realise that the polygraph test doesn't actually work?
Ned digging his own damn grave at 8:00
Everything is a toy if you play with it...
"I don't know those babies"
I don't get why anyone likes Keith the most
yikes John is creepy
You guys should do a video where you get transformed into rock stars and perform a  Rock concert. Like and comment if you agree!
The try guys go skydiving or bungee jumping
The real question is who the hell hurt John. He talked about killing people a lot.
Eugene must have trained for years
"I don't believe in true love"
"Awwww"
I love u guys
Okay so is it just me or Zach was really touchy with Eugene,i can't
I would vote Eugene as the best <3
so they're just gonna take the lie detector guy from all def digital
I <3 Zach
John was going to strangle Ned
"everythings a toy if you play with it" ahahaha!
7:33 I thought he said "ned stark" 😂😂😂
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SERIES!!!!
Why you gotta bring a god in to it.
lie detectors work on lies 50% of the time...
10:02 we know what youre really saying ;)
HAAAA KEITH IS GAY!!!!! But seriously most people would get that told as a lie because although they know in their mind their not but their body reaction,people etc. would make them nervously
All of you girls offering to give Eugene children: Do you have any clue how INCREDIBLY freaking creepy that is?
Lying makes you go to hell (where's the crafties at?)
Ned sometimes reminds me of Ned Schneebly (honestly who knows how to spell that)
I don't like John
"I'll kill u right here"

OK.......
"god hates liars, and i hate liars"
OMFG SO DAMN FUNNY HAHAHA 😂😂😂
What if Eugene wanted to screw himself and not necessarily Zach, loll.
hasn't it been proved that these tests are very inconclusive.
OKAY BUT WHO DID ZACH MAKE OUT WITH
John is now my favorite person!
Best Try Guy's video yet! 😂👏
I feel like I just have to voice how much I love Eugene. He is probably as close to perfect as humanly possible.
"You psycho, don't applaud him" I
...can't... breath...😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
guess you could call them the LIE GUYS
Damn who hurt John? 😂
I feel like the lie detector guy needs a hug
john is terrifying
7:21-7:31 My heart feels the honesty. From Eugene and Keith's response.
John is scary af
I would run if I saw him in real life
Please have the try guys pick out tattoos for each other please please please!!!!!!!!!!!!
...I like nuns
i love john from All Def Digital's videos lolol
John is my inner self
8:19 that moment when he turned around
John effing made this video from good to legendary!!!
that guy operating the lie detector machine looks like he wants to smuggle himself in his own truck, then afterwards start lying to himself while drowning himself in a tub of lies that he poured from his mouth
I would have been the most evil one and would have asked Eugene if hes ever kissed Quinta....(Oh im sure i spelled her name wrong)
I love Zach's laugh at the Keith's big mouth question.
"I dont know those babies" im dying
John sounds so depressed
Lol polygraphs don't work but this is hilarious anyway
EUGENE WANTS KIDS??????? MY BODY IS READY.
I got so scared when John said "I'll kill you right here" I thought he would've done it...
it is the guy who was eating the sucker thing
still don't know his name
that is actually for one of them
I don't know his name 
but he has glasses and darkish hair
for some of them I knew they were lying cause their faces would look weird and sometimes squashed
This is hilarious!
Do it with the girls now!
NEXT, THE TRY GUYS GET READ BY THE PSYCHIC TWINS!? pls
i dont know those babies. 
jokes
Zack and Eugene should hook up.
John made my day.
"It's not a toy."
It's like, the more videos I see them in the more obvious it is that Eugene and Zack have the lowest self esteem, Ned has the highest, and Keith is the most well rounded and likeable one.
You could tell they reeaally pissed John off. He never smiled or stuttered. He especially hates Ned because of the marriage question and in the beginning John said got hates liars, and Ned said he'd kill a boat of nuns and no one likes nuns
the try guys sort of reminds me of impractical jokers...
Let us hope that John's wife doesn't ever watch this episode
Why are all the lie detector people so moody
Zachs laugh ❤️
FUCKIN JOHN WHAT A LEGEND
Why do they all look like they are about to cry when they are caught lying?
Ned: do you believe in true love?
Eugene: no...
John: he's telling the truth.
BABY WHO HURT YOU, I WILL BE YOURS
THIS GUY IS THE BEST
"I'll kill you right here"
"I'd kill her"
"God hates liars and I hate liars"

WHO HURT THIS MAN
JOHN WHO HURT YOU
He's got sooooooo nefvous
more like "The Lie Guys"  BADUM PSHHH
😂😂😂😂😂😂
CONSPIRACY THEORY: JOHN IS A DOG
This video just made me want to hug Eugene! Always saw him as cocky and into himself because he is hot but this video changed my mind. He really needs more than people just lusting after him all the time.
Eugene is correct. Being a divorce child does do things to brains. I know because I am one.
This was one of the best videos.
John is the best 😂
The polygraph does not work. Watch the Adam ruins everything.
But like god doesn't hate anyone so technically that dude is lying does that mean he hates himself lets all give him a big hug
hahaha John is the best part! 😂
Eugene wants kids.
I've never wanted kids before this moment.
The lie detector guy represents me when I'm at school
Eugene start your own Youtube channel!!! (insert heart eyes emojis)
I'm a simple girl, I see Eugene I click.
Can Eugene just have his own Buzzfeed, like Buzzfeed E or something.
I love how the lie detector guy is always smiling
Am i the only one who doesn't really like Keith??
Can we talk about how Eugene not Keith should be known as the best Try-Guy.
Eugene: "I love being hooked up to machines"
well ok then there's a few more questions to ask with John here
I love john just how calm he his over the craziness behind him
They do need a black guy , but I think 5 ppl may be too much?
Lie detectors have proven to be in accurate, still a good video
This is the best video I have ever watched.
"I'll kill you right here".  XD
1:04 YaoiLoverOfAllKinds
lie detector tests are fake..they know that right?
I've seen this john guy like five times
I really laughed so hard😂 I can watch this for a thousand times and still laugh😂
I wouldn't mind getting interrogated by Eugene. Just saying 😘
I just want to give Eugene a big hug
John is hella scary lmao
Eugene just doesnt fit w the try guys
I'm kinda crying about Eugene a little bit... crying a little more about how much of myself I just saw in him.
"It's not a toy."
John is the type of person to get happiness out of telling a child that Santa is fake.
omg at 2:54 eugene was dying
I mean, I could've told you Eugene believes in ghosts. Jeez.
notice he always says keith always when he talks to keith but not the others
keith: is any of it just for show? 
ned: yeah, sure. 
he looked so sad OMG
this polygraph examiner is scary af
7:15 forever alone 😂
Subscribe to my channel
Do the try guys try to make cartoon sound effects... And make a short film with it
John: God hates lyers

Me: WELP IM GOING TO HELL
"It's not a toy" "anything's a toy if you play with it" XD
Just when the guy turned around and looked Zach(?) in the face when he was talking about older marriage
This was just amazing
That guy is scary..
its interesting how people think the lie test is in fact fake
that was fun! :)
"Who's your favorite Try Guy?"

Eugene: Keith
Zach: Keith
Ned: Keith
Keith: ....Keith
"I hate liars" says the person who is lying. Lie detectors don't work
Hopefully you guys know that lie detectors don't really work right?
Okay but no ones talking about the fact Zachary has made out with 3 coworkers... interesting?
"I'll kill you right here" made my day, actually my week
"I dont know those babies." 😂😂😂😂
That creepy dude has no humor
Jon is actually a cold hearted savage
"Well everything's a toy if you play with it.." IM DYING 😂 ԻՊ
2:52 the way Zach asked the question
"God hates liars and I hate liars" THIS GUY OMG
I don't think he hates people that lie
When Eugene said he believes in ghosts, I was surprised. He doesn't seem like the type. But tbh, it made him even cooler in my eyes, cuz he was so unapologetic about it. I also believe in ghosts so kinship.
I DO NOT want to meet the guy who lied to john...
He does not like liars😂😂
Asking Ned about his SO: "1000 BABIES OR YOUR WIFE?!" 
Asking Keith about his SO: "would you, like... not eat fried chicken for her?"
I had a dream last night that Ned and Ariel got divorced and I was so sad when I woke up 😭 Ned cheated on Ariel 😩
I NEED TO KNOW WHO ZACH MADE OUT WITH!!!
IM AM ABSOULOUTELY DISSAPOINTED IN EUGINE AND NED HOW DARE THEY COMPARE A BOAT OF NEW BORN ITALIAN BABIES TO A WOMAN. DISGUSTING
BEST VIDEO OF THE TRY GUYS!Who agrees?
This was just too awesome 😂😂😂 I seriously died laughing!!
Keith IS the best try guy, why does zack even bother askin?
NEVER TRUST LIE DETECTORS ITS ONLY TEC IT CAN BE LIEING TO YOU
After the personal questions Eugene looked so sad and insecure and I felt so bad
everything's a toy if you play with it.
Eugene is soooo cutw
Ok then mister JOHN
It would be really cool to see you guys try extreme sport! Maybe skydiving, snowboarding, bullriding, sumo wrestling, maybe fashion show(runway walk), bee keeping?, fly fishing, fishing for crocodiles, noodling/ catching catfish using your hands, or making wine( use feet to step on grapes to make wine), professional food eating conest, or even try guest starring/preforming circus (could dress like clowns idk), theres a million things you guys could do its crazy. I love watching these shows its awesome!!
well, now we know John is christian.... moving on...
How did he keep a straight face the whole time 😂😂
"God hates liars, I hate liars." JOHN WHO HURT YOU ??
you know polygraph tests don't actually work? right? like as long as you stay confident and you keep your heart rate down you can easily lie. hell you could even tell the truth and if you're nervous then it'll say you're lying.
"i don't know those babies." OMG Ned x)
7:32 ...  its sounds like "do you like Ned Stark " ...
1:22 in and ive learned so much about Keith
Keith IS the best Try Guy!
Eugene is so hot man
I genuinely expected keith , when asked which try guy was his favorite to say " keith "
These four have the ultimate kpop boy group dynamic
eugene looks like the 13 reasons why zack
Why is John Ron Swanson??
God hates liars and I hate liars because I am God.
This is one of my favorite videos 😂😂
I'm a child of divorce too Eugene 🤘🏽
Eugine is so ❤, but he looks broken. I just want to hug him!!!
Ned: Do you think I talk about my wife too much?
Keith: Well yea... 
Zach: Any of us could've told you that 
😂😂
i think in order of the the best try guys is Keith , Eugene & zach are equal then ned😂
Eugene is so cool
Does John laugh ????? Like he stares at the screen and says. The truth he's lying
no, it's a three 😂😂😂
Bourbon in them cups.
"God hates liars and so do I" 😂😂😂
After this the Try Guys were no longer friends.
This was super fun.
Who else thinks that they should go on a rollercoaster?!
John is my spirit animal
All Def Digital
John reminded me of Ron Swanson...
The Try Guys read Try Guy fanfiction lol
JOHN WAS ON RUPAUL'S DRAG RACE AS A LIE DETECTOR!
Try guys try to be mermaids for a day
Zach:Do you think I'm ever going to fimd true love 
Keith:Yes 
John:HES lieing
"Are you calling me a liar?"
"Well I aint calling you a truther!"

My Childhood😢😂😂😂

Nice Video by the way😂
John was so intense. Omfg.
Ned just loves his wife
Me scared of john
fun fact: lie detectors were invented by the creator of wonderwoman, who was also in a polyamorous relationship for decades. In the 50s.
keiths mouth is too big its so annoying every time i see it 😂
My job in the military required me to take a lie detector test because I had top secret clearance.
Zach was so cute in this video. His laughter was so infectious!
10:17 zach :"well every thing is a toy if u play with it "     WELL THATS WHAT SHE SAID
I got my molar removed yesterday, it's extremely painful to laugh/smile, I am in so much pain after watching this
"Do you think I would be a good husband?" Eugene's dying of laughter in the background
The lie detector guy is killing me
Keith: Have you ever wanted to f*ck one of us?Eugene: NoJohn:He's lying Eugene's thought(I would f*ck all of you)
This whole thing was so uncomfortable
I have to say Keith is my favourite 😂😂😂
GOD HATES LIERS, and i HaTE liers!!!!!! JoHn RaGEs QuiEtLY
Ned you're the worst at lying, I didn't even need to hear John's response to know you were lying haha
JOHN, MY MAN
This was hilarious! and informative... and a bit sad when Eugene said he didn't know how much the others care for him.
I don't know those babies
"Eugene do you think that's weird?" "No." "Well it is." 😂😂
Eugene would make really cute babies
I think it's so funny when John says:"He's telling the truth or he's lying."😂😂
dammit john
Eugene is so hot
(When Eugene told the truth about not believing in true love)

Zach: Awww!
John was amazing.
Hes telling the truth hahahaahaha
only reason ned wouldnt kill her yet is because he hasnt been married as long as john has. lol
"Well that was great, I like being hooked up to machines"
"I don't know those babies" BYE
"everything's a toy if you play with it." lol zach
god hates liars, and i hate liars LMAO
Fun fact: Psychology tells us that polygraphs do not work because of the the subject can manipulate the experiment (knowingly or unknowingly) because they are aware of the purpose of the polygraph. This is called subject bias!
Polygraphs dont even work
He is telling the truth
This is what I imagine a girls slumber party true or false conversation to be like
Lie detectors are not reliable.
I'm a simple girl. I see Eugene in the thumbnail, I click.
This is so funny
The Try guys go to a haunted house, please make it happen !!
I want to give Eugene a hug in all the Try Guys' videos (it's kind of a given). But I especially want to give him a hug in this one. I completely relate to that dude.
John is terrifying
This video is #44 on trending!!!!
Zach's laugh though 😍
Keith saying "we gotta be better about that" is why he's the favorite try guy ❤️
I am laughing so hard
John from Nathan for you
I don't know those babies
Buzz Feed full of Betas ...
John kinda scares me tbh
This was one of my favorites of the try guys!
lmfao!
"I'll kill you right here" john 2017 😂😂
omg i love john
I don't know what I love more, that Keith is the most honest of the bunch or that Zach has been outed for hooking up with so many coworkers
John is just so chill
The   Drfougtogbuugb
Would have been a great opportunity for Kieth to come out of the closet
Eugene and Zack is my new fav ship.
Polygraphs are nonsense, though
lol polygraphs only work 50 percent of the time
"I don't know these babies." IM INT EA RS
"i don't know those babies" lmfaoooooo
No offense but lie detectors are so outdated like people can easily bypass them by using drugs to calm their heart etc and they are easy to fail if you're just generally stressed out about everything and anxious even if you're telling the truth
Zach would make a great politician
"I'll kill you right here" -jhon
It's literally so scary that you see the parallels (?) as when they made a video about like the alpha man and a dominant one.. wow
find a guy who would sacrifice a bus full of nuns and a boat full of Italian babies just to save you. #relationshipgoals
Eugene has me shook on his hair
0:31 Shut up dude, you lied to your wife just the other day.
we need more of john!!!!
I'd honestly love to see The Try Guys try Parkour and/or Free Running!!
Eugene and Keith need to make a gay porn with Zack, and Ned can watch.
While everyone is talking abt Eugene's or Keith's answer or even John's I'll kill you right here statement, I'm just here literally freaking out abt how Ned said tht some of his cute moments with Ariel were just for the show... 😭
the guy is really serious
Damn, it's like... Eugene would treat me so wrong, but oh so right
if I was asked if I would give up roasted chicken for the rest of my life or not marrying my fiance, i would still be engaged for the REST of my life. my English is awful. adobo
Lie detector its not working...its just a placebo effect
Eugene looks like the Korean version of my native boyfriend wtf 😂😂
Lie detectors are unreliable because it detects sweat and how nervous u r but people could be telling the truth but are nervous the are shown as lies
When Ned pauses for long you know he is lying
Zach:Keith do you think ill ever find love
Keith:Yah!
John:Hes lying 
Zach: Dammit Keith 
Me*:LAUGHING THEN THROWS PHONE ON FLOOR BY ACCIDENT* 
LOL
uuuuuuuuhm they could've asked better Qs! like has Eugene ever fucked Kelsey! or if he's really gay!
Can I please get one like?My birthday is tommorow:-)
Awww their friendship is the sweetest
I started watching the try guys cause of Eugene, I think I like him even more now ♡♡♡
god hates liars and I hate liars
I dont know those babies
literally all i care about in this life is eugene <3 <3 like, i relate so hard to so much about him. the honesty in these moments, the painful truths, the pretty wide breadth of self awareness, and of the fear of introspection while simultaneously knowing it exists and has to be done for things to get better. eugene, if you ever read this, know that i see you in so many of these vids being honest about discomfort and fear, and being vulnerable and i think that is fucking amazing. for me, one of the most rewarding things about watching try guy videos. so so SO much love for you, eugene. <3
Does anyone get the ad bout that ostrich...
"God hates liars and I hate liars"
HOW CAN YOU NOT LOVE THIS CUTE BEANIE
Neds hair is looking gooood!
They should do this more
Bonus Question : Eugene are you gay????? ...
God didn't like liers he forgives
John is my Suger daddy
Why don't they use these in court? ( i know i can google it but I prefer the YouTube community response)
JOHN IS BEST TRY GUY
Damn, that guy John is pretty fuckin intense!
I had a dream about Eugene, he was walking around in public naked with these other people...
again p l s
"Everything's a toy if you play with it"
Jon is not having it
"Do you kill the Italian baby boat, Ned?"
Oh Ned's Catholic. Good to know.
"I don't know those babies" XD
My name is Jafar
I come from afar
There is a bomb in my car
Allahu akbar
This was damn interesting... need to do with my whole co-worker to tell them indirectly how much I hate them..
Who hurt john??? My gods 😂
I'd marry Zach 😂
John on ADD too
I need a polygraph test just to know how far in denial I am
So if you have anxiety disorder, most of the things you say would be read as lies?
"God hates liars, And I hate liars." God damn bro.
That man who's testing them means business
did anyone else think keith was gonna answer "keith" when he was asked who his favorite try guy was?? 😂😂😂
"I don't know those babies"  I am deceased 😂
THIS IS MY FAVORITE TRY GUY VIDEO
"Eugene, do you know how much the rest of us care about you?"
"No"
"We've gotta be better about that"
Okay but this is so cute??
kieth is troutty mouth. like if you get the refrence
*ZACH asks Ned*: DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE A BETTER MARRIAGE THAN JOHN?!
Ned: Well, I don't know... I guess...*starts rambling because he's nervous* well, he's older and marriages get worse...
JOHN: I'LL KILL YOU RIGHT NOW!!!!
"My mother was weaned on the teat of the town psychic" WHY HAS NO ONE ELSE MENTIONED THIS WHAT THE HECK EUGENE
ZACH to Keith: Do you think I'll ever find love? OwO
KEITH: thinks about answer ...yeah!
JOHN: HE LIEING 
Zach walks away in disappointment
Keith acts surprised 😳
😂 😂 😂 😂
I can't tell if John was being sarcastic or if he's just no fun
Wow just wow this was hilarious
Ned is my favorite try guy
4:30
4:57
5:27
I want to know😑😂.
I LOST IT when he said "God hates liars, and I hate liars" LMFAO hilarious. P.S. Zach, I will marry you.
Too bad polygraphs are fake. They detect heart rate, sweat, nervousness, etc. so if your just nervous it will detect that your "lying" even if your not. They were only made to scare criminals. Back in the 1700's/1800s they used to make "criminals" hold hot iron rods and if they "lied" it would burn them. Many criminals have actually managed to "pass" the lie detector test by remaining calm. They actually have college classes that teach you how to beat a polygraph test.
Just you you all know, polygraph tests an be very inaccurate, for example, a man once did a polygraph test on a plant and concluded that plants could feel emotions. Also, a few criminals have passed the polygraph test because they weren't nervous about answering, they were just laid back.
LOVED IT!!!!!!!!
I have built a ship 
Zugene 
Zach 
&
Eugene
lol
if you like this comment I will subscribe to your youtube channel
Ned is the best Try Guy
Everything's a toy if you play with it
hey Johns from All Def Digital
imagine being those coworkers zach's kissed 😂😂
I love when they all giggle in the background
Eugene is a child of divorce,  doesn't believe in love, and doesn't know how much they care about him. Breaks my heart!
John: I will kill you right here.
@ 4:19 when the guy tells them Eugene is telling the truth 😂💀 he's like seriously?
You guys should attempt to try to play instruments I believe it will be fun
well john is friendly :)
John is Savage
The try guys should have their own channel
They stole John from ADD!!! 😂
Lie detectors don't actually work they only say if you are telling a lie or not by your heart rate
There goes Eugene again talking about not being attractive.....

but he issssssss
this was funny.
Ned has become so scary now. Like he would literally start a zombie apocalypse if that means saving his wife 😂
"God hates liars" did anyone else go 'well he fu*king hates me 😂😂
'John would you save the orphans or save your wife?"

"kill my wife"
Dear The Try Guys, will you guys try to prom with me?
John can't be for real, that has to be a character
right?
fyi, lie detectors don't work. #1 people that go to jail sometimes, didn't do anything. #2 lie detectors are basically seeing if your lying by reading your nerves, so like if you get nervous it would be shown as a lie. #3 75% of the time the lie detector is wrong..
About the beginning - God doesn't hate liars; he loves everyone because he created everyone.
i'm very concerned about John
Zach Do you like Ned's dog? 
Ned WHAT? 
Keith No, I just don't like dog 
John He's telling the truth 
Ned Do you like Eugene's dog 
Keith Actually I do XD 
John He's telling the truth 
😂😂😂😂
The guy is so intense.
John is great 👍
The Try Guys should try doing silk!
do the try guys try bleach
Eugene I think he is gay sometimes I mean I don't have a problem with it but he just kind of goes off that vibe
I really see Eugene as Sirius, especially when he said he didn't know how much they cared about him
I'm a devorse baby Eugene,ur not alone
thats the dude from add
These types of test don't work. If they get nervous or sexually aroused, it changes the answers. Get a person that professionally detects lies.
Did Eugene lie even once?? I don't think he did. Or maybe he's good at staying calm while lying......
"I'll kill you right here" 😂 8:19
John is also part of the kkk hahahha
lol I thought he said dogs hate liars, I hate liars I was like wow. That's so sweet.
more like the LIE GUYS!! Eh eh? 








Ok I'll leave now...
"It's not a toy" hahaha Wow buzzfeed actually made an entertaining video lol.
"Everything's a toy if you play with it"
I love how John has no facial expression through the whole thing
When John is actually the best thing about a Try Guys video
"I'll kill you right now"
"I'd kill her"
Needs to hire John for my birthday!
You can tell by the body language whether they're lying or telling the truth. :)
polygraphs can be fooled
When he said "I'll kill you right here" I died 😂
omg Keith would give up fried chicken.
john looks a bit scary
I keep assuming Zach is gay even though I know he isn't. I've read way too many malec fanfics.
John was scary
Can I hug Eugene pls
Let the girls take the test!
Jesus loves everyone
i honestly don't know how anyone could, not believe in true love. i just don't understand.




could someone explain?
i am eugene, eugene is me
eugenes "and thats super gross" sounds fake as hell
John is god basically because he said God hates liers and he hates liers SO godseption
If Keith would give up fried chicken, he's gonna marry Becky
I'm t
alian
I thought Keith was going to say Keith as his favorite of the try guys 😁
"We don't need to hear your explanation"
Why does eugene look extra Chinese in this video😂😂😂
So... is John God?
why is john so depressed
Anyone: Do you think you'll be alone forever?

Me: Yes. No doubt. 


John: He's telling the truth.
John is seriously creepy with the music and the zoom in.
"I don't know those babies" 😭😭😂
Man do I identify with Eugene's answers omg.
John seriously needs to watch something funny.
Eugene... you hair is beautiful but nothing beats you eyes and smile! ;)
Love you guys!!! <3
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 
Me: is that a lie?
Zach I totally agree about question complexity. Most answers are more than yes or no! There's always more to say.
can i rent john?
I just came here to say that Eugene is so sexy/gorgeous
why Eugene always in the back just shady af??
John needs a hug lol.
John looks like he hates his life..
Eugene: So that was fun...I like been hooked up to machines 

😂😂
"I don't know those babies." I DIED!
HAHAHA
ANY TIME
The Lie Guys
"I don't know those babies" 😂😂I died when he said that lmao
3:55 dang it
I like Eugene the best
I SAW EUGENE AT COACHELLA
"I don't know those babies."
Please, I need a Part 2 of this. At least.
I love Eugene
Everyone in the comments: 'Oh man, it's gonna be so clever when I quote the video 😂😂'
Zach looks sexy in the white shirt, the tie, the lollipop is a nice touch
Buzz fraud #trumplicans
JOHN HAS NO CHILL
to be honest john is kinda creepy
Lie detectors don't work
CAN WE DO THIS ON WORTH•IT? I wanna know if the food is as good as they say it is
Keith is so funny when he is asking the others questions
The lie detector test is a lie in itself. It doesn't even work...
And now, guess who ships Zach and Eugene? 😂😂😂
" God hates liars and I hate liars " he is so scary 😂😂
buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzfeed seems popular. sorry, i like typing the word buzz, lol.
I almost stopped watching when the guy said "God hates liars" lmao
They should try the ouijia (how ever you spell it) board
You could have asked me these questions about them and I could have told you the same answers 😂
I missed them so much omg buzzfeed isn't the same without them and john is my spirit animal.
How does Eugene get his hair like that??
I love how one of the guys Said he Would rather kill a boat full of babies than his wife and the other guys just said ok but when another guy said that he would rather give up fried chicken to Mary his up coming wife they said WAUW!!!!
lie detector tests dont work. so...
...But lie detector tests are fake and don't work?
IS NO ONE GOING TO MENTION NED AND ARIEL'S JUST FOR SHOW PART?
Omg when Ned said the thing about jhon I was freaking cracking up then he said he would kill his ehife
Eugene's answers make me very, very worried for him...
"God hates liars and I hate liars... therefore I am god"
Eugene's answers are seriously concerning...
Should be called an Anxiety Test.
this is the only buzz cancer video I like
lie detector tests like this are BS because it goes by pulse, and blood pressure. any kind of stress can mess it up. period
when you recognize John the polygraph examiner from All Def Digital 😂💀
This was as bad video to watch while doing eyeliner
Self confidence is great, but Keith definitely is extremely arrogant.
The polygraph is highly inaccurate.
I don't think anyone from the UK realised that the Alton towers THEM tune started play half way through it😂
A polygraph is not a lie detector test it just takes you pulse and other body functions. You can tell if the person is nervous by their pulse but it's not 100% accurate. It's also ironic how the guy says he hates liars but yeah he's lying that a polygraph is a lie detector test. Glad you guys had fun with it! Not Trying to be a hater!
When they were like would you replace any of the try guys, and he said yes. And was like "We should have a black guy." I was dying laughing. I think then it would just look like Male Bratz IRL lol
zach is nygma from gothem
Damn, I have so many questions. We need to get Eugene's backstory!
He only says Keith's name! "Keith is telling the truth"
I only like Kieth and Ned
John is my spirit animal :D
I just came here to dislike because buzzfeed.
7:18 best moment HAHAHA
John scares me
Need and Eugene are the most stylish
Somehow need still managed to fit his wife in
Poor Eugene💙💙
Lie detector tests are complete BS. Good for a laugh and that's it :-) So many other factors can be taken into account for. Health conditions and stress. An honest person may be nervous when answering truthfully and a dishonest person may be non-anxious.Serial killers have beaten these things easily.
Keith at 8:14
"I like being hooked up to machine's" - Eugene 

I'm dying 😅😂
John from ADD
WAS THIS DUDE IN SEASON 4 OF DRAG RACE
These guys seem gay.
Lie detectors don't work, it's been proven multiple times.
Who is Eugene dating?
You guys are all the best!
"Do Lie Detectors Work? Calling it a “lie-detector” suggests that a polygraph machine can detect lies. Commonly used in criminal investigations, this device actually measures nervous excitement. It operates on the premise that if a person is telling the truth they will remain calm."... just saying
"I don't know those babies"
I don't trust lie detectors, but this was fun to watch
When does Ned ask Zach if he ever pictured anybody naked?
you don't need a lie detector machine if you have a bracelet from your missing mom... :)
Wait, wasn't the polygraph debunked by the inventor of the polygraph?
That guy in the corner just saying hes lying hes telling the truth am i the only one who finds it funny
"Nobody likes nuns, I grew up Catholic"😂😂😂😂
I don't know those babies!
"I'll kill you right now."








Me: Square up
9:20 "He's telling the truth" when he saying that it sounds like he's surprised! Ha ha ha
GOD HATES LIARS AND I HATE LIARS
when john said "I'll kill her" about his wife and the kids it got me weak
The lie detector guy was so creepy
I was losing interest in these guys with some of their recent moves on the internet, but this vid brought me back.
Can we have that older gentleman be the next addition to the try guys I like his dark sense of humor
What is the point of lying while durng a lie detector test???
Polygraph test is just a scam even the inventor of the polygraph test don't believe it works.
Zach is so cute omg
You guys know lie detectors don't actually work right?
lie detectors are pretty much inaccurate and have been disproven
"I don't know those babies."
Fuckin John passes the edgy test XD
"everything is a toy when u play with it " XD
:)
Damn Adam Conover would be disappointed
Lie detectors don't work xD
the try guys drop acid
"God hates liars"

"I hate liars"



DIES
This is funnier because of Zach eating a sucker.
Can you get John to be a Try Guy? I feel like he's the kind of diversity you need at Buzzfeed.
PLLLEEEAAASSSSEE DO HORSE RIDING!!!
John the lie detector guy is amazing. He's either really good at not breaking character, or really is a psychopath. Either way, made a great vid! lol
Johns got a thing for killing
that was really funny
Eugene actually kinda look like Jay Chou or Vanes Wu
Make it a series! Best video I saw today and I watch like way too many.
"He's Telling The Truth".....
I think I laughed more on this one than any other of their videos.
Ned looks so scary sometimes...
Wtf that robot saying "he's lying" or "he's telling the truth"
John reminds me of Ron Swanson.
John Swanson
Eugene is smokin hot #asalways
Really wanting the try guys to come to vidcon Australia!
My fave try guys: keith and eugene. Very genuine! Love love love!!!
Adam has already ruined this :P
John is some savage huh?
i'm special
Lying makes you go to hell...
xDDDD
"I like being hooked up to a machine" (Eugene)
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" (Zac)
I love nuns
Eugene wants children..? IM HERE HELLO
Eugene is beautiful
I am Ned
Too bad they dont work
"do you think im ever gonna find love?"
"yea"
"keith is lying"
"Do you like working for BuzzFeed?"

Everyone: Yes

machine explodes
We need more try guys
Hello to the people who read this!....Have a great day!
Also, wanna hear a story?...I found this on reddit :D...

                                                  The Story Of The Caller
DISCLAIMER-THIS IS SORTA SCARY (FOR ME) SO PLZ DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANNA BE CREEPED)

My mum was sat down, On her phone in the living room. The telephone rang so i ran and picked up as my mum was sat down enjoying her programmes. I heard a voice saying 'Heh-lohhh..'   The voice was deep...Like the horror films. 
I replied 'Hello?'
'Can I speak to Mrs_______(mums name)' he said and the he let out a creepy laugh... I looked at my mum and she straight away knew that the phone was for her. She started gesturing to me to say to the person she is not home as there is always usually some annoying seller.
'Uh, she is not at home...Could i please hang up?'

He groaned 0-0 and said 'Awh, u little rat!'
I said 'Me?.....'
'JUST SHUT UP OR IM GOING TO COME AND KNOCK ON UR DOOR! I KNOW WHERE U LIVE!' he shouted
I said 'Where?!'
He just hung up....I couldnt go to sleep but my mum said its probz a prank call.

TY FOR READING AND PLZ CHECK MY CHANNEL OUT ;D    Bye!!!!
Petition to have John become a permanent Try Guy??
John is intense lol
Lies are the glue that holds society together
Polygraphs are actually super bad at detecting lies but it's a fun video! We just shouldn't put all our faith in this kind of machine.
Does Zach and Eugene are gay??
But god isn't or never was real?
As cute and funny as this is, research has shown polygraphs aren't actually that reliable as a method of lie detection
"God hates liars and I hate liars." 😂
I love John XD
I love Ned😂
Lie detectors are outdated everyone knows they don't work 100%
that guy was up for no banter it was really awkward 😂
who hurt john
that john guy seems kinda scary lol
John is... very intimidating
I like John a lot tbh
Almost all Asians parents are divorce. Including me..
Hey! Can anyone give French or English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing, PLEASE?
i'm john
So is Keith gay?
John seems hard af haha God doesn't hate liars, he hates lies. love the sinner hate the sin
I feel like Eugene needs a hug when he said he said no to knowing the try guys cares about him 😭😭 ILL SHOWER U WITH LOVE IF I HAVE TO EUGENE
If you're catholic, Ned why would you hate nuns?
The polygraph is an out dated method of interigation that can be easily tricked
Everyone looks so handsome in their white button-ups and ties! @ A @
It has been proven by many credible sources and PhD's that a polygraph is only 10% - 20% (TRULY) accurate! Look it up. Do the research. This information is ( shocking, scary, and very true) correct!!!
Eugene made me cry so much 😭
this is all the guy says he telling the truth hes liaring
John reminds me a bit of Ron from Parks and Rec
hes telling the truth
god hates liars, john hates liars. therefore, john is god
Every video I watch that causes them to open up more, I get more determined to marry Eugene.
No offence to John, but if a man who looks that tough said he'd kill me right now, I would be terrified. XD Hahaha.
This was interesting!
Try Guys try to DIY dare!!
BLACK MEMBER!
Polygraph doesn't even work FUCKTARDS
this is one of the best videos buzzfeed has uploaded in a while
Give John a Snickers goddamn 😂
eugene - THATS WHY HIS HAIRS SO BIG. it's full of secrets
I don't believe the lie detector don't lie, he do lies, he just lied to us all
Aren't lie detectors pseudoscience and not accurate at all?
God doesn't hate liars. He hates lies. Hate the action, not the person.. if God hated liars and other sinners, then don't you think Jesus would never hang out with tax collectors and prostitutes?
ned is the best😂😂
7:31 DO YOU LIKE NED STARK
New favorite buzzfeed video 😂 I laughed so hard at some of these questions
Is it just me who thinks they all look like jack from fight club when they are warning black ties and holding coffee! 😂
Eugene totally ripped my heart out of my chest. It's not just the fact he doesn't believe in true love... I do not either. But just in the "couple-way". What about family and friends? There is the place where you can find true love. Hold it and believe it. The erected wall maybe protects people from their insecurities but also from the love itself. And that's a shame...
When John said he'd kill his wife I died 😂😂😂😂
eugene should do a hair tutorial
the john guy was scary af he was like ''god hates liars i hate liars''
I thought these were bullcheese.
hey it's Eugene from the try guys, Welcome to your tape
JOHN IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL
"god hates liars, and I hate liars"
This is actually really sad.
I think I fell in love with John:D
Omf John, I can't tell if he joked once in this video but this man can keep a straight face
man this is brutal lol
I love Eugene!!!!!!!!!!! seriously!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."
- Serious face -
Me: - shrinks away -  "Damn."
lets get this straight, the examiner is terrifying
This is my favorite
Omg me and eugine are the same 
1. divosred parents 
2. Korean-Americain
"I'd kill her." -John, with a straight face, talking about his wife
Lie detectors do not work PEROID
The best part about the whole video is that I don't know if John is being serious or if it's just an act
Three discriptions about John:

1. He doesn't display any emotion
2. He always sounds like he's chewing something while talking
3. He sounds like a robot, saying things in the exact same tone every time he talks

EDIT: WHAT THIS COMMENT HAS 830 LIKES??
wow how did they get Ron Swanson to conduct this test
Why are they promoting archaic and repeatedly debunked trash as though it were even relatively accurate? All that matters is how you physically react, if you get excited or stay calm, not what you're actually thinking about.
"I don't know those babies"
Obligatory polygraph tests are inaccurate comment... http://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph.aspx 
(American Psychological Association)
That awkward silence where he said his marriage was better then Johns 😂
Then johns reply to the orphans or your wife. I'm done 😂
I died when john turned his head
keith really loves becky his fiancee😍
John is the best dude ever
"god hates liars, and i hate liars." god dammit it sounds like my mom
god hates lier and I hate lier . wow 🔥
This is the most toned-down I've ever seen Keith and Ned.
This is it. I've come to a conclusion. I'm in love with Eugene
I believe the Friendship DNA test revealed that Zach and Eugene would be the most compatible for hot sex, was it? So it's true eh Eugene? ;)
that thing doesn't even work 😂
John is wild
Does anyone else feel like there's gonna be a bunch of uncomfortable Eugene and zach fan art now?
"do you think i'd make a good husband?" maKES ME SO SOFt #ProtectZach2k17
1. John is apparently the only polygraph tester in all of television land
2. I question the validity of this test, because with all dat Azz who wouldn't want to fck Ned?
I don't know those babies
4:20 way to dogg on his family culture
All of them looked so neat in this video. New hair cuts. Ties. Really nice.
so fake
When the asked which Try Guy Keith liked the most I really wanted him to say "Keith".
God hates lies and god hates me
This was a really fun episode :)
I loved this please make more
John is my spirit animal
"idk those babies"
They should use a lie detector in trials
love you I keith
John "I will kill you right here"
JOHN IS SO CREEPY BUT SOOOO RELATABLE
Lie detectors are not accurate.
I want John to be my uncle I get left alone with in the living room while dinner is getting prepared.
The dude that runs the machine is intense
Keith
Anyone else get weirded out when the poly guy said his intro 😶🤔
Keith is the best
EUGENE WITH HIS SLEEVES ROLLED THO
"God doesn't like liars and i don't like liars"
where can we go to do this? how much is it ? anyone know?
i don't know those babies
by far my favorite try guys video ever
John = God
Why is the guy always like"Keith is telling the truth" and for the rest of them he says "He's telling the truth"
zach: do u ever want children
eugene: yes
john: he's telling the truth
keith: awww i thot u hate those kiddies

I CANT HANDLE THIS EUGENE IS ACTUALLY SOFT IN THE INSIDE
#johnjoinsthetryguys
There reactions in the background make this extra fantastic
"i dont know those babies"
the way he says "everyone knows you like fried chicken" at 6:30 😂
Eugene's face is looking so chiseled and nice in this video wow. I mean it always is but more so than usual
Everyone knows Keith is the best, even Keith!
The tester dude is scary
John is me
thing is lie detectors aren't that reliable
all these dark sides of Eugene
Guys do u rebember there take on survival i wish they can do it again but with everyone there!
Now I really ship Eugene and Zach
John seemed so unenthusiastic and like he didn't want to be there
when Zach said "Everything's a toy if u play with it" I think I found my new life motto
Wow, the more I learn about Eugene the more sympathy I feel for him. He had a tough childhood and is insecure even though he acts like he is the best and knows he is loved and handsome. I know everyone's mentioned it, but when Eugene said he didn't know how much the Try Guys cared about him my heart broke. :'(
Why did they ask Eugene if he wanted to f**k them? lyk is he gay?! Is this the confirmation we've been looking for?
this is bull,the polygraph is highly unreliable. anyone can pass it,all it takes is a lack of conscience,Gary Ridgway the green river killer passed a polygraph,O.J simpson passed a polygraph, along with some others...so this so called test,means absolutely nothing,yet in some states they can use it to establish probable cause for further legal measures
John is scurry
Do this again!
okay but can we talk about how Eugene doesn't believe in true love??
"He's telling the truth"
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 😂😂
My perspective of Ned went from 0-100 real quick
Keith is the best try guy
John is a westboro baptist church member I feel lol
Eugene is so hot in this video.
To me some of them seem so sad sometimes.
Like Eugene and Keith..
0:30 LYING MAKES YOU GO TO HELL
What about Try Guys Try Extream sports or rock climbing
😂😂😂"I'll kill you right here right now"
John looks over
"I'll kill you right here"
John, you are my hero.
John is evil!
why is john me
That was their funniest!!!!
Ned is a terrible liar
"Do you ever want children?"
"Yes"
I VOLUNTEER
Make John a try guy.
7:23 I felt you eugene!!!! cos we're INTJ squad!!
"God hates liars." What an ignorant statement...
When Eugene said he genuinely didnt believe in true love I got so sad!
Why is John so serious? Not to mention he sounds so monotone 😂
I have 2 favorites Keith and Eugene
Lie detectors are inaccurate...
Did... John just lowkey imply he was... god???
"ill kill you right here" -John
this line is the one line john said to him when he died
Zach is dan today
John is a savage
This is so entertaining
John is psychopathic I love it
"I'll kill you right here"
Zac and Ned are my favorite :)
It turned out very weird at around half way through the video
I was waiting for the staff to break out into laughter after that "god hates liars, and so do I" but it just cut to the title screen and I was like "....well okay then"
I relate SO MUCH to Eugene.
PROTECT EUGENE AT ALL COSTS
THIS VIDEO MADE ME BOTH HAPPY AND SAD THE ENTIRE TIME LOL
john scares me
He looked so damn depressed
Isn't this the same lie detector guy from Nathan for You?
I think we learned the most about Eugene here, and the heartache is real for his unknowingness of the love the Try Guys have for him.
Too bad that lie detector dosn't work :)
Do you believe in true love? No. (truth) 5 min later I believe in your love!
Someone please make a fan fiction of Zach and Eugene
"I don't know those babies" lmaooo😂😂😂
" I don't know those babies " 😂
I love Eugene and the emo lie detector guy
"I'd kill her"
"God hates liars and I hate liars" HAHAH I LOVE HIM
"Do you like Engine's Dogs?" Yeah I do like Engine's Dog"
He's so intimidating jeez 😂
I think Eugene is the best try guy XD
Actually God loves the sinner but hates the sin (lie)
Polygraphs. Don't. Work.
I ' l l  k i l l  y o u  r i g h t  h e r e
God zaxk is so freaking cute!!!!! I love his reactions
"God hates liers, and I hate liers." Eye roll.
THIS NEED TO BE LONGER OR HAVE MORE PARTS
I don't know wtf it was but when Eugene said no when they asked if he knows how much they care abt him I literally teared up
The dectector guy was so serious
john scares me... also love how deep and srs things got!
john is my fav now he should have his own channel
I thought Kieth was going to say that Kieth was his favorite try guy
Everyone loves Keith <3
FEH BOY!!!
Part 2 to this
I've seen John everywhere
Damn john so serious.
"I'll kill you right here."
Zach reminds me of murr from the impractical jokers 😱
This. This video has made me laugh the most ever from a buzzfeed video.
Zach looked so innocent as the goes "do you think I'd make a good husband?"
Is Eugene a Capricorn?
I grew up Catholic 😂😂😂
Its all fun and games till ned asks if they ever thought about his wife...😂
"I'll kill you right here" I almost fell out of my chair laughing because of how serious he was. 😂
John is my new best friend
Guys Eugene wants kids....
John scares me
WAS THAT A PARKS AND REC REFERENCE AT THE END????!!!!!
0:30 john is god confirmed
"I'll kill you right now."
Omg.
keith: i don't like any dogs







i died a little inside
The man is against lying but he's all game for murder? Interesting
How does John keep a straight face
Adam ruins everything comes in
John is what makes this
Zach is adorable
John is my spirit animal.
John is so mean!
3:53 SAME
"God hates liars and I hate liars"

You trying to imply something?
The thought of being able to tell if people are lying seems horrifying.  Lies are told for a reason.
Ned is absolutely self-absorbed
5:17 IM DYING
ned: i dont know those babies
See now, that polygraph guy was wrong god doesn't hate anyone even if they don't belive in him he doesn't hate then jealous is just disappointed in them
the try guys are my spirit animals
I knew Keith likes Zach the most:')
Try guy " orphans or wife"
Man "I would kill her"
A lie detector does not determine if you are lying or not
Zach asked the best questions
"I'll kill you right here."
this is so good
Do you ever want children 
Eugene: yes
oohhh i thought you hated little babies
Lie detector tests are pseudoscience at best. Anyone can fool a lie detector, just stay calm.
That part where Eugene said hair is the only thing people told was good about him and then Keith said he didn't even had that, is where i was the saddest.
hdue
Everyone's like who's your favorite then when they get to Eugene it's who do you like
I have to tell everyone a grave secret:





Lie detectors don't work. They measure stuff like your heartbeat and sweat patterns.
i'll marry you Zack
when they asked eugene if he wanted kids and he said yes i was like HELL YES he gon make beautiful babies
1:09 zach is too cute!!
the guy who says he's telling the truth sounds really mad
this is my favourite try guys episode
Omg when said I'd kill her I broke out into full blown belly clenching laughter
All hail the Zagene ship! 😂
THIS WAS SO FUNNY
I want John's wife to comment about him wanting to kill her
"God hates liars and I hate liars". John is God
ayyyyyy it's john!
john low-key really scares me
Who else knows ya boi John from All Def Digital
JOHN
The tall guy with the glasses looks like he should be on a rowing team at Harvard.
So are we all just going to ignore the pivotal existential epiphany about Keith and his fried chicken??? 😂🍗
What I've learned from this is that everyone loves Keith.
If Keith gave up fried chicken, he could still have a breast and a thigh, wink wink
That was great! :D
In Keith's defense, he is the is the best.
4:29 "We should have a black member right?"
Consider this YouTube comment my application
Eugene seemed slightly arrogant at face value, this changed my whole view of him.. and well, as for ned? ...[insert poop emoji]
Buzz feed more like this please more like this
Keith is sick even when he's selfish.
John dude chill out 😂😂😂
when they talked about Johns marriage omg that was my favorite part. x3
this was awesome, funny, entertaining, and heartwarming all rolled up into one
Eugene is actually really insecure...
That's so sad as he seems to be a great guy
Polygraphs don't actually detect lies, the human brain is too complicated. The polygraph measures heart rate, breathing, blood preassure and sweating which can be caused by a stressfull question giving a false positive. Good night.
turn down the music volume... my house is shaking just to hear them talking
Okay my question is who did Zach make out with???
are they all gay?
zach: "do you think i'd make a good husband"
ned: smiles and stares deeply into the camera for a very long time
ned: ....yes...
john: he's lying

the rest of them dying in the background had me laughing so hard
Did he say dog hate liars and also i hate liars or Did he say god hates liars??
Actually it has been proven that lie detectors are not accurate and honestly should not be used at all
Oh god I would never agree to this!!!
pseudoscience
''God hates liars, and i hate liars.''
John is lying.
OBVIOUSLY EUGENE IS THE BEST TRY GUY
Is it just me or is anyone else actually concerned or terrified with the guy.
HOW THEY WEAR THE SUITS THO XD
lmao buzzfeed always uses hall of the mountain king for background music
I'm gonna be honest I hate Ned
Doesn't seem like that guy has depression
Eugene has his tie loose me: YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
gotta get that 10 minute ad revenue buzzfeed
"I'd kill her" dead😂
I really wanna try this with my freinds XD
Can we have a try guys vid where they try to make Eugene feel happy? Eugene has the most beautiful smile I have seen.
I LOVE JOHN
LOL John pls
I'm surprised that Eugene said "yes" to the child part even the other guys were surprised at that or maybe he's just good at lies 🤔
Wow "god hates liars, I hate liars"
this was so funny lol
7:18 Im Zach and all my friends are Keith... #SadLife
It's scary that john wasn't lying when he told Ned he would kill him😂
This was great
Somehow Keith turned out to be more devious than I thought
I will date Zach just to prove Keith wrong!! I've actually had a crush on Zach for as long as I've been watching Try Guys 😘
"I will kill you right here."  xD John is my favorite try guy
"I like being hooked up to machines"
I don't know those babies
OMG need is so cute "I-I dont kn-know" (btw not that kind of cute)
ADD JOHN TO TRY GUYSSS
John said God hates liars and i hate liars. 
Just that part 'God hates ...' made me not like him if you know what i mean. 
Not trying to be discriminating xD
That is some chemistry with these guys.
Do you believe in true love? 
Eugene: " no" 
Everyone "aww"
So Eugene believes in ghosts but not true love.. what has your mother done to you? What is she taught you about love..




W W WAIT HOLD UP FORGET ALL O THAT!! KEITH IS ENGAGED?!?!
"I kill her"- John
jon slays my life
Polygraphs don't work. They just test if you're nervous about subjects...
Where the hell did they find John?
I'll kill you right here ha ha
The lie detector guy is my spirit animal.
"I don't know any of those babies"💀😭
This just confirms that every man has gay thoughts from time to time.
Zachs laugh is adorable
when every other comment is about "we gotta be better about that" :|
Tea has been spilled.
God hates liars lmao
Eugene wants kids in the future! I am so hopeful for him.. he must believe in love after all. And being a child of divorce he won't let those kids down 😍
God hates liars and John hates liars
when zack said do u like neds dog who else thought he said ned stark?
Can we have a vote on who the favorite Try Guy is?
John is kinda creepy...
But I also kinda like it😂
gay and fake
Who's YOUR favorite try guy?
"Well, everything's a toy when yo play with it" -Zach 2017. So true tho
"Well, everything is w
I wish I could be in Eugenes life and like make him believe in love. He is so cool.
I love Keith and Zach!
John is a savage
I am commenting so much right now
This was such a good video!
Damn, Ned looks so cheeky when he is lying
Ned looks like a giggling school girl when he is answering the questions
John looks sad
that whole situation between Ned and john was hilarious with the whole marriage and wife thing 😂
"I'd kill her"
Who else knows John from ADD   ?
Eugene is hilarious
The try guys is just a perfectly balanced squad. 
1. Dog person (Eugene, Ned) vs Cat person (Zach, Keith)
2. In a relationship (Ned, Keith) vs Single AF (Eugene, Zach)
3. Competitive/Challenging (Ned, Eugene) vs Friendly/Cuddly (Zach, Keith)
4. A bit too confident (Ned, Keith) vs A bit insecure (Eugene, Zach)
Well except that Eugene's the only asian dude, child of divorce, and the only guy with that damn sexy hair.
If John's been a polygraph examiner for so long he should know that it doesn't actually detect if someone's lying. It just checks things like pulse to see how nervous they are so someone can be telling the truth but have anxiety and the polygraph would say they're lying. Same thing goes the other way around, many criminals have just stayed calm while telling lies and gotten away with it
Best Try Guys episode ever
I NEED A CLIP OF WHEN HE GOES I don't need your EXplanAtion
"I don't know those babies"
"I don't know those babies"
Kieth is gross.
as i learned in Lie To Me,  polygraphs say you're lieing if you show a rise in a certain emotion. the emotion Eugene could of felt might have been disgust, not sexual arousal.
Keith is my favorite 😂
"God hates liars and I hate liars" lol I find myself saying this alot
Lie detector are just meant to scary criminals into making them tell the truth
I enjoyed this
Have you not seen the Adam ruins Lie Detector Tests?
LMAO!! XD XD XD
I bursted out laughing when John was like "God hates liars, and I hate liars." like damn boy, you need a hug? who hurt you?
Keith doesn't like dogs...  :'(
moment of hope for women willing to have the "kiddies" for Eugene. :)
the detector guy didn't even smile for the whole video
John is literally me
"God hates liars, I hate liars." - John
😂😂😂
that lie detector guy was a little severe.......like chill dude...
Eugene says he doesn't believe in true love and my crazy girl brain was like "I will teach him". Then I found out he prefers dogs over cats, nah.
did you know polygraphs don't actually work that well
Eugene in the suit is perfection
Zach is my spirit animal.
Why is their reaction so delayed after John said I'd kill her???
"Everything is a toy if you play with it" DAMN WHAT IS MY MIND
John is scary.
A common misconception with lie detectors is that people assume they give instant magical results.. The truth is it's the person operating the system that's impt and how well you know the person who is taking the lie detector test.

People hooked up should go through a mock test to assess their behavior and physiology by being asked a few questions that are very obvious yes or nos. The more questions asked the more the assessor has data to work with.

Not too sure whether the try guys did it behind the scenes but in any case I would assume John is pretty accurate considering the Try Guys did not dispute much.

But definitely not 100% conclusive.
john will forever be in my nightmares
I really enjoyed this
The Try Guys, please, make a video of you reading fanfiction about you!!!
The examiners initial statement is not true. He says that god hates liars. God doesn't hate anyone no matter what they've done. He is incapable of hating, he loves everyone whether they lie, cheat or even murder.
Try Guy, Worth it, & Unsolved are the things holding up buzzfeed
Holy f* this was a good episode!
OMG this is the best one yet!
Then there's just Zach holding a lollipop.
John...wow. I wanna kill him too.
John was so serious oh my god
my heart somehow broke when NED said that it (their sweet married couple image) was anyway for show like ned was my favorite bc hes sweet and all but I also had this feeling that it was for show and this proves it huhu im brokn
why is nobody talking about how the polygraph examiner said "god hates liars, and i hate liars."
Eugenes getting serious questions while the others are like HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT OF PUTTING DICKS IN YOUR MOUTH
Did you know? Lie detector tests do not work.
Oh, ned got fu@#ed up'!!!
"GOD HATES LIARS " Woah there
there should be a black guy in the group
John is such a savage...but his beard..its so majestic..
Jon is a savage...But his beard is so majestic..
John killed me😂😂😂😂😂
ok Eugene wants children ... :D that made me happy for no reason ....can i be the mother? /._./
6:18 thank me later
John though
'no one likes nuns, Eugene.' falls of bed *
everybody's talking about 'we've got to be better about that' but nobody's talking about 'do you think you're the best tryguy'? Zach: '..no'.
I legit cried. He's so precious.
Can John be in more videos? LOL
i want to do this omg
Eugene saying he doesn't know how much the other guys care for him and that his hair is the result of his insecurities because he doesn't seem himself as attractive broke my goddamn heart.
Wait, are Eugene gay or not? Can someone please tell me that. No offend if he is!
is Eugene gay?
john is my favorite he so serious
I want to take a test so bad!
I WANT TO MARRY ZACH JUST PLEASE LET ME MARRY ZACH HES SO cuTE AND LIKE AWKWARDLY SEXY ): IM
Eugene omg! 😍
WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAINST ITALIAN KIDS OML
Lie detectors don't work properly. It's fake
These things arn't 100% right. Only a joke of a justice system would take them serious in any way.
now can we get a video with one of those professionals like the "Lie to me" ones going through their day and pointing at the camera whenever they're lying?
eugene is the best try guy
Keith is the best liar. CONFIDENCE!!!
why is the comments filled with girls :)
Do you think I'd make a good husband, *yes * lies because Ned is a friend of Zac 😂
Erm... should we check if The Try Guys, especially Ned is still alive? John seems............ nice... :)
Zach×Eugene, I ship it. Let's get it a name. Maybe Zagene?
Do you think I will ever find love  "yes" *lies because it's his best friend 😂 poor Zac
God?
JOHN IS SCARY AF. LIKE IF I HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE PREDATOR AND JOHN....
"i like being hooked up to machines" LMAO
polygraphs are honestly so easy to fool

all you have to do is stay calm and control your heart rate and breathing
A try guy wanting to have sex with another try guy. Don't believe in this bs machine. It gives completely false answers if you take classes on how to beat it. You can lie everything and it will say it's the truth.
LIE DETECTORS CAN BE COMPLETELY INACCURATE!! AND THEY HAVE PEOPLE TRAINED TO BEAT THEM!! THEY CAN SAY COMPLETE LIES AND THE MACHINE WILL READ YES!! So if a machine says did you cheat on your wife and the guy says no. the machine will catch his nervousness as a yes. So it is very unfair. and no interrogation officers use it as credible but they do use it for weak minded people for confessions.
I hate this because they always so fake . The older man does it for comedy purposes of course
When they were asking who was there favorite I'm surprised Keith didn't say "KEITH"
Literally anyone: "buzzfeed makes the best, unbiased videos."
Lie detector: BEEP BEEP MUTHAFACKA
Lie detectors are proven to be bull
When Ned said marriages usually fade, it reminded me of last night when my partner and I were out with our friends. We kissed and smiled and one of them said "ugh I can't stand you guys. You've been together for so long how do you still love each other?" We laughed so hard XD   (This guy is in a ridiculous on-off relationship with an emotionally abusive girl, so his views are loosely based off of stereotypes and commonality.) Hilarious joke, though.

That moment when you try to explain good relationships to someone, but can't stop laughing.
The administer is scary as hell.
POLYGRAPHS DONT WORK YOU GUYS. I mean for comedy's sake this was great, but yeah,  hope you knew that
John oh my god
this was way more awesome than I anticipated.
John should be a try guy
John is the best part of this video lmao
Lie detectors don't work
@2:50 he totally sounds like a women
Eugene looks so hot with his sleeves rolled up and his little black tie.
Zach: Hey, Keith? Do you like Ned's dog?
Keith: No.
Ned: ...wat
"Keith is telling the truth"
Keith again: I don't like any dogs!
Ned: You like Eugene's dog?
Keith: I do like Eugenes dog.
"Keith is telling the truth"
XD
$10 lie detector test vs $2500 lie detector test?
For real though, yall need a black member
that guy is so angry XD
Polygraph is not accurate :D
Okay how have they not done an escape room yet that's like the perfect try guy thing to do
No ones gonna mention Zach eating the lollipop the whole time
I missed steven
Eugene,every Try Guys video takes at least 2/3 of the comments about you,on how much you're awesome and we love you.

  So dang it man,feel the love,yo.
John is my favorite person in the world
I hate people who edit comments -
"everything's a toy if you play with it."

- zach "korndiddy" kornfeld
Okay, hold on!
Do we just act like Eugene didn't say "He likes to be hooked up to machines?! 

Please elaborate further?!
Greyhair guy is weird.
so whats the story behind zack's neck scar ?
John should be the new try guy
I see john everywhere 😭😭😭
would you kill the nuns or your wife
Ned: The nuns
The nuns: welcome to your tape
who else is terrified of John?!?!?!
Quite surprised with the questions asked.... they seemed very.... tame... Especially for the Try Guys...
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Eugene
I'll kill you right here!
i wanna test myself
I would hate to be john's daughter 
He would say where were you last night and strap me up to see if I was lying 😂😂😂
"God hates liars and I hate liars" help I'm scared
Johns life is sad
Proof Eugene is bi ☺️
the thing that's really sad about this video is john he doesn't smile
John is a lowkey psychopath
the lie detector guy seems so done
john is hilarious lmao
John is so stone faced.
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" well, this guy's a genious.
Polygraph tests are fake and can be really easy to fool many serial killers have passed a lie detector
my god i HATE buzzfeed sjw useless turds
think this is my favouritest try guys video yet hahha
Eugene, don't you dare replace anybody. DON'T YOU DARE!!!
Zach:They all go to me!
Me:COME TO PEN HEAVEN YES YES YES PEN HEAVEN
John is so enthusiastic
Lie detectors are flawed.
god doesn't hate liers he likes every whone
hmmm... never noticed that scar on Zach's neck before 🤥
The guy behind the lie detector is so serious lol😂😂😂
"he telling the truth"
"he's lieing"
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"God hates layers"...omfg
i don't know the babies killed me xD
LOOK AT ALL OF THE LIKES!
everything is a toy if you play with it <3
Zach in that white shirt...lord have mercy the things I'd do to him.
"I don't know those babies "😭
Damn, ned looks like moriarty in that brown shirt.
Zach is so damm cute awww
Question #1 Are you the f*ckboy
is your love for ariel for show ned said yes its kinda like instagram
I love how john can keep his facial expression as blank as possible during this
I love John so much.
This was excellent.
I liked this video, there isn't enough Eugene & Zack love.
I don't know those babies
When he said "god hates liars i hate liars" I was like "it was only a banana on a bush"
God hates liars and I hate god
NED: "boat full of orphans, or your wife"
JHON: "I'd kill her"
ME: bursts out laughing to the point that my parents are like SHUT UP
Next Episode of Try Guys, we cherish Eugene more, and make sure he knows!!
Eugene is so hot!
"God hates liars...and I hate liars!"

So basically he hates himself... (cause there is no god cough cough)
Sometimes Keith can be evil LOL
i think this john is also the same one in the real talkshow
John is like the final boss in a horror game...
At 9:14 when Zach had to answer if he was the best made my heart melt because he had to think about it even though as fans of the try guys we can answer and definitely say yeah he is the best but maybe because he was really thinking and had like a sad moment there where he had to pause
"Nobody likes nuns, Eugene. I grew up catholic"
"God hates liars, and I hate liars." Does that make you God?
feels like the guys are losing momentum, I mean alot of these videos are too familiar to other buzzfeed videos, everything they've put out recently has been kinda "meh"
John should have been separated into another room or at least not listen to their conversation!
I hope John's wife isn't watching. lol
Zach is seriously cute!  He is clearly the cutest of the other Try Guys and I bet that makes them jealous.  At least it should as he is that adorable.
This and the therapy session are probably the best Try Guys videos.  I love when you get personal and uncomfortable.
Eugene we think you're amazing! <3
John: "I'd kill her"....Lmao I died😂😂
Do they know that the polygraph dosen't work?
One of the best try guy videos
Gosh, I wish I could give Eugene a hug. I feel like I relate to him in so many ways.
lying makes you go to hell
When zach laughs at 1:12 lol
"I don't know those babies"
I'm imagining of Eugene x Zach = Babies
I DON'T THINK JOHN WAS JOKING.
Conclusion: Keith is egoistical
'God hates liars, and I hate liars' wtf? why don't I trust this polygrap dude?
Here are the results, I only used the ones where John specifically said it was truth or a lie.
Keith: 3 lies, 10 truths
Zack: 4 lies, 5 truths
Ned: 3 lies, 6 truths
Eugene: 2 lies, 11 truths

I was just curious. I know there are other variables to truth/lie detection but just based on what you can see from a polygraph these are the numbers for what we saw in the video.
Am I the only one who wants to jump in the screen and hug Eugene?
:Ned trying to explain how his marriage is better then John's:
:John: turns head towards Ned 
John: I can kill u right here

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
After this the group broke up 😂
john is the best man here
Kys
eugene's answers just make me want to hug him or just like drink obscene amounts with him (feel like he would more appreciate the later)
gotta get that ad revenue by coincidentally making the video 35 secs longer than 10 minutes
well john serious
John is my favourite try guy
"Everything's a toy if you play with it"
"Everything's a dildo if you're brave enough"
My grandmother from the Philippines is definitely a witch of some sort so I feel ya Eugene
"I'll kill her" IM DYING
I hope I find a woman that I love so much that I'll save her from a burning sinking boat rather than a bunch of nuns holding Italian babies who are also orphans on a burning sinking boat.
Check out the "Adam ruins everything" episode on Forensic Science to see the truth about lie detectors.
i smiled throughout the whole video
I mean of course Keith thinks he's better everyone else is wearing a white shirt and a tie and he's wearing a blue shirt😂
"I don't know those babies" 😂😂💀
7:57 when the best part of this video started. Oh boy, do I love Ned
😂😂😂 this is my favourite vid of all time
Some of these questions went really deep.
WHEN ZACH PULLS THE LOLIPOP OUT IN THE BEGINNING IM CRYING
So, Ned... best you start running for four different countries now.
Polygraph tests weren't invented to detect lies, they were invented to test heart rate, blood pressure and other medical factors
"A boat full of newborn Italian babies" 😂😂😂
"I don't need your explanation" - Keith

I was dying
this is a heavy one
god hates liars and i hate u
I agree with John about killing my spouse xD 

the most talented person in the group does not think he is...why were Eugene's answers all sad.
💜 this 😂
Zach: "do you think you have a better marriage than John?"
Ned: "I assume so, yeah."
John: welcome to your tape
Why is John so goddamn serious?
hes telling the truth
"Anythings a toy if you play with it" 😂😂
i love how they all like keith the best and he thinks hes the best try guy, like they're not wrong he is the most pure soul of them all hahaha
We talk about how funny the guys are in this video, but John was HYSTERICAL.
This is the old Buzzfeed crew that's why it's a good video. Take note Buzzfeed. Constantly replacing your video producers because of your stringent requirements for your employees is gonna ruin you some day. Mark my words. People dislike change, they want to see Gabby, Allison, Zach, Ned, etc.
why dont they do lie detector tests with police?
Who else wants to see more of these XD
"Do you think I've ever find love?"

Keith: "yeah!"

Keith is lying

I'm dying 😂😭
God loves everybody but hates there sins. So John is giving us false information.
Though I loved some of, Keith's answer, Zach had the best line at the very end when he said, "Everything is a toy if you play with it."
I love how they still love each other
"I dont know those babies"
The polygraph test dosen't work.
"I don't know those babies" I love Ned!! lol
hate is such a strong word I would say god dislikes liars you should choose your words wisely
do you guys know that the lie detector doesn't detect lies is just detect sweat , heart beat , blood pressure , what happens if they just workout?
I just looked Ned's wife Ariel Fulmer and my goodness, she is really beautiful!! 
Also I love her coz she has a crafty/design type job, I personally love knitting/crochet Ravelry.com  some of the great Hedgehog Fibres/ Countess Ablaze/ Madelinettosh yarns you can get these days, it's art, and the pieces they make are just about fabulous enough for cute and funny guys like the Try Guys!! (I mean look at how well the designer Stephen West wears it lol).
eugine is the best so sexy
Eugene looks so damn hot here
kk
He looks so depressed in his job. And yes I'm telling the truth.
John is HIGHKEY creepy
Please add John to the try guys.... he's a young savage and he's trapping so hard
why does eugene remind me of josh dun??
Lie Detector tests dont work and are terrible
jhon has no chill! hahaha
God hate liars  and i hate liars  , amen to that🙌🏻❤
Eugene wants childeren. Fuken take mine now goddd
john is my bae.
Awww, Eugene wants kids! I volunteer as a tribute!

Also, I could've told almost all of these answers, guys :D
that Polygraph examiner is a little intense there in the beginning sounds like a serial killer who stalks his victims subdues them and puts them through "the examination" if they fail that's when the rusty hacksaw comes out
Lie detector tests are proven to be wrong. Eg, Adam ruins everything.
why is eugene the asian guy in the green hornet?
angry christian
Best. Try guys.  EVER!!!!!
DO 👏🏾 THIS 👏🏾 WITH 👏🏾 LADYLIKE👏🏾
Woooooooowwwwwwww 100k thumbs up yassssss!
lol "I don't know those babies"
lmao i love John 😂😂😂
Guys the polygraph machine doesn't work it's fake watch Adam ruins everything's episode on it it's really interesting
PART 2 PLEASE
When they all started cracking up after John said "I'll kill you right here" I lost it
John sounds like a robot😂
John was just so unfazed by everything, it was hilarious! Seriously I just looked at his face to see his reaction.
im scared of john
For all we know this guy is playing pac man and just saying "Lie!" "Truth!"
The setup tho😂
Lie Detectors are BS, a nervous person could easily be identified as a liar and a calm person who's lying can't be detected. Also even if it could work it would be useless with questions that deal with complicated emotions ie "do you love your wife?" it seems like an easy question, but if your nervous about responding  it'll will give you a false report and if you had an argument recently it would also mess with the results.
Eugene wants children! Omg. I would have never thought such a thing!
'God hates liers'

What is it with Americans and bringing God into literally everything they do. Talk about indoctrinated.
Zach: You think you have a better marriage than John?
Ned: I assume so, yknow.. he's older, marriages tend not to get as good" 
John: "I'll kill you right here"😂
Eugene ...U don't need a token black guy in the group
Haha polygraph tests don't work
"Do you believe in ghosts" 

Imao Keith's face 😂😂
John: "I'll kill you right here" 

Imao I can't 😂😂
Best episode imo
Concentrate
Keith: "Do you think I'm ever going to find love?"
Zach: "Yea!"
Poly guy: ".....Keith is lying"
hi
God hates lies and I hate lies.
Zack: Do you ever think I'll find love 
Keith: No 
Ned: No 
Zack: Welcome to your tapes
I just really want to hug Eugene even more now. He's a good cupcake.
hes telling the twuth
Very personal questions:
"Do you like Ned's dog?"
Eugine should get with a hot girl and settle down, attractive guys and attractive girls should get together more often.
Eugene needs a hug :(
Hey it's John from ADD
I was really hoping John (examiner) to say: God hates liars and I hate liars, I am God.
Got to be my fav video of the try guys XDD
They should've checked clearly whether Eugene wanted on Zach XDD
"I don't know those babies" 😭
Zach if you want love so bad I'm single
I will kill u right here 😄😅😆
7:03 do u think ull ever marry. Yea he's telling the truth. then why u give me so much s**t about it
Eugene is a child of divorce????
John must be lots of fun at party 🎉
i'm a nun so i'll neat the hell outta you 3
John does not look like a guy id want to run into in a dark alleyway...
7:46 best laugh ever!
The lie detector does not work
Ultimate lie rule to pass any lie detector: lie close to the truth and be like Deadpool and not care about the question, lie, truth or even yourself in the moment of the question. Or just believe in the lie so your heart rate doesn't jump.
the tester scares me
EUGENES HAIR WAS THE ONLY THING COMPLIMENTED WHEN HE WAS YOUNG??!!! well screw those people now Eugene is the hottest ever 🙌🏼
Keith:"John is lying, that's true" 
John:"Keith is lying"
I need 10 hours of this not 10 minutes come on buzzfeed understand us please.
This was hilarious!!!
john is the best man
I wish this was more personal 😹
Does Eugene remind anyone else of Magnus (from Shadowhunters)?
Eugene was the HOTTEST!!!
when the other try guys asked keith who his favourite try guy was, i thought he was going to say himself lol 😂
John is an intense guy
They should make a show where women or men think that their lover is charting in them and they question them using the polygraph
They should make a show where women or men think that their lover is charting in them and they question them using the polygraph
I no longer see ned as the sweetest man ever when he admitted it's only for show.
"God hates liars, and i hate liars" Omg, thats.. xD scared me
Lmao
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."
... This suddenly took on a much more serious tone 😅😅😅😅
I feel like the lie detector is so fake
Ned: Do you believe in true love ?
Eugene: No
Me neither, this is so relatable™
I totally understood "Ned stark" at 7:40 and didn't get why "dog" came up afterwards...
no way I give up fried chicken :o
I'm pretty sure the Try Guy Eugene wants to have sex with is Eugene.
john needs to be a try guy xD
When buzzfeed steals all digital defs idea mmm really good 👌
I love how John sounds like a robot

' KEITH  IS  TELLING  THE  TRUTH'
funny to watch, but these machine is not very accurate .
The lie detector doesn't work, it's just made you to be scared shitless enough to make you confess
It's so weird that Keith doesn't like dogs. Just seems... wrong.
10:16 was that a parks and rec reference?
When you watch too much Adam Conover
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Lie Detector is not 100% always correct when you are nervous mostly LIE
I love how everyone act like cops in a movie and then zach shows up with a lolipop
that guy is from ADD
Lie Detectors don't work
I would make out with korndiddy.
Eugene... Believes in ghosts, but not true love. Me af
Eugene I wanna hug you !!! It makes me sad that he feels that way .
I laughed during all of this.
"I don't know these babies"
"I don't know these babies" omfg savage
this squad is my fave
Everything is a toy if you play with it
"I don't know those babies"
When Ned mentioned Becky Keith's face lit up ❤️
Just like any other Instagram couples, fake affections are just for showing off, in which Ned has admitted to it.
who hurt you john
john is my favourite try guy
lie detectors read too much anxiety from pulses are are not nor have they ever been a reasonable source of testimony or conviction. However it is really fun to use as a game and some boding, these guys are so adorable. Like when they felt bad Eugene didn't necessarily trust their affection. And all their relationship chatter.
Keith: I don't like any dog
Ned: Do you like Eugene's dog
Keith: Yes I like Eugene's dogs
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What if John is lying? 😱
7:22 "GAMMIT QUICHE"
NED WTF NUNS ARE BADASS
Is this john from ADD?????
keith should have said keith
This was amazing!
The Try Guys play ice-skate
I guess John is Toto the truth teller....








If anyone gets that reference you're a legend
John is likely the only real criminal in the room, though the cameraman must remain suspect. Seriously, John is an imposter because the circumstances of the tests are nothing like those required for a Polygraph to be legit. 

The test has absolutely no authenticity but then it really only mirrors most of the Polygraphs ever given. Why do you think that they are not used in any other country bar America and ever there they are not admissible in court?
It's kinda sad that eugene doesn't believe in true love but wants to have kids cause doesn't that kinda mean that he'd want to get married but he expects it to go wrong someday and get a divorce..?
everythings a toy if you play with it
zach is so cute HAHAHAHAHA
Zach and Eugene anyone?
Awe Eugene, he's really hurt
You know who they need in the Try Guys? JOHN.
I WANT TO KNOW WHO ZACH MADE OUT WITH!! ALL THREE OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!!not meant to sound creepy, I'm just really curious.
MY HEART DURING THIS VIDEO!"I believe in Ned and Ariel's love""Do you know how much we care about you!""Do you think I'll find love?""Yes I want children"
since english isn't my native language, so i really want sub-title which is not the auto one
john is so serious
Funniest parts of the video we're seeing the rest of them in the background laughing at whoever was hooked up to the lie detector
Polygraphs r a myth
polygraph tests are not accurate at all
"I'll kill you right here" lolol the way he turns to him
I hope Eugene works out his issues!!!
lol the lie detector guy gives me weird vibes.
Dzuma... Dzuma...
Aww Eugene :(
I love the try guys but I love John even more
OMG !
Try guys need 1 black 1 white 1 Asian and 1 jew
I'm living for John's monotone voice
more!!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars." I thought he was going to say "therefore, I am God" lmao
Without Keith, The Try guys wouldn't be as funny! 1:04
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 

Yikes. See y'all in hell.
They should add a black member, tbh.
John does not want to be there.
John only says Keths name when he's telling the truth. 'Keth is telling the truth'. And with the others he doesn't
the guy doing the test seems so miserable
John I felt like he was like just get out
John is like a real life Ron Swanson and I love it so much
plot twist: Eugene doesn't belive in true love and thinks Ned gonna divorce because he is having affair with Ariel. Lap dance episode, I'm looking at you!
When ned  says everyone hates nuns I grew up catholic  😂 I relate to that sooooo much lol
i like keith best too :D
I LOVE JOHN OMG CAN HE BE A PART OF THE TRY GUYS
He's tellin the troooot
"It's not a toy"😂
#johnforpresident
Don't worry Ned, I don't like nuns either
I wonder which people Zach made out with... ;)
I friggin LOVE John!
Wow.... 
Half an hour after the upload, there were only 87 views. 
Now 12 hours later, there's 2.1 million views!!!😵
Everyone likes Keith, he's the best. :')
John is my new favorite try guy
They should ask John to join the Try guys 😂
"I don't know those babies"
"It's not a toy" my Grampa 😂
They need to do a weird eating challenge!
funniest thing ive seen on youtube for a looong time! saving this for later
I could watch 5 seasons of this and still not be bored. Because the questions would get weirder and weirder.

"Would you date an elephant for a month if it would cure cancer."
"Hell yeah! Cure cancer!? I would MARRY that damn elephant."
"How about in heels?"
"Oh, no. Beep that."

". . . . . . .He's telling the truth. . . ."
I think this was my favorite try guys video, and I think it was because they've shot so many videos and accumulated so many inside jokes that the humor created itself. wouldn't have been funny earlier on. 

also john. 😆😆
"God hates liars and I hate liars" OMG HE IS GOD😱😱
4 useless worms wasting oxygen da faq
This was awesome! Love that it wasn't super short.  I hope they do this again sometime!!
John reminded me of Ron from parks and rec
"I don't know those babies." OMG! Ned is a savage! But he's a savage in love. <3
I ship Keith and Eugene
"I'll kill you right here"
litterly could not stop laughing XD John is killing me
Polygraph tests are fake
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."
Respect earned.
ZACS LAUGH IS SO CUTE AT 1:23
"I dont know the babys" oh god i laughed too hard
Eugene likes to hook up to machine ladies.  😏
God hates liars. John hates liars. John is God.
god hates lies and I hate lies. therefore, I am god.
wow OK why
The Lie Guys
Keith is the best try guy though!
Eugene seemed so meloncholic the entire video :( I hope he's doing alright
Dude John looked so pissed for some reason
John is my constant mood tbh 😂😂😂
Lie detector results are not admissible in court due to their inherent unreliability.
john was prob questioning eugenes sanity
eugene i swear you look like my classmate
GOD Eugene looks so hot in the suit
I can't possibly be the only one who doesn't like (is terrified of) john
This was better than I thought it was
that old guy is............
I don't have words for him
Do it again
JOHN IS SO BLUNT ITS HILARIOUS
for your next try you video you should: try guys have long hair for a week
What do Lie Detectors and Buzzfeed have in common?...  :o




People think they work but they really don't.  ;3
So who's gonna be the black guy????
Eugene is the cutest one and he doesn't lie (barely)
Eugenes so stone cold
John is my favourite try guy
LOL! When the whole comment section is comments from John
That "Do you think you have a better marriage then John" was the most hilarious question and Neds explanation!! 😂😂😂
That was so rude on what they said about the nuns. So sad.
aw I ship Zach and Eugene ♥
John reminds me of Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation.
I love john omg
this is like REALLY the best episode of the try guys <3
I love the try guys 😂💕
LOL, John is like Huck from Scandal 😲😲😲
I'm the same as zach. I never answer yes or no questions with yes or no
You guys do realize that it's easy to misguide a polygraph. It's not reliable
I want a completely unedited version of this.
Polygraphs don't work.
Oh, my gawddddd this has to be my top Try Guys video ever. These questions are seriously so deep, I just can not! Like my mind was blown on many of the guys answer vs. the truth like wuhh.... 
Good job guys.
This gave me so much laughter, I LOVE IT!
Ned:rambles about how he thinks shawns marrige is worse than his. 
Shawn: ill kill you right now
7:22
aaaaawwww 
😢
i feel like Keith has been engaged forever
Keith to Ned: "Are any of those just for show?"
Ned: "Yeah, sure."

I feel so betrayed.
"I like being hooked up to machines"
EUGENE NO
"Keith is lying" zach laughs "I wouldn't want on my chest." OHHHHHHH get rekted Zach OHHHH
God loves everyone
Idk what it is but i love this Lie detector guy xD
Woah, 2 million views in one night😮✨🎉
ok John is all together hilarious and frightening!
Does anyone else think Zack looks like he has more hair in this video than the last one ?
Thank you john for being the best person alive ever.
john is scary
It's the give it a whirl fuckers
'do you believe in true love'
'no'

and here is my fav try guy
Damn Ned is looking good in this video, did he do something different with his hair?
God does not hate liars. He hates that they lie. Big difference.... and John, so should you. Follow the example of God you lie detecting maniac!!!
I'm The only one that wanna know who co-workers Zach kiss????
i don't know those babies
Awww, Eugene...
I like John, he's a cool dude
"keith is telling the truth"
"i don't know those babies"😂😂😂
then john was like i'll kill you right here but then he says he'd kill her
TRY GUYS DO ROLLER DERBY!!
Zack: Do you know how much the three of us care about you?
Eugene:.....No.
John: He's telling the truth.
Keith whispers: We gotta be better about that. 

Quietly sobs in a corner
"Everything is a toy if you play with it"  LOL he is right! ♡
lol i dont know those babies. but thats fucked up
Its older Billy Mays!
Keith you right
Damn all of Eugene's answer made me want to give him a hug
The way Zach was eating a lolly for the video
john was the true star of this try guys video
Every time I see a new video of the Try guys, I fall in love with Eugene even more. <3
Eugene doesn't believe in true love but he believe in Ned's love!!
Why do I love the scenery and the feel to it? Like a cop show.
john is my kind of guy
"God hates liars, and I hate liars." i was waiting for a i am god joke but nOO
Jon is like "I'll kill you right here"
Zach : "do you think I'll ever find love?" Keith: "yeah"  dude: "Keith is lying" 😂😂😭
Lie detectors are bs, many serial killers passed that tests just by being calm.
Jon is a streak savage
Ned is my fav :)
"I don't know those babies"
Eugene was just rude 😔 they all asked funny or cute questions towards themselves, but Eugene was asking questions that hurt the person and that's jut horrible
this is so funny!!!! well done buzzfeed lol
Lol you might as well flip a coin to know whether they are telling the truth
ADD ME TO THE TRY GUYS!!!!!
"ill kill you right on the spot"
sounds like a quote i said before
I love how the lie detector said God hates let's and so do I
Eugene and Zach?? Wyd
I love John. "I'll kill you right here" "I'd kill her"
Why is zach so hottt
"I'll kill you right here"
have the try guys try long acrylic nails for a day!!
John is one creepy mf .
John is convinced the try guys are going to hell.
"do you kill the Italian baby boat" I LOST IT IM SITLL LAUGHING
It kinda makes me sad that Eugene doesn't belive in love
Eugene is HOT AF
Is anyone else sick of the try guys?
Zach at 7:35 - 7:45, is totally me while watching this entire video 😂😂
8:23-
John: I'll kill you right here
Computer: John is telling the truth
Does John remind anyone else of the guy in 10 Cloverfield Lane? 👀
john is scary, but I love it 😂
"I'll kill you right here." 

He's telling the truth.
The INVENTOR of the "lie detector test" has said multiple times that's it is not accurate and should not be used to measure truth vs. lie, and yes, he has said this to the US government too.
Eugene's answers are kind of concerning....
...you know these things can be cheated yeah?  they are not actually detecting lies, just hot fast your heart is going or breathing... a sociopath can easily cheat the "lie detector"
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST VIDEO I HAVE EVER WATCHED
Make john a try guy.
Zach really did get the bad roll of the dice. balding, skinny, poor eyesight, excess amounts of body hair, oh and he has the weakest sperm of the try guys.
They pissed off john lol
Ned's mouth is his tell. Every time he lies he "frowns" to try and hide a smile.
"I like being hooked up to machines."
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." 
Those two like got me
I don't know why people are now shipping Zach and Eugene. I still ship Zach and Keith. Everybody loves Keith and Keith loves Zach
John is very intimidating.....
90% of what Eugene said is making  me sad I just   want  to MAKE HIM FEEL HAPPY
This is my favorite try guys video!
Damn it!! Ned is looking so sexy ultimately...
wrong. god doesn't hate.
They should have titled it the Lie Guys instead
THEY WERE ALL SURPRISED WHEN HE SAID HIS FIANCÉ OVER CHICKEN OMG 😂😂😂
let's be honest keith is the best try guy
should it maybe be called.. "the lie guys" ?
can I be that black addition to the try guys, a girl?
LOOOL JOHN WAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST
Wtf is eugene's story about his mother. She's psychic after sucking on a psychic teet in a war?
JOHN IS KILLING ME AHAHHA
So I totally think Eugene is just so good that he can lie to a lie detector.
John seems extremely bored...
Actually, polygraph tests are very unreliable, they can only detect physical factors such as heart rate and sweat which just means you're nervous. Being nervous doesn't mean you're lying, that's why polygraph tests are disputable in court and up to the judge's discretion. I urge you guys to learn more for yourself
Zach and Eugene.the ship has sailed.think ABOUT the fanfics
didn't Adam ruined the lie detector...and now they are using the same freaking thing...
Why are they all dressed like mr crocker??? Are they hunting FARIES
salt my dish bartender
Is Eugene wearing foundation in this video?
Poor John with all the Try Guys yelling.
John seems like the reason why he hates liars is because maybe his parents might have lied to him or also his friends lie.
I relate to Zach so much in this video 😂
When Keith said "we gotta be better about that" 😭
Polygraph tests don't work. It comes down to many factors, but if you are calm as you are normally, you'll pass, even if you do lie. There was also an Adam Ruins Everything episode on this (on YouTube). Search for it and watch that shizzle.
didn't you ever know the polygraph is extremely inaccurate.Check out it's episode on Adam ruins everything from collegehumour.
Polygraphs just measure sweat and heart rate?
It took me half the video to realise that they were changing shirts when it was their time
i don't like ned
God doesn't hate anybody John, chill.
can john be a try guy please
the lie detector guy is Ron Swanson plus 20 years
Love John! I want more of him! So funny!
We all love pesto.. the dog, not the sauce.. well the sauce too
hate to break this to you john but the polygraph does NOT WORK
7:30 korndiddy's laugh omg
Keith is secretly gay
Zach the playa!!!!!!!!!
Keith and Zach are the nicest in terms of personality while Eugene and Ned are driven by competition and are quite strict.
even though lie directors don't really work
I already shipped zach and Eugene and now I ship them even more
"What are these scenarios?" 
" I don't know those babies" 😂😂😂🤣😭😭
Anyone want me to post numerous studies all showing that polygraphs are total BS?
"Everything is a toy when you play with it" LOL Best way to end it Zach! Ahaha!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars.." 😂
7:31 
 Hey Keith, do you like Ned's dog?
No.  I don't like any dogs.
Do you like Eugine's dog?
I do like Eugine's dogs....
I love how John has such a straight face.
I've never noticed it before but Kieth looks like Tracy from the Tooth Fairy with Dwayne Johnson...
"god hates liars, and i hate liars." IM PEEINF OMFG JOHNN
"Do you think I'd be a good husband?"
"Yes..."
"He's lying"
i fuckin love this it's gold
Give john a Pepsi won't ya
John is great
7:15 though!!!
I'll kill you right here
LMAO
"do you know how much we care about you?' 
"... no"
"we gotta be better about that" 

  MY HEART IS HURTING EUGENE WE ALL CARE ABOUT YOU ALOT
Hi
EugenexZach sex tape
One of my favorite from the try guys 🙌🏼😂
That's why his hair's so big, it's full of secrets.
You ever look at a comment from a video that has a lot a likes and think "damn why didn't I say that"
john actually seems like a chill guy
This is intense
everytbings a toy if you play with it!
What I thought the comment section would be: The polygraph tests have been proven to be unreliable on so many accounts, due to it being one of the least scientific things still used to this day, so they ultimately mean nothing.

What it was: OMG I SHIP THESE GUYS SO MUCHHH
omg hahaha
Keith is the best!!
john: god hates liars and i hate liars
me: then you and god hate me because i lie a lot and by a lot i mean hmm...about over 1,000,000 times in my life
oh my god lie detector guy hes funny and so done with them xD
does this john guy have a youtube channel?
I like Eugene ❤️😂
zach and eugene should like get together
john maybe should like chill
"I don't know those babies"
Who hasn't thought about having sex with MY MAN Eugene.
John has been through some stuff
But they DON'T WORK. Hey it's funny tho.
Zach: "Eugene do know know how much the 3 of us care about you?"
Eugene: "No."
Polygraph Reader John: "He's telling the truth."
Keith: "We gotta be better about that"
!!!!!!!!!!!
Petition to add John to the Try Guys
"God hate liars"not much all are liers with reasons
I cried when Eugene said he didn't know how much they care about him. Poor Eugene. Usually he's bubbly and happy.
tbh... i ship eugene and keith.. they are the hottest out of all of them?
John scares me
Is he ok
Ned grew up Catholic. Happy Easter Ned :)
Eugene looked so cool and handsome answering those questions, he literally melted my heart. Guys he's just human too! He wants kids too!
Four reasons why I am still watching Buzzfeed 
1. Try Guys
2. Ladylike
3. Buzzfeed Unsolved 
4. Worth It
They should do try guys recreate the show silent library 🙃
Ned has a weird smile right before he lies
john has a lot of pent up anger. john needs a hug
Keith looks like a curious dad in this it's cute
More John!
I loved watching this.
so keith is everyone's favourite...haha cute
7:30
ahh
"Eugene do you know how much we care about you?"
"No."
"He's telling the truth"
"We've got to be better about that"
JOHN IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL I LOVE HIM
Is john is REALLY john?!?
I love that part when keith says "we've got to be better about that" when eugene does not know how much they care about him😢😍
Please!! I would love to see a part 2 to this!
No one's gonna talk about how Eugene wants kids? -
The best person in this entire video was john
John reminds me of Ron Swanson and I love it
"I don't know those babies.." oh Ned! 😂😂😂😂
What is a pickled cucumber?
John at 1:16 is making me so happy no wonder he'd kill his wife
I knew it john is god
Because we know polygraphs are just so goshdarn reliable.
8:19 John is the MVP
They say that keiths head grew three times that day
1 million views in 10 hours let's go try guys!
When Eugene said sex with Zac is gross
John the Savage: He's lying.

I also wish they'd get trained to try to fool the lie detector and the one to do it the best gets bragging rights.
when Eugene said no and Keith was like "we have to get better at that" my heart burst 😭😭
zach is a ladies man
favorite video so far
John is my spirit animal.
Zach is hot with that outfit!!
john is great. bring him back. more questions!
everybody loves Keith
MARRY ME EUGINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOST IT AT "GOD HATES LIARS, AND I HATE LIARS" LMAOOO
Lie detectors aren't real, they just focus on stress and they're not actual lie dectectors
i love john
why do i feel like they've done this before?
" I dont know those babies" lmfao!!!
eugene is so awesome- i lvoe his honestly! <3
hate doing this but... guys i just released a new song called "fuck.u" if u could listen to it, i would really appreciate it. Much Love<3

https://soundcloud.com/itsglake/fucku
"Nobody likes nuns, Eugene. I grew up Catholic." Lmfaoooooo I lost it at that!!!
I love it when John says "He's telling the truth."
I think John works for the Westboro Baptist Church on the side...😂😂
John really made me sad ahahah like his voice was so mono-toned, even when he said he'd kill the babies
I thought buzzfeed just wanted more money from try guys. I mean they made it into a youtube red exclusive
awh poor zack
I'm sorry but, lie detectors are a LIE
johns a real straight shooter. good man lol
JON IS MY FAVORITE PERSON😂😂
7:54-8:23 😂😂😂😂
I think John should join the try guys 😂hahaha he cracked me up so much
I love the profound moment when Keith says he'd give up fried chicken for the rest of his life to marry Becky, AND HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH! xD
wait wait, Eugene asked Keith if he want to put penises in his mouth or i misunderstood? 😮
Forget about Eugene..
I wanna give John a hug
Keith is the greatest
Who else is curious as to who Zach made out with ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Do people STILL not know that lie detectors DON'T work?
John Slowly Turns His Head I will kill you right here
Keith is my all time fav
"God hates liars and I hate liars." God doesn't hate anyone. He never has and never will.
That guy is from Add( All Def Digital)
He's lying
This was the most hilarious vidio
"I don't know those babies." - Ned. :3
"i don't know those babies" omg XD
My name is john and this here is my sis cough cough my uh my wife
<Inserts unoriginal comment that gets an unhealthy amount of likes>
When Eugene said he has a lot of secrets do you think he may have killed some people?
Did anyone else almost cry when they asked Eugene if he knows how much they care about him and he said no? And when Keith said with every ounce of seriousness, "We gotta be better about that." 😢😢😢
Make John a try guy 😂
The polygraph examiner reminds me of the one from ADD's Is it True series XD
Eugene is the most honest!
the amount of self control it took to not bust out laughing while watching this at 1 in the morning is huge😂😂😂
I wish buzzfeed employees were allowed to respond to comments.... This video has the best comments ever and I want to know their reactions!!!☹️☹️☹️☹️
Polographs are proven to be fake
I take psychology and in my class we talked about how lie detectors aren't credible, due to the fact that lie detector tests are based on physiological changes (I.e heartbeats and breathing), and habitual liars might not show any changes, while someone who's not lying might get nervous about the question itself, and appear to be lying even though they really aren't. Sorry to burst bubbles. Also, God doesn't hate anyone, so YOU'RE the one who's lying, John. ShAME
"God hates liars, and I hate liars" made me think "you really must hate liars to become a polygrapher" 😂
The dude is like "he's telling the truth" he's lieing "
"we've got stuff to deal with, you know... everybody does."

"i'll kill you right here."
I think John and I would be great friends, he had me at "And I hate liars"
Eugene is sooooooo fine!
johns my favorite
9:05 really wanted him to say Kieth...
I dunno those babies
Zach I'll marry you.
I love Eugene so much
Omg can john be a tryguy???? Please
Keith's favorite try guy is Keith
John should be on the try guys 😂
I want to give Eugene a big hug for the insecurities and hair comment. 😢😗😌 Let me love ya bby
"everything's a toy if you play with it" love it hahaha
Everything's a toy if you play with it
he hates liars and tests their honesty on the results or a machine that can't tell you 100% if someone is lying
I feel like John should now join the try guys
"eugene do you think that's weird?"

"no!"

"well it is."
Damn, Eugene is an Asian. Birdman ain't gon believe this.
I Also Hate Liars.. But i also have lied... so does the mean.. i hate myself...?
I remember watching this video..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................10 seconds ago..... XD
"I'll kill you right there." 
Me: OMG. Can he say that? Is that socially acceptable? He hasn't smiled one time in this video. Come on, John.
Zach's made out with 3 coworkers... there's 3 other try guys hMmmmMm....
I seriously thought Keith would say that his favorite try guy was himself.
my opinions on My Wife and Chicken and Rice plummeted in this video. I don't like them as much.
Anything to get to 10 minutes for ad revenue
Eugene is actual perfection
I don't think Eugene is hot. Sorry.
who hurt john
John creepy
Zach: "have you ever hooked yourself up to one of these and asked yourself questions in the mirror see what you truly believe 
John: "it's not a toy"
Zach: "well everything is a toy if you play with it." 
OMG ZACH!! 💕😂😂😂
JOHN LMAOOOOO
I loved this episode sooo much
"I don't know those babies" LOL 😂
whats the song at the end? aaa
This "Lie Detector Guy" is from "All Def Digital". Yall should check out All Def Digital, its a really good channel as well. #BlackPeopleHumor #Love
the polygraph doesn't work
The Try Guys tries drugs
Eugene omg 😂
buzzfeed not on trending omg 😱
"Do you know how much the three of us care about you?" 
"no"
"we gotta be better about that"
that was actually so sweet.
I LOVE JOHN EXCEPT FOR THE WHOLE GOD HATES LIARS IN THE BEGINNING
Can WE MAKE John THE newest try guy?
lie detectors are completeley innacurrate.
See, I wish Buzzfeed would stick to only these types of entertaining videos instead of the likes of "Questions _ People Have for _ People" which are so full of stereotypes and are racist behind a facade.
My new fav try guy vid😂
'I was born Catholic' 😂😂😂 me😂😂 hate nuns😂😂
John is my spirit animal
lie detectors don't work.
Are we ignoring Zachs a so posed office fuckboy
one more please!!
THIS WAS THE BEST!!! 'I'll kill u right here' ahahahahaha
i just want to know more about the story of the psychic
The dogs....hahah
John just trynna hide the fact that he's a lowkey freak
God hates liars... John hates liars

is john, god?
JOHN IS THE BEST PART OF THIS VIDEO
Polygraph's arent even a proper measurement of lies. they produce too many false positives (when someone's done it and the machine disregards it) and true negatives (when someone hasnt done it and the machine regards it) because it measures basic psychological levels like heartbeat and sweat and if someone's base measurements are faked (at the start) purposefully like through pain, then the rest of the questions will be 'oh he's not lying' vs. someone who's just naturally anxious because of the situation may be seen as lying.
"i like being hooked up to machines" Eugene 2017 😂😂😂
"I'll kill you right here" 😂😂😂😂
"where did the bad man touch you?" 
(signals hands)
"LIES!"
This made me laugh so much LOl.
This was hilarious
John is a psychopath.
but I like him
John reminds me of john goodman in  10 cloverfield lane
"Do you like Ned's dog"
"No"
"What!"
"I don't like any dogs"
"Do you like Eugene's dogs?"
"I like Eugene's dogs...."
"god hates liars, and i hate liars" slowly zooms in on face
Okay but lie detectors are only marginally more accurate than a coin flip and lots of courts don't admit polygraph evidence. So this video is more like an elaborate and costly version of an online buzzfeed quiz "These Picture Of Cats Will Tell If You're Lying"
Why did everyone choose Keith 😂
damn! eugene often sounds so depressed and self doubting, i just want to keep him on a blanket and give him tea till he feels better, then send him to therapy. Also i just adore Zach.
I'm supposed to be asleep it's so hard to laugh😂😂😂
This was amazing.
I want John to join at this moment because OMG WHEN HE TURNED AND LOOKED AT NED WHEN HE SAID HIS MARRIAGE IS BETTTER 😂😂😂😂
8:19 I LOVE JOHN HE WINS EVERYTHING
Gah John seems so bored
John is the best try guy
hi is Eugene single
There is no such thing as a lie detector
As time goes on, they just stop trying to lie
the only time john said anything except for "he's lying" or "he's telling the truth" was when ned said he had a better marriage than him and that'd he'd kill him right there. who hurt him?
How can you just not like bean. he's so adorable
I want to know more about Eugene's mums stories
Why......uh.....why does John scare me. .-.
we want part 2
damn John is intense😂
Love how they're all trying to look tough while they're interrogating each other, and Zach's just sucking on a lollipop lol.
"Nobody likes nuns Eugene" 😂
I love Keith too lol
I believe god doesn"t exist...DETECT THAT
ZACH LOOKED SO GOOD WTF
SUGGESTION: have you guys play the board game CLUE like, hand them the cards of who killed who etc and see if you can bypass the polygraph
later after the video john killed ned
I love how the lie detector guy maintains a straight face the whole time
John is a little.... off.
John is the best try guy
do another one !!!! that was interesting
I wanna sign a petition to make John a try guy😂
But you can fake lie detectors by keeping your heart beat low
hahaha.. when John said "I'll kill you right here."  I had to watch that twice it was so funny lol
i laughed so hard every time zach lied about how many co-workers he's made out with
John is my spirit animal 😂🙌🏼
7:14
All that matters
"I'll kill you right here" holy god I love John
Omg John is #DamagedBae
God hates liars and I hate liars 😂😂😂😭
MY FAVORITE VIDEO EVER OMFG KSJSIWKCNVIOSPQPX
Lie Detectors don't even work.
"I don't know those babies."
OKAY EVERYTHING ON EUGENE IS ATTRACTIVE ASF
John must be fun at parties
I think John needs a snicker
The marriage one😂😂😂
Ned 😂😂😂😂
I love the try guys
" everything's a toy if you play with it . "
lord .
i think Zach will find love😙😙😙
I want to know the questions that didn't get the video
John must be a hoot at parties
Omg I loved this so much! lol
That John has no chill
John is super creepy...
eugene is the best try guy
"I don't know those babies" me everyday.
omg zach was so cute in this.. but... he made out with 3 co-workers😂😂😂
Lie detectors don't work the way you want them to work.
Imagine the entertainment/pain of being a telepath? Getting excited about being able to hear peoples' thoughts, and getting hurt to hear what your loved ones think of you if it's bad.
john was the real mvp in this video
JOHN A SAVAGE!!
"So that was great, uhh I like being hooked up to machines" - Eugene
5:56 I'm part Italian!!!!!
Zach: do you think I would be a good husband
Ned:yes 
(sorry I forget his name but here I go) He's lying
Me: Burts out lying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"God Hates Liars And I Hate Liars" He's Lying
You can beat polygraph machines. They record things like heartbeat and if you keep your cool you can beat them, and sometimes they can think you are lying if you are simply nervous
I ship Eugene and Zac so hard
Lying makes you go to hell.
Poor Italian baby boat 😭
Keith saying "we gotta be better about that" made me smile
John should be the next try guy
polygraph is fake
'a boat.. full of newborn italian babies-'
'aww'
'oR! a boat with your wife'
"I'll kill you right here"



"John if you could save your wife, or-or a boat full of orphans, would you? 


"...I'd kill her"
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" 😂😂😂😂
How can Keith not like pillow humping bean??!!!?!!!
Lol John is awesome
John is god.
YOU CAN TELL KEITH REALLY WANTS TO GET FUCKED BY EUGUNE
When Ned kept on talking about John the lie detector dude I thought he was going to be strangled like Homer Simpson strangles Bart.
8:20 I'll kill you right here
Why would John hate lies, without lies John wouldn't have a job
oh my god.
these things are so inaccurate tho
Don't read my name
John is so intense I love it
KEEP JOHN AT ALL DEF DIGITAL SMH
I bet John works at Buzzfeed and they did not even turn on a laptop.
John so scary
best video in awhile
John is so serious during this video
0:30 oh my god
I literally cannot take this test I lie all the time I'm shook
Hahaha "Everything's a toy if you play with it." 
I gotta say tho, out of all the tryguys Keith is my least favourite.
ned is most likely to go on a killing spree from the try guys the darkness in his eye when he says i dont know those babies
These things have proven to be faulty AF but it's still always fun to watch non-criminals take them lol
"God hates liars and I hate liars" lolol
Eugene is the best lololol, his hair is on point as usual~
i'm crying. xD
John hates lieing, I am now a potential contestant to be murdured
This is honestly the only series keeping buzzfeed alive
Keith is NOT the best try guy. Keith is NOT the funniest try guy. and that's the cold hard truth.
Everybody here feeling bad for Eugene while I'm Eugene 😔😂
Polygraphs don't actually work for lie detecting, it just detects heart rate and other stuff like that, but the changes aren't necessarily directly correlated to lying 😒
" I'll kill you right here"
Johns a little snitch. Damn john. come on john.
My favorite try guy is Eugene.
Where did Ned's hairline go?
God hates liars and I hate liars
Polygraphs  are just pseudoscience. Even the inventor hated them
y'all do know how awfully flawed these machines are, right?
"I will kill you right here" 😂
Aaand now I'm shipping Eugene and Zach
John is so emotionless I want a whole series on just him
Eugene looking daddy as usual 💦
John was the best part of this video
I like how Jon is straight faced the entire time 😂😂😂
lie detectors are terrible, they are scientifically proven not to work
even the guy who made them said they shouldnt be used for what they are used for
"Nobody likes nuns Eugene. I grew up catholic" well justified!😂😂😂😂
Ned is my least favorite
John is Terminator
Fine, I'll admit it -- this was actually kinda great, quick and funny. Well done 👏👌🤙
Keith and Grant look so much alike I can't tell them apart sometimes. I was so confused when everyone was calling Grant, Keith. Then I realized it was Keith 😐😂
When Keith says to Ned " I don't need your explanation " I bursted out laughing 😂
Criminals can fake polygraph results if they are really good at it
Lie detectors are actually totally useless and have been proven to be incorrect, if the person who is being "lie detected" can keep a cool head and control their heartbeat they can get away with stuff, but someone who is innocent and is kinda freakin out that they are going to be falsely found guilty, than they can sweat and their heartbeat can speed up and the lie detector can say they are guilty.

That is why it said mr fancy hair was never lying because he kept a cool head and was really just kinda depressing. But he still my favorite, and I'm not trying to hate, I just wanted to write something that someone else besides my  history teacher reads.
"I will kill you right here"  really? You will kill him wow
If you just came from the "try not to rap" video you are out of one in a million
Fucc my stinki pus pus, boaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiii
"I don't know those babies."
bruh Eugene is the Asian verison of josh dun /- l
Did you know?
If you do cardio while taking a lie detector test it would say that you are lieing.

Several serial killers have beaten the lie detector test by staying calm. 

You can take a class to learn how to beat a lie detector.

Fact: 
Lie detectors are old, aweful, and measure, heart rate, blood pressure, sweat, ect. The creator of the polygraph regreted creating the polygraph after seeing what it was used for
These were really interesting questions. Was not expecting them to get that deep. Got shook, fr.
Aw~ all members of Try Guys are awesome. Love them all. ❤️

Aaaw Eugene. Out of all of them, he's definitely the one that's had the rougher life and he's definitely the more closed off one.
"I don't know those babies."
IM SCREAMING
Me watching thus video😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😂😂😂😂
my little heart at the "ugh, we gotta be better with that"
This was so funny I could not help myself.
"god hates liars, and i hate liars"  john is god
Why they got to do each other like that 😂😂
Eugene is smexy af
ned is a bad liar even i can tell he is lying without the machine
JOHN IS MY SPIRIT ANIMAL IM LAUGHING SO HARD AT HIS RESPONSES AT EVERYTHING
John is a robot that occasionally murders people
7:44 Zach and Eugene give me life
Zach a hoe
Who hurt John? x'D
I HATE CATHOLICS
Can Quinta and Eugene have babies pls???? Thanks
Why are all polygraph examiners totally emotionless?
John is practically Scruffy from Futurama.
We want John! We want John!
bcuz Kieth is the funniest
Next Episode: The final episode of the Try Guys
"Do you kill the Italian baby boat Ned?"
-Eugene Lee Yang 2017
"I'll kill you right here." 😅
the try hard guys
I was so hoping that at 9:06 Keith was gonna say Keith.
I love John. 😂😂
I lie it
*like 
😂😆😅
You guys realize lie detectors don't actually work right?
OHHH Keith always wanting to be center of attention
Eugene:"its the one thing people said was attractive when I was young"Me in my head:"That can't be true,and if it is then...WOW,he has improved😍
Can someone make the Try Guys go to a haunted place and do a collab with Unsolved?
I don't like john lmfao
lmao I don't think John enjoyed his part in this
to bad polygraph machines don't actually tell if someone is lying. Even the inventor himself denies its validity!
I never wanted this video to end XD
I don't know those baby's
Polygraph Tests don't work
"I'd Kill her" lmao
Lie detector tests are really simple to fake.
I liked a buzz feed video. Welp. Prepare my funeral.
john, welcome to your tape
wasnt john on ADD
Eugene is so hot...
"I like being hooked up to machines..." -Ugene, 2017
The lie guys take a try detector test
john is my spirit animal.
the asian guy is gay
They are fake
Poor John
I thought this was ganna see the validation of a polygraph test.... cuz I'm pretty sure they are slimy accurate
its been proven by the creator of it that its not meant and cant detect lies its detects the patients pulse etc. sweatiness an extremely nervous liar will be caught and many people have been falsely accused and many murderers have been chill and passed it and later been convicted for their crime...
john is my favorite try guy
Zach x Eugene
Jeez, John.
I want to be a polygraph examiner just to hear the tea🐸🍵
I love this! 🤣
To be fair most of us would lie too if we said we would save the babies over someone we love lol, John is so unimpressed 😂 and lets be honest Eugene is the most attractive but I like Keith more :x lol
Literally I would marry zach wtf he's so adorable
when they asked kieth who his favorite try guy was i exoected him to say himself
"God hates liars, I hate liars." That's a lie, according to the Christian faith, God hates no one :)
kieth is the worst for me
Eugene is the best try guy
""I don't know those babies"" Me as Fk
nuns i always scares me
'I don't know those babies' I died😭😂👋🏽
A moment of appreciation for Eugene in formal clothes
"I kill you right here" John was epic. ... do more with him in it!!!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars. I am God here"
Becky will be so proud, Keith. 😂
Lie detectors have been proven to not work multiple times. Look up the studies
Why didn't they ask if they liked John or not? 😂
MAKE JOHN A TRY GUY HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 😂😂😂
I just realized that the person who sits, whoever it it, must be in casual clothes lol
It's the same lie detector dude from dr Phil and Maury 😂😂
"It's not a toy."
"Well, everything is a toy if you play with itl
Why do most polygraph people look like they hate life
I love Eugene
0:29 "god hates liars so I hate liars" dude every one on earth has at least lied some time in the life so don't say you hate liars because if you did you would be hating your self
More like the lie guys
This made my day
oh here goes buzzfeed again with the gay Asian dudes...
john is everything
man oh man, these are my favourite guys to watch hands down, their buddy relationship with each other is so darn entertaining lol
When zach said do u think I make a good husband he sounded like a different person
That polygraph examiner do not want to be there 😂😂😂
I want a lesson from Keith on self confidence, make that happen Buzzfeed!
John is my favorite xD
I'll kill you right here 😂😂😂
this and the cheap vs expensive things are the only good thing about this channel.
I thought it was college humour thank you to the Asian guy , wrong channel.
Keith is the best try guy
#SavageJohn
Well isn't he a jolly little ray of sunshine
Nxt week: "The Try Guys Try Gay"
Did Eugene even lie once?
"a boat of newborn italian babies"
"aw"
"or a boat with your wife"

IM PISSING
"He's telling the truth"...I hear that when ever I close my eyes
9:49 the shade in Neds eyes
Eugene really got to me in this.
8:22 lol Jon:I'll kill you right now Ned:Would you kill orphans to save your wife? Jon:I'd kill her
Try guys looks like Mormon.
its awesome on the fact that the polygraph guy name is john . Like just john .Such a basic name . But I think Bob would be better .
"god hates liars and i hate liars"*death stare*
Omg. I wanna see what parts they cut out of the video 😂
the try guys ice skate
Try Guys: "If you had to give up friend chicken for the rest of your life in order to marry your fiancee, would you do it?"
Keith: ".. Yeah."
Try Guys: "WOW!!!"

I'm shooook.
"I'll kill you right now"
i unstan keith he said he doesn't like dogs
I know John needs to keep a poker face, but I feel really intimidated by his seriousness.
Ok so eugenes mom needs to talk about her clairvoyant experiences in one of these videos.
Maybe my favourite try guys video
John took the spotlight with 2 sentences
Dang, making out with 3 coworkers!  Way to go Zach!
they are all so goofy and lovable
Is this the same guy All Def Digital used in their lie detector tests?
4:54

Keith: Do you ever wanna f*ck any of us?
Eugene: No
John: He is lying

Brooo Eugene......
guys if you ask asians if they believe in ghosts, it's very likely they'll say yes because asian ghosts are scary as F !!!!
Did John kill him later???
I'm always curious as to how scripted these are. I would absolutely love it if they were all real and raw. Either way, love these guys!
Ned hurt me @6:15
Only series not cancerous on buzzfeed
I think you guys were throwing John off and he just started guessing 😂
Real question: is John lying?
I don't think I've ever seen Eugene laugh so hard before xD But damn, that "do you know how much we care about you?" question was a heart breaker.
"I'll kill you right now" 


John is a character 😂
"I like being hooked up to machines,"
polygraph tests are pseudoscience
John got me weak when he said I'll kill her😂😂 stone cold murder right there
I love Eugene... How could you not pick Eugene?
Eugene is my favorite
lYING MAKES YOU GO TO HELL
Eugene is the best try guy
Some of these answers were absolutely hilarious oml
I never laughed so hard in my life after seeing Ned be so uncomfortable, especially when john said he'd kill ned
We need to start appreciating just how beautiful Eugene is.
Holy ehit that one question
Since when did Zach's libido get this damn high
John's reaction is lit 😂😂😂
hey can people please subscibe to my channel please. i know i shouldnt self promote but its hard for a youtube channel to get start up
man John is a homie
"God hates liars, and I hate liars. Therefore, I am God."
Omg it's Honest John from ADD
Dear man giving test
God hates liars he also hates me you know why, didn't think so I'll tell you. I'm lesbian, I have two children out of wedlock and one not , I hate some very little but some people , and I've lied before also just saying that was just a few reasons 
                                     Sincerely, Angilina Lepree
"Thought you hated little kiddies" lol 😂
Eugene is soooooooooo hot! Marry me!
Killing nuns is fine? Where is the world going... meanwhile you bend over backwards for islam.
sounds like all the other try guys should put their weiners in keith's mouth.
Lmao the lie detector guy is so funny I didn't think he would be like that hahahaha
John is a psychopath
''God hates liars ,and I hate liars'''
-John
Yeah yeah! Child of divorce, whoop whoop! Jk The feels, Eugene. I gottchu. T.T
I think Eugene actually wants zach, as seen from Try Guys Try UFC Fighting, Eugene says "it feel like Zach might squeal like a little piggy, and that really excites me"
John has no emotion
I like John
John:I will kill you 
I died at that moment.
The old guy is so creepy
Keith needs to learn how to tie a tie.
john is my favorite try guy
Welcome to the Jeremy Kyle show...
Polygraphs don't work.........they really don't a plant gave readings in a polygraph, just stay calm and you'll pass
Polygraphs don't work.........they really don't a plant gave readings in a polygraph, just stay calm
No, consulting the town psychic is not weird.  Geez, Keith.  Okay that was great.  Entertaining, personal, awkward, but yet affirming.  Nice job, gentlemen!
Eugene and Zach? I ship it
Polygraphs don't work
the tester is just kinda sad and loves his machine....
John is basically Ron Swanson lol
ZACCCH XD
Three things that never hide forever; the sun, the moon and the truth
I hope I meet someone like eugine
They stole John from ADD!
I can't believe no one in the comments yet has commented about Eugene and wanting babies. I expected there to be millions.
"i dunno those babies" bahahahaa
polygraph tests are pretty inaccurate but this was still a fantastic video; the comedy makes up for bad technology lol
This was by far the funniest episode of The Try Guys ever!
They ask is your life a lie he says no the guy says he is lying
ok but why do they all look so hot in this video jfc
Is Ned okay? He seemed upset, anxious, worried something......... I dunno...just look out for him. I know I have no idea what goes on in Ned's life but he seemed different, not himself. Was he nervous to do the test I case he got a very personal question, something too personal? It looks like he's gone down a dark path at the moment.
I watched this whole thing with the hugest grin on my face. Love these guys haha.
when Eugene said he didn't know how much the other guys cared about him and Keith said "we've got to be better about that" my heart SWELLED
Eugene  is getting  hotter and hotter in each  video his in ,Eugene is really  hot just saying
"Everythings a toy if you play with it." These are the words I live by.
Everything's a toy if you play with it.
I'm going to use this forever lol
John is my spirit animal
This was hilarious
John was kinda scary XD
This just made me love Eugene more lol
The lie detector guy seems like he'd be the killer in a scary movie O_o
"everything's a toy if you play with it" - zach 2k17
John has zero chill.
The sad part is that the lie detector doesn't work
i don't know those babies
the lie detector guy seems really serious
8:10 - 8:40 I'M DYING!
Eugene made me so sad when they asked "do you know how much you mean to us" and he just automatically said no
NED OMG YOU NEED TO STOP TALKING
god hates liars, and I hate liars



But isn't the people who wrote the Bible are also liars and the book itself is also a lie ~_~
damn the guy working the polygraph was not havin it
Zach, I think you're the best try guy ❤️❤️❤️
I am in love with Zach!
wtf John is so scary
this isn't always accurate, because people could just be nervous, lying or not
i loved every moment of this
John should be the new try guy
My parents are single too
He:Ah, finally. I've waited so long!
She:You want me to leave?
He:No! I dare not even think!
She:Do you love me?
He:Of course! Lots!
She:Have you ever cheated?
He:No. Why are you asking me?
She:Will you kiss me?
He:Yes, every time I get the chance!
She:Will you ever hit me?
He:Are you crazy?! No!
She:Darling?
He:Yes?

Now... Read that from bottom to top!
I feel like the rest of the Try Guys have a "Operation Make Eugene Feel Loved"
I loved the "very personal ones" lol!
My jigga John
"i don't know those babies." with a very monotone voice, he said as he decided to kill a boat of italian babies over his wife.
the poligraph is a crazy test that doesn't prove a thing and it's inadmissible in court.
1,355,421 view 😀😀😀😀
DO A PART 2 ON THIS PLEASE !
That guy brought God into it at the start? 
Well, that ruined it for me
The real liar is the one asking the questions
Try guys are the only reason why I'm still subscribed to buzzfeed.
4:33 shoked me  hahaha zach lied😂
0:28 But isn't it a sin to hate?
But lie detectors don't exactly work if you're taking it right after you do sports right? Or if someone is sweaty and nervous?
"god hates liars and i hate liars"
I love all of them!
"I'll kill you right here." LMAO
Gosh, thanks for letting me come long. That was fun.
7:23 awww eugene bbs
I think it says a lot that everyone chose Keith as their favorite of the group. He must be as funny in real life as he is in the videos
Go to 1:41 captions on
john is one of the best things to come from buzzfeed
How do you not like Bean, Keith?!
how yall stealing John from all def digital. lmao.
Zack looks like a baby. That's probably why he's still single cuz usually women prefer strong manly guys u know
Zack: hey Keith do you like Ned's dog
Keith: No
Ned: What
John: Keith is telling the truth
Ned: No
Keith: I don't like any dog
Ned: do you like Eugene's dog 
Keith: I do like Eugene's dog
Ned: Welcome to your tape
ned and ariel are the cutest
OMFG God and John, the same person. America f*ck yeah!!!
John: "I'll kill you right here."
"Would you rather sink a boat full of newborn Italian babies or a boat with Ariel in it?" 
Ned: "I don't know those babies"
The Italian baby boat
Eugene's answers are highkey sad
I thought polygraph only worked best with yes and no answers
Werent these things debunked and known to not actually be able to detect if they are lying?
XD What the Frag?!
"Do you think you have a better marriage than john?"

Ned: yea I guess so he's older and the marriages get to weaken a little 

John: I will kill you right here 

I was dying 😂😂
Zach looks so good in this I mean they all do but like. Zach this is a good look
"god hates liars...and i hate liars."

well...that escalated quickly
This actually is my favourite thing the Try Guys have done!
"not a toy..."
"well, everything is a toy if you play with it..."

OOOOHHH MY GOODDDDD SHOOOTSS FIRE AIRHORNS YOUVE BEN SERVED HOLLY TRUPLE.
In the Try Guys Try Sexy drinks video Eugene said "One Day" in response to Zach having a fuckable body... Next try guy video...
I'm like Eugene, I keep too many secrets.
Is no one talking about the real MVP here, John
A lie detector is fake its rates how neverous you are
yygffftt Uuuuquelash ytgtg
i love how eugene  is so calm 😂
MORE JOHN <3
"I'd kill her..." continues to sit there emotionless
LMAO KEITHS LAST QUESTION BYEE
zack was too sexy in this video, get out
johns enthusiasm makes this video perfect 👌👌
Someone should have asked Eugene if he's gay.
Can we just take a moment for that guy that was saying if it was true not 😇
John seemed excited :')
I'm so happy this is posted on my birthday! 😊💕
''God hates lairs and i hate lairs''
Eugene is my favorite if I'm not lying

Lu is telling the truth
I lie to protect myself
it makes me sad to hear Eugene say he was told he was unattractive..bet those girls are eating their words now cause hes hot.
I loved this lol
John is scary af
That Old Man Is Grumpy. I Don't Like Him.


Fell!Smol Jammy Is Telling The Truth
Oh Eugene
"You psycho don't applaud him!"😂😂😂😂😂
God does not hate lairs God loves all but that does not mean their not doing anything wrong.
Eugene doesnt believe in true love :(
ahhhhh I love Eugene soo much omf
Great video I liked it. :)
if you put it on subtitles every he says keith is lying it shows up key fish line😂😂😂😂
"So apparently I wanna f_ck Zach"


I can hear the fanfictions...

Keith is the best
Check it out, its a database of those leaks and u can search by username https://sites.google.com/site/snapleakswiki/

Have you guys ever heard of them apps that some people use to
This is the most intense try guys video ever
He's telling the truth
Zach is my baby 😍
you can not trust a polygraph
John, looks over "I'll kill you right now." Had me dying.
John is my current mood
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 😂
My favorite episode
if this was a polygraph test you could not trust the polygraph
is lie-detector test fully real? I heard it goes according to your stress level. If its going by stress level i don't think it fully correct
iM CRYIG THIS IS SO FUNNY
i love how ned kept digging a hole deeper and deeper for himself. i literally died 2 times rewatching that LOL then jon freaking dumps his wife for a boat of random babies. how noble
No offense but polygraphs aren't reliable at ALL. But the try guys right? xD
I knew Ned would save his wife....he always talks about her.
im questioning my sexuality now cuz eugenes just so good looking
"I don't know those babies" 
Nedd you scare me :P
omg this has to be number 1 in trending!!
This was genuinely so good
I felt so sad during Eugene's questioning...
John is my favorite try guy
I was ok edge the whole video
Eugene is so depressed but atleast we know he has fun in his job , he has always been my fav from buzzfeed and ,, the hottest 🌚🌚🌚
Lol lie detector test are fake IF YOUR PRESSURED YOUR LYING IF YOUR CHILL YOUR NOT!!!
Oh my jesus....
"Everything's a toy if you play w it"
6:09 in the background
and I hate you John you're a liar polygraph are fake
THIS WAS THE BEST IDEA FOR A TRY GUYS EPISODE EVERVVRERR
"God hates liars,and I hate liars" oh man john, someone must've really hurt you in the past
"god hates liars, and i hate liars" who hurt you john?
Rip their friendship 😂😜
It's not lying if you don't say anything at all. If your boyfriend is cheating on you and I say he's not, it's lying, but if I say nothing, it's not
"God hates liars and I hate liars." Woah shook
"God hates liars and I hate liars."
Dammit Keith! 😂
this moment was majestic 7:40
How does Eugene look so pretty?
all of them look ridiculously attractive on this video. 



that is to say, more so than normal  (somehow)
Why do they all like Keith the best? I find him pretty annoying at times...
more
Eugene the best try guy in my opinion
they make me believe in love some of their questions and answers were so cute
Lie detectors dont work.
"God hates liars..."

Wow... too bad for you sparky that the lie detector can be easily defeated, and was called a Frankenstein monster by its own creator.  It doesn't detect truth... It's old timey pseudoscience
8:19 IM DYIN, why is this me with people I hate
The try guys should try planning a wedding...my mom went through that and it was hell
Eugene is my favorite Try Guy
OMG! I think I'm in love with this video! it was reallly awesome
This is making my anxiety flare up 
UGGGHHHHH It's so hard to watch >_< Believe in me guys!! ;-;
I thought it said "The lie guys"
"...I'd kill her"

JOHN WINS EVERYTHING HE'S SO FUNNY
eugene is my favorite
John sounded so depressed :p
I don't know those babies
Ned: "Keith let's talk about becky" 
keith: instantly smiles 
awwww 😂❤
"i don't know those babies" i can't stop laughing
Eugene wants children?...sign me up.
Keith do you think you better looking than Ned
Keith: yes
operator:he is telling the truth. im not even reading the polygraph
fuckboy zach in the house
part 2 please!
John reminds me of Ron Swanson
John looks so done. Like : "you cannot shock me. I heard all the lies and know all the dark secrets"
im telling the truth
Lie detectors mainly just detect if they have any nervous spikes
So if they r nervous it may be wrong
Lie detectors mainly just detect if they have any nervous spikes
So if they r nervous it may be wrong
Everybody Loves Keith.
I was dying at John! He was so serious 😂😂
I love John.
"I will kill you right now" John is a Savage
Everytime I see Zach I think of a face on his butt.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"... Yeesh that guy is intense!!!
See I'd never be good at this because I get nervous telling the truth and telling a lie
did you know that you can actually beat a lie detector test by being chill 





I aint lying
John is scary
Zach: Well anything you play with is a toy .

hmmm that's deep
Lowkey shipping Eugene and Zach now XD
eugene wanna marry me? k thanks buddo
Ned's a cuck
It is very easy to fake lie detector tests
Do you like neds dog no do you like eugenes dog yes he's telling the truth
Fake lie detector
adam ruins the polygraph college humor. watch it bruh
The dude behind the computer is really creeping me out
Zach: Do you think I'll ever find love?
Keith:Yeah
"He's lying"
If I was a try guy and they said who's you favorite of us I would say "Me"
H E  I S  T E L L I N G  T H E  T R U T H
"I don't know those babies"😂
5:23 All the Zack/ Eugene shippers come out of the woodwork
john scares me
I just choked on my drink thanks buzzfeed...
Aren't lie detectors entirely inaccurate
They should have brainstormed better questions...
lie detectors can be wrong. you can get stressed about some questions even if you are not lying. you can also trick them if you learn to control your stress response. also, if you believe what you're saying is true, even if it isn't, it could show up as truth.
All Ned talks about is his wife
i am so in love with zach is disgusting
Keith: I don't like any dogs
Ned: Do you like Eugene's dog?
Keith: I do like Eugene's dog.
I'm crying my poor baby Eugene
Wenger out
Hey I'll be the new black try guy! Or a polygrapher...
who lied to John man???
Lie detector tests read the change in heart rate when someone is asked a question.I'm assuming they simply skipped showing  us them being asked neutral questions that would serve as a baseline for what their normal heart rate is when asked a question. 

It seemed more like John was observing their change in pitch (if their voices went higher as the lied, etc), especially when it came to them answering questions that weren't yes/no- than actually relying on the lie detector (though it is possible that, like I said, that they didn't show them setting the baseline). 

Either way, the Try Guys were hella' entertaining and it was another great video.
We need more of these videos omg I love them😂❤
I like nuns...TRUTH
Awww 
"Eugene do you want to have children?"
"Yes."
"He's telling the truth." 
I'm like I'll have your children Eugene ❤️😂
WHEN JOHN JUST LOOKED AT NED AND I JUST I CAN'T BREATHE I'M LAUGHING SO HARD LMAOOOOOOOO
the lie detector is really creepy!
Try Guys need their own channel tbh
Is anybody else bothered by the fact that the polygraph has proven notoriously unreliable in the past?
😂🤣😂🤣
i swear i think eugene could get away with everything because he's so good at being truthful i don't know.
"I'll kill you right here." I died. My funeral is tomorrow.
Why is the lie detector guy so serious omg
LYING MAKES YOU GO TO HELL!
Eugene is very attractive😞
Johns my spirt animal
"i dont know those babies"
I feel bad for laughing when Ned said he'd kill the babies and his reason was "I don't know those babies"
Such beta cucks
Soooo zach made out with all the try guys and no one caught that😳👀...
Try Guys
psshhhhh
More like... Lie Guys
amiright! No... Oh, okay
Eugene I'm willing to have children with you
The lie detector is probably fake anyway, if someone was super nervous, sweaty, fast heart beart, and said that 2+2 is true, the detector would probably show a lie.
John is a savage lol
The guy doing the test is like: god hates liars and I hate liars
Guy doing tests: is god real
Guy: no
Guy doing tests: looks at polygraph that says he isn't lying he's lying!
Guy: he's lying
#fuckedbyyourownshit
Lie detector tests do not work. I thought everybody knows that !
Im pretty sure thats john from add channel 😂😂
That guy is grumpyyyyyyy
Eugene's face after the kids question 👍👌✔
Oh poor John I feel bad for him :)
John is so serious geez
Keith: "Bob can I have four."
He's name is John 😂
You could take a gallon of water that John's wife is drowning in by just posting this hashtag on your twitter and spreading and sharing it.
       
      Post #savejohnswife now
Lie detectors do not detect lies. They are useful as tools to extract confessions, and that's about it.
Of course there needs to be a black try guy!
😂69k
"Keith do you like Ned's dog?" I understood Ned Stark
WE NEED TO KNOW EUGENE'S SECRETS !!😂😂
I've never laughed so much, "I'll kill you right here."
That's it john is the new try guy
I always wanted to do this with my soon to be ex wife.
this is sooooo funny..😂
MORE OF THIS PLEASE!!!
DO THIS AGGGGAAAAIIIINNNNN!!!!!!!!!
You guys should go watch my YouTube videos I post daily and u won't regret it I posted a challenge just now go watch ili🤗
Why is john so solemn
should of asked if he loves his wife
"I don't know those babies" -Ned😂😂
Keith is me honestly
I like John 😂
John is intense
lie detectors don't work
Zach x Eugene boiz
"I don't know those babies"
I love John he's on All Def Digital too 😂
Ah, the good ol' polygraph. So unreliable, even the inventor of it said it's garbage.
Annnnnd now I ship Zack and Eugene
They should've asked Eugene if he head a crush... maybe on a person named Quinta😘😏
god hates liers and i hate liers... jesus that dude is dark af
Keith is the funniest
"That was great, I like being hooked up to machines"

Please, tell me more, Eugene...
It sucks that polygraphs don't actually work, or else this video would be cool
So the truth is that Zach is the F*ckboy of Buzzfeed??? 😂😂😂
This was so interesting to watch!
Zack, you're not single, silly, you're my boyfriend
What post-war is Eugene talking about in Korea?? Didn't the two sides split in like 1950.
Eugene doesn't get enough credit. Truly appreciate his work.
lie detecters are fake right
"I don't know those babies."
lie detecters are fake...or are they
lie detecters are fake...or are they
I don't think Eugene is actually sexually attracted to any of the try guys. Just had a sex dream after eating too much. We've all had them.  :S
Im pretty sure i would fail any lie detector test because of how nervous i would be
THEY SHOULD OF ASKED IF HE EVER CHEATED ON HIS WIFE😂😂😂
It's a polygraph not a lie detector. Polygraphs are ineffective pieces of junk that are easily tricked.
ok sorry but I have to say it: Zac looked pretty hot in this video
Eugene and Keith r tied for the best try guy
They look like characters from Mass Effect: Andromeda.
John seems like a lovely man
Gay cunts I'm black so you can't say any thing
He is a terrifying man.
This is so funny
This was so intense
I think John is kinda satanic or apart of the Westboro Baptist chruch
This was so intense
that dog part was too much
This guy is so done with life omg :D
This was really interesting!
Im a simple gal with simple interests, I see the try guys, I hit like
johns scary
Zach: Do you want to have kids?
Eugene: Yes
Me: I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE 😂❤
My main thought when clicking to watch this was they're going to ask Ned about his wife and I need to know if he's lying.
'I don't know those babies.'
~Ned justifying killing babies and my yearbook quote
Keith is such a G he told the truth throughout like all of it
KEITH
The Best TryGuy
Them: "Which one of us is your favorite"
Me: "... John"
I ship Zach and Eugene... who's with me?
OHHHH SNAAAPPP
Oooo
Also I want to be hooked up to a lie detector and see how good or bad I am xp
"God hates liars and I hate liars." Alright dude XD
😂😂😂😂😂
Try guys  you're going down especially Ned John says he'll kill you right here don't kill the most attractive guys on YouTube that make me laugh John please don't 😧😂😂😂😂🤗😍😘😋😉😊😜😝😛😀😄
Poor John
"I don't know those babies."
Can we get a movie version of this
When you watch this video and see jhons face it like this the  hole time😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
The Try Guys try suicide
Eugene is so handsome and truely amazing I wish he knew this 😭
If Eugene met me then he would believe in true love lmfao
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SHIPS EUGENE WITH ZACH
Why try guys why?! I'm sitting here with my face mask on, trying to get my beauty on, trying to keep from laughing...but u just had to be so damn funny😡🤦‍♀️😩 I can feeel it cracking as I'm cracking up. Not cool guys, not cool. 

Ps. I love u anyway. Especially u Eugene. If I lived in the US I'd probably stalk u to death ❤️xoxo
Why the hell does Eugene have Tom Riddle's hair cut?
I see John switched from ADD to Buzzfeed
When john was saying "god hates liars" I thought he was gonna say "god hates liars and I hate god"
...😅
"I'd kill her" 😂😂my gave try guy
Really wish I had one of those things, I hardly ever know if I'm lying or not >_>

Edit: I mean, I could be lying right now, I don't know!
eugene doesn't believe in true love because his parents are divorced? I think that's just how it is with all of us kids with separate perents
I SHIP EUGENE AND ZACH TOGETHER FROM THE VERY FISRT TRY GUYS EPISODE MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"I like being hooked up with a machine"
The best video I have ever watched
0:28 you're obviously lying john because god isn't real ;)
The divorce part hit home. It truly does mess with your head!
I LOVED THIS VIDEO LMAO <3 :)
I loved this and Keith is also my favourite try guy
Lying makes you go to hell
It's a terrible detection of lying and has been proven wrong many a time in the future
that was amazing
Best video in a long time buzzfeed
John is high key the only person i have ever seen doing lie detector test.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars" omg ok
Is that AllDefDigitals polygraph guy?
"I like being hooked up to machines"        - Eugene2017😂😂👌
I like John. He's cool.
I want to be one of the try guys
"I don't know those babies." 
Mood
It's because Ned and Keith are dominant and they think they are the best
John seems a bit...scary as in like he could kill with the right motive
"God hates liers and I hate liers" so john is god
"I don't know any of those babies"
"God hate liers And i hate liers to!" 

John is god
I had a dream yesterday.the try guys were in it for entertaining purposes (nth dirty ;)   ) ,and I was pointing at Eugene sayin he's my fav .,well better than the supernatural and complicated stuff I usually dream of .
When Eugene went, it just got darker a little bit...
Actually, polygraphs aren't reliable lie detectors
John is the legend27
That John dude makes me crack up
Best episode ever. John is hot.
They copied the ADD channel
It's a nervous detector. But it's damn good fun when it's not serious.
I love these longer videos
funniest try guys video
Pollygraphs are fake.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars'... dayyyyum! I'd like to hook every one of my ex boyfriends up to your lie machine, is there an auto-kill electrocution option attached to it?
john seemed so grumpy.



"hes telling the truth."
0:28 "God hates liars and I hate liars" therefore John is God
john is awsome
john is literally me😂💀
So what about one for the females? To bad can't with certain females because there gone.😐
I love this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He sounds internally depressed....(the guy who said he is lying)
Lie detectors are 100% accurate. There's no reason for a suspect to feel anxious even when they're innocent when they're hooked up to a machine that measures their blood pressure and generally are used in situations where is quite extreme where they need to find a culprit for a crime, etc. So do be nervous, because if you do, you'll likely face some jail time or worse, no pressure or anything.
9998,385th viewer arty over hhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeerrrrrreeeeeeeeee wwoooooooooooooooooooohhhhooooo!
I love John oh my god
LMAO Zach's laugh at 1:09. He sounds like a little school girl.
When you start to notice all of the touching between Zach and Eugene.
Ned looks like a dad lol
I'm Jon
I'm not a gangster, fool
Cause I follow all the rules
I play ping pong and pool

I don't disrespect authority
Or go against majority
Let's face it
My momma is my number one priority

I like Sarah Palin
There's no chicks that I'm nailing
And you'll never catch me failing
Cause I'm sailing through school

I'm white
I'm really, really white
I'm so pale I practically get sunburnt at night

Hey, where you at?
Put your hands in the air
I got a big black comb for my white boy hair

So don't expect me to be nice
I spread like lice
I'm colder than cold
I froze Vanilla Ice

My name is Paint
The lyrical saint
I got too many girls, I wanna file a complaint

I'm 19, although I look like I'm 9
But I pick my women like fruit off the vine
I make guys jealous, and I make girls squeal
That's a lie, I got no sex appeal

So I don't care if you hate me
Girls already don't date me
So go click SUBSCRIBE and don't forget to rate me
Eugene/Zach slash fanfiction. Somebody write it and link me.
Buzzfeed is litterally nothing without the try guys, who agrees?
Buzzfeed sucks
you forgot to censor the f word in there
John is the best 😂😂😂
Thats the same guy that does alldefditigal lie detectors
lmao, John is awesome. "..................I'll kill her"
Part 2!
Omg John is cheating of AllDefDigital with Buzzfeed
my name is john
Who's interested to see them put their "plus size" co workers in front of them and see their true thoughts on the way they look or are they just told to say it? It'd also be interesting if they test they guys beliefs in "white privilege", and "minority oppression". I'd love to see if they really think these things or if it's just show for Buzzfeed.
Eugene doesn't believe in true love but he believes in ghosts...
Eugene and Zack ok
when you've always been shipping Zach and Eugene :^)
Anyone else thought John is like Ron Swanson???
"I don't know those babies" LMAO
It's already been proven that lie detector tests don't really work.
Lie detectors don't work.
Eugene is the guy you'd read about in most high school romance books on Wattpad
Step 1- kiss the palm of your hand. 
Step 2- say your crushes name. 
Step 3- close your hand. 
Step 4- say a week day. (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday....etc)
Step 5- say your name. 
Step 6- open your hand.
Step 7- repost this 6 times.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars."
Uhm, excuse me, r u God?
when lie detecters dont work but you need the money
Ned-"I don't know these babies."
am I the only one who thinks John is actually Ron Swanson
"I don't know those babies"
Damn.. John is depressing lmao
"And I hate liars."
He must have hated everybody in this world...
can John be a try guy?
💕Awwww, Eugene! Let's be insecure together!💕
the look john gave him
i am john
God doesnt hate liers he hates sins
This is the best video I've ever seen
I'd give $10,000 for that lie detector thing
Lie detectors are ineffective and a waste of money.
lie detectors don't even work though
Plz make the try guys play ouija board or how it's spelled
god doesn't hate liars he just is upset
"Everything is a toy if you play with it"
If it asked me if I was gay I would be fucked
I WILL BE YOUR WIFE AND SEX LADY EUGENEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
wow, john seems so... excited...
Eugene asking Keith about fitting penises in his mouth 😂 i love that they don't have any filter
Eugene asking Keith about fitting penises in his mouth 😂 i love that they don't have any filter
We need more john.
'I LIKE BEING HOOKED UP TO MACHINES'
"I lie, I lie A LOT, but if you ask me a direct question, I'll give you a direct answer." is Zach a Sagittarius/Leo? 💀
Sure lie detectors are fake but that guy doing the test is amazing
John looks so done.
why are questions soo gay
GOD HATES LIARS AND I HATE LIARS
I think John must be the father of the 3 boys on Mean Girls 😂
Is John the only polygraph examiner ever? He's in every polygraph video ever
Isn't this the same guy from ADD
Poor John 😞 💔 😭
4:20 and Mex people
Did you know the polygraph doesnt actually work they are just used to intimidate p oeople into telling  the truth
Zach: Do you think I'm ever gonna find love?
Keith: ...Yeah...
John: Keith is lying 

LMAO😂😂😂😂
People do know that polygraphs don't actually work right?
Ned doesn't even need a lie detector, he sucks at lying
if you believe in mythical things what's stopping you from believing in true love
John is so creepy...I love it!
"A lot of women died so we had to use the physic"
"God hate liars and I hate liars" Are you implying that you are god John???
this is the best omg
Lie detectors aren't actually incredibly scientifically based.  They fail a lot.
Can John be a permanent addition???
I vote to add John to the Try Guys.
"I like being hooked on machines" LOL
OMG!!!! MY HEART FLUTTERED THE MOMENT THEY ASK EUGENE IF HE WANTED CHILDREN!!!!!!!
poor john
God does not hate liars. God loves us for who we are.
so everybody loves Keith and Keith loves Zach?
Swear I need to hire John... he is a Polygraph Examiner Celebrity.
The Try guys are average but the best try guy by far is John
This was heart breaking 💔 😭
HOLYSHIIIIIET
"God hates liars and I hate liars" is John implying he's god?
John should be apart of the try guys
I loved this 😂😂
I resonate with Eugene.
these guys are weird lol.
Eugene doesn't believe in true love. High five!
That man carrying out the test is serious 😂
John turned out to be funnier than I thought.
basicly today we learned that the tryguys are all gay(actually no that was pretty obvious, but we learned they had sex 
 between eachother)
John was taking no crap today
where did you find the guy... he is hilarious. i would love to see him in some other videos
This is a great vide * Adam comes out of nowhere * Well........
I kept hearing "keef" whenever they tried saying keiths name lol
Go to 8:20 it's the best thing ever
Zach don't belive him!!! You going to find love!!!!!
cockdick
0:30 ugh I can't escape them
john is so great what is his ig "I'd kill my wife" "I'll kill you right here" "God hates liers and I hate liers"
polygraph tests are very inaccurate
What is 1+1? "2" LIE
LOL whatch Adam ruins everything on polygraph
#JohnForFifthTryGuy2k17
John is god🙏🏻🙏🏻
-_- he is telling the truth...
"We should have a black member"............ Trump 2017
Am I the only one who would love to see some try guys comments reaction or smth like that?😣
I like John
"God hated liars, I hate liars" *alarm goes off for lying*
"God hates liars and I hate liars" John is god
lie detectors are so ineffective, but SO fun
The polygraph guy has the best pokerface ever
"I don't know those babies."😂
favorite episode ever
What about Adam ruins everything about the polygraph tests?
Zaaach 😍😍😊😍😍
are they all gay?
They all look so hot in those shirts and ties omg 😂
what's up with buzzfeed and lie detector tests?
John should be a try guy
John is the best Try Guy
ive always lo-key shipped Zach and Eugene but now im SHIPPING
😂😂😂😂 No one rates Zach
Eugene you break and swell my heart 💔❤️
I didn't expect Eugene to be so insecure about his appearance. And that only his hair made him feel like he was just enough. I think he is a good looking guy, and pretty cute. He is 15 years older than me, almost twice my age (I'm 16) but I am entitled to have an opinion right? 😂😂
I hate people who lied if they liked this vid because of some reason.... like if u agree
All Def Digital..........
This is a pretty funny episode but it might as well just be like 'never have I ever' because it's not like polygraphs actually work.
Eugene trying to hide his laughs is the cutest thing in the world
I'll kill you right there
There is no god, it's nothing but a big lie, it's 21th century old man, keep up already
Zach and Eugene are the cutest thing
"I don't know those babies"😂😂😂
John seems like he's seen some stuff.
THE MAN CREEPS ME OUT HELLPPPPPP
0:27 but god isn't real.
"i dont know those babies"
idk those babies- Ned
"I'll kill u right now" 
LMAO😂😂
polygraph dosnt work
jon has no emotion
I wanna marry Zach 😁❤
I Love Eugene. 💙💚💛💜
Damn... John will be the new Lie Detector killer 😂also such a savage
MORE OF JOHN
I love John
you guys know this is a joke and lie detectors literally have been proven useless like 30 years ago or something
I feel like they should get their own channel! Like ladylike! Just me?
BRUH the lie detectors are not detecting lies. There detecting how nervous and there heart beat and that is what it is detecting. I'm sorry but it's not real people.
Honestly lie detectors are all frauds in a way. Lies are too complicated for a little machine to read accurately. I would be read as lying half the time because I'm nervous and anxious af even when telling the truth
John wouldn't  like me cuz I lie a lot for the good
Why does Zach have a lollipop 🍭
this is one of the best videos i've ever seen 😂😂
I ship Eugene with Zach
Zach has totally made out with Kelsey, I'm calling it now.
... Keith is my favorite, too.
The people controlling those things are always dicks😂
Easy way to beat the polygraph test is to completely ignore the questions and make up your own questions and so the answers would seem random and inconsistent.
That guy is creepy this tech is not out yet
"Well everything's a toy when you play with it." Zach get a girlfriend 😂 actually don't, well maybe..
johns death threats.... he has serious problems i dont think he is even joking - since he said he hates liars .....i think he looks like a depressed peedo
THIS WAS SO FKN COOOL
3:44 
eugene: yup... does some stuff to ur brain guys. 

well... he ain't wrong
noooo the Italian babies :'D
I clicked of the video as soon as he said "god hates liars"
This was awesome 😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is literally the best Try Guys video. I was dying
Love that they were carrying coffee. So funny!
Why are Ned, Eugene, and Zach dressed like extras from the Book Of Mormon?
Euzach... Zene... Zeuch... Zagene... It's hard to find a ship name
Either John is really funny or really dangerous.
aren't polygraphs unreliable alotta times, people being nervous can also cause the machine to think the person's lying..?
DAMN ZACK!!!! THREE!?!?!?!?!
An actually good buzzfeed video
#JohnAsANewTryGuy
Who else thinks John should join the try guys?
"nobody likes nuns" especially if you went to catholic school that allows corporal punishment. They old but they strong.
Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off
Ned was definitely offended when Eugene was asked the divorce question...
I LOVE JOHN
the beard guy is super serious
I am so tired of Eugene's sob story what an asian baby!
John may kill Ned.
This lie detector man needs to have some humor and smile god damn
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" that's why Zach is single 😂😂😂😭😭
Eugene is the most honest but he had some honestys that were kinda sad because like the one where he doesn't believe in true love that is sad 😪😢😥
well, Keith is funnier than all 3 of them combined, so... he's not wrong there
"I don't know those babies."
do u think that is weird?

no 

hes telling the truth

WELL it is!
I would really like if the Try Guys put like 1 hour video ! I won't mind , i never get enough of them
AMAZING 10/10 AWESOME THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES
0:28 'God hates liars and I hate liars,' does that mean he is God? O_O
Yo if you need a black Try Guy just tell me where to send my resume.
ASAINs want so many grand children and Mexicans I'm ASAIN and my parents have 6 kids including me
john gives me the creeps
"I don't know those babies!!"
I understood "Ned Stark" instead of "Ned's Dog" and was a bit confused why this would be considered a very personal question
0:30 JOHN HAS SPOKEN
ngl I would watch a sequel this was the best try guys video I've seen
Damn Zach was looking good in that shirt and tie!!🙌
When Ned said, "I don't know those babies" 😂
Polygraphs aren't aways correct when you are nervous afraid mad or sexually aroused it shows a spike in the polygraph
8:15 to 8:35 just 😂
This confirms the Eugene-Zach ship.
john seems sketchy
....
These guys are adorable hhhhhhh
Their laugh!
The moment the guys where like WOWOWOWOW when Keith gave up his fried chicken for his wife
( 8:19 )
John: I will kill you right here 
Ned. :would you rather save    
           your wife or a boat full
           of orphans 
Jhon:...I'd kill her
Me😂😂😂😂😂
Zach at 1:10 with a lollipop and giggling 😹😹
JOHN IS A SAVAGE
Ariel is bae💙
EUGENE I love you!!!!! You're the best try guy
john looks like he his hating ever moment.
Can John please join the try guys? 😂😂
Polygraphs are pseudoscience
ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING-forensic science
John made me laugh so hard!
7:05 Ned or Will Arnett?
That man john is my hero.
Lie Detector Tests are pure bunk. With enough will, you can easily fool a lie detector test.

Go watch Adam Ruins Everything about Forensic Science.
Polygraphs have been proven to be incredibly inaccurate for lie detecting. There a bunch of factors that would effect polygraphs such as nervousness. Even myth busters talked about this
Eugene is the best Try Guy
why is Zach sucking on a damn lollipop? :)
Keith jajajajaj secos que buenas preguntas, cuanta sinceridad en un video xD
Haha
Add John to the try guys XD
Lie detectors are inacurate
Amazing
Polygraph tests aren't always accurate
MA BOI JOHN'S BACK AT IT AGAIN 😂😂
he's like the guy from 12 Cloverfield Lane
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 
Are you God?
I think Keith is the best as well....
"Aww" to "I don't know those babies" in seconds Hahahhaa
John is my spirit animal. He also reminds me of Ron Swanson from Parks and Rec
the lie detectos is pretty useless, you will find out
John is my spirit animal
i remember watching thisba year ago... dafuq?
Everything is a toy if you play with it.
trash "science"
Johns a savage MothaFucka Jesus Christ 😂😂😂
Zach: "Will I ever find love?"
Keith: "Yeah!"
Lie detector dude: "He's lying"
Me: bursts out laughing
But seriously: is John a robot?
Lol I love John
John be so damn serious!
Is your hair the product of all your insecurities?
LOL
That was funny 😂 lol
John = god.
That's the same guy from All Def digital!
I have such a huge crush on Zach <3
I don't think anyone could not like Keith.
Poor Eugene. One day Eugene will be in love and be so protective like Ned. Gosh dang it Eugene is hot because he's the one who hates everything and is the mysterious one. I just love them all though
This video is so funny XD
lmao john is amazing
The sweat detector i call it.
you should do a part 2!!
Man turns his head slowly "I'll kill you right there" death glare
they shoulda done this when they tasted trumps food 😏
eugene loves bieng hooked up to machines cause he doesent get a realy machine
Its sooo creepy how he says "hes telling the truth" or "hes lying"
lie detectors don't actually work
Dont Read My Profile Pic ;) Seriously Don't!
that guy running  the test was an add
you know Ned's wife giving him a good time tonight after those answers
Lie detectors don't even work... :D
Buzzfeed still trying to ruin relationships 😂
7:14 THAT IS BRUTAL! Damn Keith...
John's definitely the best try guy lmao😂
That dude John (the polygraph examiner) may hate liars, but God doesn't. God loves everyone! He just deeply hates sin, and lying is a sin... Just saying
Lie detectors aren't accurate 

Go watch Adam ruins everything
John to be a new try guy petition?
Can't wait until there's gonna be little Eugenes running around with great hair
O hhhhhhahajssks
This is not a valuable source of information even the inventor of the lie detector said he regrets making that contraption. Plus humans are way more complicated than that! What the lie detector does is it looks at blood pressure,sweat, heart rate, etc etc but people could just be nervous of the results and just be a guy who came back from working out. There are killers in the past who have been tested and succeeded on not getting caught.
Polygraph tests are not accurate.
I love this one
I love this. they HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN!
can i just hug eugene tho like this killed me
Why did they act so surprised when they if Keith would give up fried chicken for the love of his life?
Eugene is by far the best try guy....imo
H e ' s     l y i n g
and then they broke up after this
This was the most entertaining video I've seen in a while
isn't John the dude from ADD?
its robtop
6:48 Eugine you're attractive! Even without the hair you'd be attractive! He has charisma and a nice face structure, eyes and basically everything.
That John guy really scares me ...I really hope he is joking.
eugene pls make a child of divorce video!!!!
do people know that lie detectors don't even work?
i dont believe in this lie detector thing
I don't know if I love John or if I'm absolutely terrified of him...😂
God doesn't hate liars. God doesn't hate anyone.
It's not a toy? Then why are you doing this video?
John is soooo creepy its funny
Isn't that John from ADD's "Pretty Girls Are Shallow?" Video?
If you hate liars, why are you administering polygraphs? They're not a lie detecting device, liar.
John: God hates liars 
Me: I'm sorry I thought God loved everyone 
Also me: religion is fucked
I need one of these... I can't believe people
"I'll kill you right here"
lmao!!
I'd fail a lie test any day, I'd get nervous and nobody would believe me
I LOST IT AT 7:35, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S FACE TO LOOK AT
John is done with all of them
Except that polygraph tests don't work if you are calm
the lie detector dude's voice is perfect for this
Eugene..I feel for you
surprised there wasn't more sexual questions😂
Eugène is sexy
I love john lmao
Put John in more of your videos PLEASE.
Yeah TTG are back! Miss them on Buzzfeed
Zach's chest hair is so much its even on my screen.
I feel like you learn a lot from this :D
I love Eugene and his insecurities. Is that weird? proabably. oh well.
this is by far the best video of the try guys. absolutely my fav! 😍
"Every things a toy if you play with it"- Zack 18+
Zack baby boy u playa
"God hates liars and I hate liars."

That guy puts the fear into me
"I'd killer her"
Everyone loves Keith 😂
god hates liars and i hate liars
was this kinda sad to anyone?
I wanna do this with my friends lol
"everything's a toy when you play with it" my favorite line XD
haha this is the same lie detector guy from ADD!
I liked this video before it started Wtf
this was hilarious "I'll kill you right here" 😂😋😂😋
Zach is a player omfg. Honestly though I would date him on a heartbeat i love him. And I weirdly love his friendship with Eugene tbh
Eugene was the most honest one there
But the lie detector doesn't  work.
I need them to re-visit the lie detector monthly. This was great.
Ok but lie detector tests aren't accurate
ADD John?
When lie detectors are fake any ways
He's telling the truth.
Did I actually just see a gun rights ad on a buzzfeed video?
7:13 your welcome
Make john one of the try guys
"Everything is a toy if you play with it"
John scares me.
I was hoping Keith would say himself as his favorite
I'll have Keith's children.
John is a very interesting character I'd love to see a cartoon with a guy like him
god this guy is so mean ahaha
Search up John he isn't a real polygrapher lol
who else felt emotional or almost cry ......or..
Thank you for doing try guy videos that aren't squad wars :)
ZACH YOU PLAYER YOU
Polygraph tests are only correct about 50% of the time and are not admissible in court.
The polygraph is doesn't actually work. A lie that supposedly detects lies.
The 700 dislikes are nuns
"I'd kill her" bruh had me in tears 😂
"God hates liars and I hate liars" 

I love that guy!!!
"Eugene, Do you believe in true love?"

"No"

Clearly because you have never met me
You Can Bypass a Lie Detector
I LOVE THIS!!!!!!! CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!!!
keith:is your hair the product of all your insecurities?
eugene:yes 
john:he's telling the truth 
eugene:it was the one thing people said was attractive 
me:eugene needs a hug bring back the hugging bear
oh my god John is so intense
Do you think I would make a good husband? 

-Eugene in the background
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The lie detecter guy was so creepy and weird!
Zach: We should have a black member right?
Eugene: Of course 

😂😂😂😂😂
Ned soooo loves his wife ... 😻
That was fun to watch:)
Eugene x Zachary
I wonder if Eugene is one of the co-workers that Zach has made out with ;)))
I believe John is the Machine and not the Lie detector itself
😂 polygraphs are easy to beat.
John needs to become a permanent part of Try Guys!
When in the Bible did it ever say god hates liars god loves everyone
keef ez teleng the trufth
3 COWORKERS ZACH?!? 3 F ING COWORKERS?!? NOOOO :'( That should've been me :'(
I fully expected Keith to say his favorite try guy was himself
Lie detectors are wrong as hell. The guy who created them said it was like Frankenstein's monster. Watch the Adam ruins everything episode.
" God hate's liars and I hate liars." Dude I swear he sounds like a serial killer.
John is a savage!
the change in zach's face when he was asked if he thought he was the best...was kinda heartbreaking
god hates liars.
Zach you can marry me.
GUYS STOP MAKING EUGENE THINK ABOUT HIS INSECURITIES
John is my Spirit animal
Marriage doesn't go bad with time when you take your time finding the right person . Don't get married before knowing yourself !
L Y I N G   M A K E S   Y O U   G O   T O  H E L L
Who tf hurt John?
God hates liars, I hate liars 
Therefore, I am God
I loved what John said!!!!! I'll kill you right here!!!! It's not a toy!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can John be the newest Try Guy?
ohhhhhhhh god! this is cool
god hates liars and i hate liars hahahahahahahahahahahaha
from 7:45 to 8:37 was the best part
"God hates liars and I hate liars"
"Everything is a toy if you play with it"
"I don't know those babies." Good explanation.
That's my dad yo
its the guy from def digital
The guy reading it sounds so depressed!!
favorite try guys vid
Except a polygraph is a lie itself. A polygraph reads blood, heart rate, and sweat. The only thing you have to do to trick a polygraph is be completely calm. There are schools that teach people how to trick people.
EUGENE HAS A DOG. THATS IT! HE IS THE PERFECT GUY
Is this john from all def digital? 😂
"Do you believe that Buzzfeed is overrated and you're only a part of it so you can eat expensive food?"
"...No."
"He's lying..."
Pleaseee do another one!! We want more secrets😂😂😂
John needs to be a new try guy
This is not how a poligraf works...
it sounds like if he catches you lying he will kill you 
no offense
Zach: Eugene do you know how much the three of us care about you?

Eugene: No

Keith: Damnit we gotta be better at that

Aawwwwww
ADD
god doesn't exist so he can't hate lairs
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." -  Zach Kornfeld, 2017.
We all know that these tests are totally faulty and have led to hundreds of false convictions right? Okay? Alright, got it, I'll show myself out 😬
John is the real mvp
I was literally laughing the whole time 😂😂😂
Eugene broke my heart. We all love you Eugene and think you're the best Try Guy.
I cried when Eugene said he didn't know how much he meant to all of them
I'd kill her lmao
Omg john in the beginning I couldn't stop laughing 😂
minute 4:57, the beginning of my OTP
I LOVE JOHN "ILL KILL YOU RIGHT HERE" IM CRYING
I love John!!
eugin so hot and super cool ...✌
Polygraph Examiner said "God hates liars and I hate liars." Well, moron God is the biggest lie of them all and you fell for it moron. Organized religion was built on one big lie to control the masses.
I'm a pathological liar I literally will tell a lie and even tho it's a lie my brain will actually belive that my lie is the truth.
Something about Ned just severely annoyed me
This had me dying
how was eugenes hair the only thing that was attractive when he was young? i find that very hard to believe
John is my spirit animal
Why do they change clothes when they go to the lie thing
I love this so much 💚
Kieth is my favorite try guy too!! and Eugene is gorgeous!!
So this is what Ron Swanson did after Parks and Rec.
John is a savage 😂😂😂😂😂
is it just me or Ned & Eugene are looking super HOT!!!
Try guys train like superheros?? Plzzzz
"I've tested over 8000 people" .... lie detector explodes
"A lot of woman died of disease, so we had to use the town psychic".
Not a line you hear,ever!!!!
"Well, everything's a toy if you play with it"
New life motto
Someone save me look at Ned in that shirt
Lie detectors don't work
lol I understood "Do you like Ned Stark" when he asked "do you like ned's dog"
I'm scared of john
John seems like he wants to kill himself like if u agree
please repeat this with other peoples
John looks like he's been doomsday prepping for the zombie apocalypse for decades.
wasn't surprised Keith has wondered about fitting penises in his mouth
i don't believe in love too
THIS IS SUCH A GOOD VIDEO
Eugene: I like being hooked up to machines
Me:
Me: Oh
if only i used this on Light....
Keith is everyone's favourite !
Damn Eugene's questions XD
I just noticed that they had to change from their casual clothes to their interrogation clothes for each person 😂
John is my new favorite person of all time
That monitor guy needs mental support... get rid of him.
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"
So due to the transitive property, I am God
The examiner reeeeeeeeally hates his life
bro, john tho.
I feel the same way as Eugene, 
as my parents have been divorced since I was three, and most other members of my family are divorced, I can't see how ANY couple could ever last a lifetime?
And this video was awesome!
0:30 oh boi
I was waiting for him to countinue like "God hates liars, and I hate liars. I am god.
Omg john 😂
yeeeaaah i'm gunna need a part 2 in the future please
this brought me joy
'So, that was great.. I like being hooked up to machines'
The polygraph test doesn't work, it just monitors whether you are nervous haha
I'd date Zach
Me: I'm always lying about something, only small things of course, but still. 

akward pause

Me: I feel kinda bad now that I think about it.

John: She's lying

Me: DAMNIT JOHN
I WILL MARRY ZACH (please?)
This video gave me anxiety
" I don't know those babies " 😂😂😂😂
"everything is a toy if you play with it" They sure like their toys
Keith should have just named himself when asked who is his favourite
Omg they all like Keith the most! :O
The sexual things are untrue
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" very true Zack😚😬
Way to find the creepiest polygraph tester
Eugene is looking all secretive and fuckboy-ish when sitting in the chair
this is boring
lol God doesn't hate anyone... i'll probably get hate for this but people should respect ALL religions.
I wish they asked Eugene is he was gay, and then he'd say yes and I'd be a happy man
I Ship Eugene And Keith😂
Lie detectors are a complete scam, in fact all they do is just simply messure your heart rate blood flow and how much your sweating
I LIKE this video very much!!!! do more of these
"It's not a toy....." You hooked the Try Guys up to it, that automatically makes it a toy.. :P They are man-babies! XD And that's what I love about the show.. :3
0:28 Creep Alert! ... lie detector tests shouldn't even be permissible in court, they're so unreliable... and John almost certainly lies- every single human lies.
I don't know why but I saw polygraphic as pornographic
John is not messing around.
too bad lie detectors dont work
Everything's a toy if you play with it
It's weird how John calls everyone "he" except for Keith.
I'm laughing so hard!!!!! He said "I don't know those babies" 🤣😂
Why does Eugene remind me of an Asian Josh Dun?
EUGENE WANTS KIDS <3
These are the kind of Try Guys episodes I've missed
John should have said,"God hates liars, and i hate liars. Therefore, i am God"
That old man just seems super unfun annoying and grumpy.
L y i n g m a k e s y o u g o t o h e l l
I loved this. ... how long til 200 video? xD
Pauze the video at 1:08 and look at Zach
ngakak so harrdddddd 😂😂😂
John sounds like a robot.....
Eugene is so Asian. Like in more that just appearances
I'm sorry but every time I look at the people in the back it always reminds me of the 'Dope' MV....
"Do you plan on having kids."
...
"Yes."
MAD FANGIRLS SCREAM
God hates liars, I hate liars
At 6:07 Eugene is like "gasp drama alert"
John is so mean XD
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"
zach looks so hot in this damn
that guy is like, the saddest man on earth
Hmmm I thought they already did this but again it look like they did something similar to this
I just feel like there ask bi
Zugene OFFICIAL!!!!
Eugene wants babies is the most shocking truth uncovered
Alcohol is a cheaper alternative
Imagine you lie but then he (the man) says " he's telling the truth " lol
Zach says he's going to be single forever yet he's made out with everyone in the office
I love them so much. Eugene though 😍😍
Eugene.... I don't want to say I feel sorry for him, but I do feel a ping of pain whenever he talks about himself and his personal life...
But God does not hate.
That lie detector interpreter was probably the most boring/dull person I've ever seen in my life hahaha
Lie detector tests don't actually read lies they tell nervousness and if someone was nervous the whole time truths would read as lies.
I never want this video to end!!!!!
I think Ned is hotter than Keith. Please don't hate me!
I'm very scared of John
'god hates liars, i hate liars.) John 2k17. soooooo does that mean that gods name is john and that he is a Polygraph Examiner?
It must be so awkward for the Lie person
tbh though...Keith is kinda the best.
'Nobody likes nuns. I grew up Catholic' Preach it Ned
dude said God hates liars and he hates liars well he just lied that God hates liars
John as the new try guy ... make it happen
I mean, he is the best of the try guys.  Love you all though :P
I think what they said about nuns is mean
God HATES liars! And I HATES liars!!!!
"I'm not a fan of lying, but I do have a lot of secrets." Me too buddy, me too.
DOES THAT MEAN THAT JOHN IS GOD??
john seems like a barrel of laughs
"I like being hooked up to machines" NO EUGENE THATS NOT SOMETHING YOU SAY ON THE INTERNET WHERE PEOPLE TAKE THINGS OUT OF CONTEXT 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The monotonous voice John speaks in is just hilarious.
Why is the polygraph guy so f*cking intense?
i love this video so much
I love this episode!
Dab
#ZacGene
I like John
I'd date Zach in a heartbeat.
"God hates liars and i hate liars" ..is he God?
"gods hates liars, I hate liars" wow that just turned creepy so fast.
Mexican try guy right here 👍🏽🤓
Wait is Eugene bisexual? He was in all those videos about dating guys or whatever but no one has actually confirmed it. I'm queer and I want to know if my baby Eugene is too.
democracy manifest
This video was so hot and I have no idea why
"God hates liars, i hate liars." Me: "Woo calm it down there buddy"
Scandalous.
I thought he was gonna take them
I love how everybody is shocked that Eugene wants kids
can john be any weirder? yeesh
The try guys should take pole dancing classes
CAN JOHN JOIN THE TRY GUYS PLEASE
I like john
Ned's like breaking down at the end. That shit's hilarious. "I DON'T NEED YOUR EXPLANATIONS!"
god doesn't hate anyone
buzzfeed is cancer
I want to be hooked with one of these to see how honest I am
I hate to be one of those people but Eugene is so unbelievably handsome I just...omg
"I'd kill her."
Lie detectors are not detecting lies. It is more accurate to say they are truth verifiers. The machine can't tell you if you're lying but it will show you the comparison between your normal body readings when telling the truth to how your body reacts when you are lying. For this reason, someone who may not be lying but the topic makes them feel uncomfortable or makes them think of something that happened to another person, it may show as "lying". This is why the polygraph examiner will do follow up questions to verify if it is a lie or not.
"God hates liars, and i hate liars."
Whoa this guy is intense.
I love these guys
hey my grandma was a nun
"I dont know those babies." -stone cold killer ned
Lie Detector does't work it just test your heart rate
7:22 broke my heart :(
"Eugene, do you know how much the three of us care about you?
No
He's telling the truth
Damn, we got to be better about that"
johns ready to fight lmao
Eugene: For sexual sake sometimes? 
Keith: No?
John: Keith is lying. 
Keith: Damnit.
3:57

I'm dying inside
lie detectors are NOT real!
John is a God
I wish I could be hooked up to a polygraph.
Eugene is hot in a suit
i think john has some unresolved issues in his life…
Eugene is cracking up in the back
S-U-S-P-E-C-T
LIE DETECTOR PLUS TRUTH SERUM HAHAHA
Can John the polygraph guy be a try guy
I want to hug Eugene. I bet he smells great. :-)
Polygraph's don't work. You just need to be calm
8:19
TryGuys try Colorguard
lol all John says is 
He is lieing 
he is telling the truth
who is that nut job, "god hates liars and i hate liars", nobody on planet earth has never lied, god hates everyone apparantly
JOHN: "ill kill you right there" lmao!!!!!
These don't even tell if you're lying it just has to do with how nervous u are and heart beat
I loved this video!!!! Thank you for making it long!!!!!!!!
john is god he said his self
John should be a try guy
I just want to hug all of them
God hates liars, and I hate liars.
fck, john is scary
😂😂😂😂 oh my lord
John is a scary man lol
Ned: "I don't know those babies" LMAO😂😂
"Everything's a toy if you play with it." Wise words, Zach 😏😏
Ned: "I don't know those babies" LMAO😂😂
Adam ruins everything theme plays.
You guys should try some cyanide pills next time.
If you want to say no but you know it's a lie, say yes weirdly so it seems like your lying
Zack is the best try guy
Do you think I'm ever going to fine love?

Ya..

Keith is lieing 

Haha(fake sad laugh)hahahahha....           DAMMIT KEITH
Am I the only girl who might consider herself attractive and has a thing for Zach?..
"I've definitely stole some pens from Ned's desk." 
"DAMMIT"
john tested add
Adam already ruined this.
Do more!!!!
Love it.  Love you - please Part 2 ❤
(Fancy rhyme huh 😏)
That was one of the best try guys videos
Put subtitles on at 7:00
There is no lie detector
John is from ADD
John is my favourite person in this.
God doesn't hate liars, he doesn't hate anyone
recent videos have shown eugene is really insecure sometimes
everything is a toy if you play with it.
anyone else notice that he said Keith is lying for Keith but he's lying for everyone else
how to ruin a friendship ep LOL
I imagined zach making out with potential co workers
I've been waiting for this my whole life.
-Zach: Would you give up fried chicken in order to marry your fiancé? 
-Keith:Yeah
-Everyone: WHOOOOOOOOAAAA
Haven't we already proved lie dectectors don't work.
John the best try guy
i like Eugene the most
He's telling the truf.
Yo, John needs some chill.
Sometimes when they are lying,they look like they are being so sincere omg.
OMG they all looked so nervous XD
Ned ask about a serious question about his marriage the zach ask him About fried chicken😂🍗
It's John from All Def Digital! S/O to John, lol!
I wish I was a try guy
polygraphs are garbage. anything to raise someone's heart rate can read as they're lying.
plenty of guilty murders passed polygraph tests because they kept calm and kept their heart rate in check
Zach is so cute I wonder he avoids getting into relationships
What's with the outfit changes
3:50 I CAN CHANGE THAT EUGENE.. pick me, choose me, love me..
So if Zach's made out with 3 coworkers, and there's 3 other Try Guys...
They missed the opportunity to call themselves the "lie guys"
This may be my favorite try guy video of all time. I was laughing out loud! Keith is the glue that holds them together for sure!
everything is a toy if you play with it... 😂😂
I don't know those babies
I actually think this is my favorite video from the Try Guys series 😂
John scares me
lol. the guy that works the lie detector  is the same one for all Def Digital
How do they make this kind of video without getting pissed at each other? _'
THE 👏 TRY 👏 GUYS 👏 ARE 👏 FREAKING 👏 AWESOME 👏
"god hates liars and i hate liars"
It's not a lie detector, it's a polygraph. It measure blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity. It doesn't detect lies. Lies are more complicated than just true or false.
Hahaha these things don't actually detect lies and only monitor blood pressure and heart rate(some of the fancy ones monitor sweat), so if it's a hot day and are nervous under pressure then all you answers are basically going to be lies. You can lie on those thing all day if you keep your heart rate steady and stuff. That's why sociopaths and psychopaths can and have passed lie detectors, later to be proven guilty to a crime they committed and were asked about on a lie detector, and lied
An honest person may be nervous when answering truthfully and a dishonest person may be non-anxious. Hence the test is around 70% accurate.
that was fantastic! Easily the best try guys episode
"Do you like neds dog?"

"...No.."

"..what..?"
I'll kill you right here 😑😂😂
I love John so much oh my god
Zach is the best!!!!! He's hot too
John tho he was so funny
I like that John fella
I really love cooking! It's my passion and helps me to stay happy and positive. Please give me a chance to show you my special recipes. I know I am a small YouTuber but please give
me a chance. Many thanks CD x
the polygraph is flawed
It doesn't surprise me that they all like Keith the most.
I wonder if polygraph tests can detect compulsive liars. I used to have a bad compulsive lying problem and half the time the lie would be out of my mouth before I knew what I was saying.
Anyone else think they look smoking hot in white shirts and black tie?!
It would have been perfect if John said:

"I'd kill her...John is telling the truth"
whats 9 + 10
do you think Zach will ever find love ? yes.... Keith is lying. that broke my heart
Part 2 with the girls pls :(:(:(
Damn Eugene is the only child of divorce in the Try Guys and his views are different than the rest of the them bc of it. I relate to that so hard lmao. It really does change everything for you
Zack-"Do you think I'll ever find love"
Everyone-"Yes"
He's lying 
😂😂😂😂
John is by far the best try guy.
When Keith said he would give up fried chicken for his fiancé it warms my heart. I want a relationship like that.
"God hates liars and I hate liars".
they do know that a polygraph is bulls hit right?
ZACH SO SCANDALOUS
John is quite popular. he was also on ADD
John seems so pissed throughout the video.
dude my anxiety world be thru the roof😂😂😂😂
Eugene ❤️
" I'd kill her" I died
Except the fact that lie detecting tests have been proven to be wrong over 50 percent of the time....
polygraphs just measure different rates in the body, not lies and are used by the police and put innocent people in jail.
These guys are awesome if one of them ever left I'd be so sad
I love John!!! He's so funny and great!!!
I got eugene and zach mixed up because of thirteen reasons why.
Like lie detector tests are fake
Polygraphs are bs.i could tell when they were lying
ill kill you right here
"I'll kill you right now."
... (Ned asks him the question)
"I'd kill her."

We neef part 2 of this.. all the through part 100 please and thank you lol
John is intense
Everything is a toy if you play with it 😂
hahaha best video so far
Y'all know this is fake right, go watch that Adam conover video
God hates liars and i hate liars therefore i m god
"John would you kill your wife or save a boat full of orphans?"
"I'd kill her"
this thing has been proven to be a sham. even by the guy who invented it.
JON!
guys, i think we need to save johns wife... 
"i'd kill her" 
#savejohnswife
7:19 We all know that laugh is full of sorrow...
Polygraphs are not reliable
"I don't know these babies " 😕😂😂😂
John scares me, but he's hilarious
fyi these lie detector are no longer considered to be valid
Wow, John is savage!!
"... I'd kill her."
😂😂
Of course Keith is the best!!!!! I love hem so much and he is the funniest 😂
John has no hope in humanity.
John: God hates liars and I hate Liars  Long dramatic pause John you are kinda creepy.
"everything's a toy if you play with it"
Keith would give up fried🍗chicken for Becky AWWWW
you guys all do know that polygraph tests don't work, right?
"do you think you talk too much?"
"well when you put it THAT way..." Zach is me
Eugene you're right it does mess with your brains
I WANT JOHN IN THE TRY GUYS!
lie detector test are proven not to work
Lol. A black member. I was thinking the same thing Zach and Eugene.
Eugene: A boat full newborn Italian babies 
Me: XD
The polygraph test doesn't work. Lieing is more complicated than heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate.
yea after this Ned definitely seems like a psychopath.
John is bae
gosh I love them so much 😭😭😭❤
I WANTED MORE SEXUAL QUESTIONS
Does Eugene have a fanclub yet?
"I don't know those babies" 😂
yes the omnibenevolent God hates liars
ha try guys have a lie detector test maybe buzz feeds team should do this to reveal all the lies they've been feeding you
Girl version?
"Everything is a toy if you play with it'"







that, my friends, was the invention of sex toy..
John oml
Ohmygod the lie detector guy is the best "I'd kill her" SO DEADPAN 😂
Buzzfeed stole Jhon from ADD
'I dont know those babies'
since when does god HATE liers?
Keith beat the detector at least once. I know things.
Can we have a part 2?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!
This stuff can ruin friendships girl bye
The try guys try psychedelic drugs!
Why replace a try guy? Add a black guy.
6:32 when Zach pulled out the lollipop I was dying
lol wtf according to this they are gay makes no sense ahha
I'm a normal human being. I see Eugine, I click the video!😍😍😍
Is that John from those All Def Digital videos?
That's why Eugene's hair is so big, it's full of secrets.
"I don't know those babies." xD
TEA TIME!!
grabs mug and sugar
grabs popcorn
"Everything's a toy if you play with it " 😂😂
awwwww, Eugene doesn't know how much they care about him
Try guys?? More like liE Guys hAh
hahahah Zach made out with three of his co workers 😂😂😂 he is so cute for that and I love him so much 💗
the way keith says scenario
Everyone loves Keith 😂
zach is a precious cinnamon roll that needs to  e protected from the world
what do you guy think later the video what happened to them?
"I don't know those babies." -Ned Fulmer 2017
Soooooooooooo
Eugene's Gay...
THAT'S FRIGGIN AWESOME
While this is funny, polygraphs are not real science, and doing them with your friends is so a recipe for disaster
They should do a spin off channel like lady like
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE FIB FINDER SAYS
ladylike next!!!!
Try Guys try to lie.
When Keith said "then we already know" I just imagined Eugene dominating Zach. o-o
"I don't know those kids" rofl Ned
PART 2!!!!!
Zac is the cutest try guy and that's what matters
Y'all gay bruh.
polygraphs are inaccurate
Eugene's the best try guy
Lmao John is a savage xD
8:13 the way Zach put his hand on Eugene's shoulder😂😂😂
John was having SO much fun doing this
John is my hero.
there inaccurate
lmao they stole the polygraph guy from all def
I love that Eugene has that sexy smirk on his face the whole time
I would never do this with friends or family, oh god no. I can't have them knowing im Hannah Montana
"I like being hooked up to machines." Ooookay Eugene...
a world without ned and ariel in love is a world I don't want to live in
How does the asian have an insanely redneck name?
are we not going yo talk about Zach's laugh at 1:09
John scares me.
THAT WAS HILARIOUS
I'll kill you right here - John
I like Eugene and keith
In the beginning I thought he was going to say, "God hates liars and I hate God." 😂
Impressions before even watching the video 

Zach will be nervous answering 
Keith is the biggest liar
Eugene will admit something strange I'm thinking he's like a secret serial killer
Ned doesn't love his wife as much as we think
yoooo that guy is deeply unhappy in his marriage wtfff hed kill her?!
I dont believe in lie detectors at all but i still want a part 2 of this just cause its super entertaining
Why is john so serious like wtf
Anyone find it it funny a chingy has dogs
Sorry I'm new here but is Eugene gay? because he's so cute! 😭
Ned just kinda looks like Bradley Cooper, at the right angle.
They should make a new reality tv show called "Everyone loves Keith
OMG THE EXAMINER GUY IS SO FREAKING STRAIGHTFACED, SERIOUSLY LIGHTEN UP LOL
Well damn John "God hates lies, and I hate lies"
ha ha ha SO FUNNY ;)
It's the same guy that makes all the lie detector tests 😅
awwww when keith said we gotta be better about that, i nearly cried, it was so sweet. and he must love his fiance a lot to give up fried chicken
Lol
I miss the old Buzzfeed :/
god hates liars
ur going to be exposed anyway so just tell the truth
Eugene is the best try guy
Should have asked ned if he on his wife
Am I the only one that thinks John is trolling them? 😂😂😂
Am I the only one that thinks Eugenes the best try guy and keith is annoying and should be switched lol
God hates liars.. and I hate liars
I'm here for Eugene
John looks so unimpressed
this machine is not intirely precise
Poor John lmao
Lol
I'm Italian
Damn! This video was so fun and nerve wrecking!.. pretty sure if you've watched this guys since day one you'd feel the same! 😭😭😭
John's remarks are so funny omfg! 😂😂
this is funny as hell
I wanted to see the EKG
Johns Vocabulary:

He's lying.
He's telling the truth.
anyone thinks that Try guys and supernatural buzzfeed should collab😂😂
omg i felt so sad for eugene from the believe in true love thingy. like i know he isn't the type of a sensitive person so he just shrugged it off but i think everyone deserve to feel being cared. It. Is. So. Sad to not recognized it. A message for you, Eugene. you are damn precious. you are loved by thousands people. you are cared. hell, everybody always talk about you in buzzfeed videos. So, please see how your appereance means to us❤
got the poligrapher is like a machine
Jesus Christ John, chill
I mean the real MVP of this video goes to the one, the only, John the Lie Detector
I DON'T KNOW THE BABIES
do the try guys try airsoft
Ned: starts saying stuff about John being old and his marriage is worse than his

John: I will kill you right here
I don't think they're supposed to move during the exam
Hahahaha, lucky Zach ♥
YAY, John form All Def Digital.
"God hates liars so I hate liars"
Polygraphs are hugely inaccurate though
i'm shipping eugene and zack
John is so serious it's great 😂😂
KEITH'S "YEAH" WHEN HE SAID HE'D GIVE UP FRIED CHICKEN FOR HIS FIANCE WAS SO CUTE IT BROKE MY HEART
We all know that polygraphs don't work though, right?
No one's talking about John! He's so funny!
Zach looks like he's going to cry the whole time..
" Do you ever want children"
"Yes"
Well well well we have so much in common Eugene.... lmfao
John is kinda scary
That one question about Ned's marriage vs John's marriage AHHAHAHA
John: "I'll kill you right here"
30 seconds later...
John again: "I'd kill my wife"
Why is it so surprising that Eugene believes in ghosts? He's in Buzzfeed Unsolved for Pete's sake!
John 😭😭😭😭
Jon: "I'll kill you right here." 
Ned: "Flabbergasted sound." 
The other try guys: "laugh hysterically."
di
John is kinda scaring me
I thought Keith was gonna say himself as the best try guy
god hates lying i hate lying  deeeppp
Interesting they didn't ask who they thought was the worse try guy 🤔 That could've been rough
...John scares me and idk why
Hahaha Eugene: I like being hooked up to machines
well, everythings a toy if you play with it

listen to that voice of your mom-----f you play with it...youll go blind
That detector guy is scary
The try guys do gymnastics 
like if u want this to happen!!!
Polygraph tests are bogus. it all depends on pulse and heart rate increase. its super easy to pass those tests
john seems really depressed
Zach' Parks and Rec reference at the end 👌🏻
WHO DID ZACH KISS THO
Best try guys ever.
John scares me...XD
that polygraph guy was awesome
can you make a part 2?
You do realize that lie detectors are not a real thing, right?
tf
Best video ever
Lmao that guy has is a fatalistic fetishist
Funny video :D
These tests don't even work, if you stay chill, you won't get caught. Criminals have passed it many times.
8:20 John: "I'll kill you."
try guys, unsolved, and ladylike are the only reasons why I'm still watching buzzfeed tbh
Excuse me but this is the same guy from Al Def Digital 😂
0:28 "God hates liars, and I hate liars" so why are you saying you can tell if they are lying using a polygraph? Which is a device proven time and time again to be ineffective at detecting if someone is lying. Do you hate yourself? Even the guy who invented the device said that he regretted ever inventing it, because it doesn't really work and has been used by law enforcement to put many innocent people behind bars.
god doesn't hate lol
on my channel I just posted me falling off my couch if you want to cheak it out my YouTube is P.J.C Videos I wanna hit 5 subscribers in 24 hours if you guys can make that happen! thx
Bit gay
It's so easy to cheat on these but it was still veeery entertaining :D the guest dude was really funny :D
I'm new, is Eugene gay?
They should add a really nice looking black man to the try guys
"Lying makes you go to hell" - DanandPhilCrafts 2017
0:27 Does that mean you're a backwards dog? AWESOME!
this is fake
This is probably the worst way to tell if someone is lying.
omg john is very creepy ..........
the try guys try lies
I really want Eugene to loom over me and whisper with his sleeves rolled up to his elbows like that.
1:04 seriously he wanted to put a penis in his mouth XD
The ship for Zach and Eugene has sailed!!!!!!
that john or whatever he's called looks like the most boring friend ever
John seems like a hoot. 
It's like level 500 Ron Swanson.
who hurt John?
damb john
Zach is sooo cute!
Wow i loved this XD This was so funny and the detector guy was amazing XD
8:20 I'm done
wow too much things got exposed I can't even
this video was just gayyyy
God hates gays, I hate gays.
You guys were cooler when you faked your videos! Wait...oh it's buzzfeed. I got it now.
John is a savage "no"
John: Imma kill you
"Its the only thing people told me was attractive" BUT YA HOT THO
I wouldn't want to be left alone in a room with the lie detector guy...
when Ned said he'd rather kill the babies than his wife because he didn't know the babies.. I inhaled so hard (because I was about to laugh) that I almost choked on a olive 😂
this is the best video in a very long time😂
L Y I N G  M A K E S  Y O U  G O  T O  H E L L
Imagine having this guy as your father😄😄
OMG  this was so funny!
They should've asked who's the least favorite try guy so it's even more akward
Wait... Wasn't the lie detector test proven to be able to be cheated?
What happened to Zach's neck?
what we learned today:
keith is everyones favorite
ned will kill anyone for ariel
eugene's hair is a product of his insecurities
no one thinks that zach will find love
I feel stressed out for some reason and im not ever there 😂😂😂
When they asked Ned if he has a better marriage than John! OMG!
ADD is way better then buzzfeed
Who else thought Keith would say "Keith" when they asked who his favorite try guy was
"I love being hooked up to machines" oooh
The test is the heart rate,if you stay chill, you won't lie.
Lol I honestly thought Keith was gonna say he was his favorite Try Guy
I bet Ned hopes Ariel isn't watching this.
john u a savage boi
Ned: Everybody has problems
John:*slowly turns head* I'll kill you right now
Me: DYING OF LAUGHTER🤣😂🤣
John is my spirit animal
i wanna know which 3 coworkers Zach made-out with
John is scarily intense.
7:45 - 8:38  best part  lol
7:06
o,o
CMERE LES MAKE BEBES >:3
this just made me love Eugene more tbh
sooo funny
Too bad polygraphs don't work!
Hmm.... that must be another brother of Ron's. John Swanson.
I love the try guys! mabuhay! from the Philippines :D
love it
Eugene says he's not the best, but when i look at the comments there are 100 girls talking about how great he is... YOU KNOW NOTHING EUGENE LEE YANG!
I couldn't stop smiling
Finally a good vid in YouTube I've been looking for something interesting to watch.😀
"It's not a toy"
i watched a gay porn one, the chick never came, but this is the gayest thing iv ever seen like cum on lips gay
john just made this video even BETTER
we fnally found something imperfect  on eugene :( he doesn't believe in love
petty that polygraph's are often wrong
"I'd kill her"
"Eugene, do you know how much the three of us care about you?"
"No."
"He's telling the truth."
"We got to be better about that."

aww
"Nobody likes nuns, Eugene" hahahaha!
Nunsense!
(i have to stop)
man alive, they always try things that could mess up friendships haha I couldn't do it
Doesn't believe in love, but, believes in ghosts... makes sense
its a polygraf, not a lie detecter. it has many flaws
Lying makes you go to hell
I love the way the lie detector guy says, "He's telling the truth."
Zach and Eugene my poor insecure babies.
8:10 LMFAO ITS 4:00AM AND I CANT STOP LAUGHING HONESTLY FRON HERE IN THE VIDEO ONWARD I WAS CRYING OF LAUGHTER
FINALLY...




Finally!!!
Try Guys more like Lie Guys
These four ppl are the best thing that could ever happen to Buzzfeed....
John is God
I wanna hug Eugene :(
Omg John is the best 😂
i have to take a polygraph test next week for a job so the timing of this video is scary
Prove I have a chance of being seen
When Eugene said that he doesn't believe in true love I got really sad :c
Those polygraph tests do not work
I'm pretty sure they got this idea from Revelmode. it's basically the same thing, except without the pie.
the lie detector test is fake you just cause yourself pain, breathe at a steady rate and lie on every single question asked that increases your chances of passing 50%
John needs his own show
"I'll kill you right here."

And thats when I died of laughter
Eugene is like me. I don't believe in love.
Eugene. I want you.

also, this is the best try guys of all time.
"I'll kill you right here"
Congratulation, You are officially god. You  start on Monday.
Eugene: I liked to be hooked up to machines.
I honestly can say I don't have a favourite Try Guy, I might like one over another depending on the video content lol
"The try guys" Lol
What's next? The try grandpas?
How does Eugene do his hair?
Eugene is beautiful just saying
Keith's "I didn't even get that" actually got me
LMBO! "I don't know those babies.."
"I don't know those babies."
These things just monitor heart rate
Cant tell if the lie detector guy is serious or not.
so is Eugene top or bottom with Zach
I was almost on the floor crying I was laughing so hard. This was amazing X,D
he's telling the truth
he's lying
The best try guy in my opinion is eugene, I just can't help it wow I love him(not in a romantic way aha)
Everyone sub to me and I'll sub back
WHAT?! NED AND ARIEL ARE JUST FOR SHOW?! I'M SHOOK!!!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"

They're one and the same
"Everything's a toy if you play with it" Zack stares at the lie detector guy weirdly
Woah at 2:51 zach's voice sounds like a womans
Lie detector dude is INTENSE.
God eugene😭❤️
the polygraph is a lie
OMG. John... Is like... Really boring...
7:45 is the best part tbh
Lie detector guy: God hates lie and I hate lies
Me: Jesus Christ
So if god hates lies and he hates lies..... is he god?
When you have nothing to say
Can we get John (The polygraph examiner) to be the next try guy?
i dont know those babies
John: "I'll kill you right now" 


I SPIT MY WATER OUT OML
HELLO GUYS!!!
John: God hates liars and I hate liars... *camera man zooms in" because I AM GOD
I don't know those babies! HILARIOUS
1:37 turn on automatic subtitles
"I don't know those babies"
this is probably my favorite buzzfeed video ever
THATS NOT WHAT THE FIB FINDER SAYS!!!!
Did Keith just pronounce it SEE-NAR-EE-O? NO MY BEAUTIFUL KEEEEIIITTH IT'S OVEERR
EUGENE I CAN MAKE U BELIEVE IN TRUE LOVE
HOW dare him lol
the polygraph is a lie it doesn't work
I love John, he is lovely
An entire episode on Eugene plz
"I don't know those babies"😂
Polygraph test aren't accurate. The guy who invented it says so.
That John guy's super serious about a technology that's known to only be used for intimidation, but is still used to this day despite the inventor saying that it really was nothing more than a children's toy (ironically enough).
Love eugenes personality
who is gay?
I was hoping Keith would say he likes himself the best out of all the try guys
lie detector guy is the same from the add def digital videos...
"I'll kill you right now."
187 Views, 22K Likes....Seems Legit
Lie detectors actually don't test if you're lying or not, they measure your heart rate, perspiration, and nervous system arousal. Basically that means if your heartbeat speeds up just from hearing something like the word murder, the lie detector notices that. Ergo all you have to do to "pass" one of these and make it seem like you're not lying is to already be nervous before the detector begins detecting your emotions and that way it won't come across as anything suspicious if your heartbeat is already fast when it starts. That or some people don't even react to hearing things such as "Did you kill this woman?" This is why innocent people have been incarcerated just because they get nervous from hearing these accusations, or guilty people gone free because they don't react to the accusations.
the lie detector guy John got hecka red before he said, "I'll kill you"
Those are not accurate readings, the questions were complex, and the situation put a level of stress that skews the results
I now ship Zach and Eugene.
6:09 zach and Eugene in the back
He sounds/looks like john goodman in cloverfield lane
lie detector guy reminds me of Ron Swanson
Eugene X Zack???😂
Ned- "Marriages seem to get worse when you're older...."

complete silence

Dude- "I'll kill you right here"
Try guys do prank calls
6:33 someone asking the right question
Polygraphs are just pseudoscience they don't detect lies...SO WHO WAS AND WAS NOT THE FATHER?
they should do the bachelor with zach and all the over 18 viewers who would date him
My girlfriend ist sleeping next to me and im nearly dieing because i cant laugh out loud
But Eugene is the best try guy!!!
poor Ned!
JOHN IS THE BEST
Awww point zach
I went to a school run by nuns. Yes Ned is right nobody likes nuns lol
8:20
10:17
I doubt that device actually knows if a person is lying or not..
John should be an honorary try guy
5:55 SANAAARRRIOES?!?!?!
"He's telling the truth"
Are not gonna talk about how Eugene believes in ghosts and that his mother is psychic?
The fried chicken question 😂😂😂😂😂
Haha wtf John
do more please
Did anyone else notice zacks bold spot
Can try guys not get their own channel like lady like whom have 2 different channels for just them
Can I be a Try Guy? I'll be the black member
I don't know this babies
John is the embodiment of my true feelings
lmAo
tbh, I'd go out with Zack/ Zach idk how to spell his name
John looks like a character from star wars
"I don't know those babies" 😂😂
It's all fun an games until you realize that lie detector tests aren't accurate and this only portrays them to be, which an extensive mislead idea has spread to using polygraphs in the courthouse, potentially convicting innocent people.
I wish my self esteem was as high as Keith's lmao love him
poor john
"I don't know those babies"
The guy looks so bored
The Lie Detector Test is A Lie
everyone was so surprised when keith said he'd give up fried chicken for his fiancee.
Where has John been hiding all this time? "God hates liars and I hate liars." LMAO!
Thumbs up for John.
Ned toasted on this hahahaha
I love john
"Would you kill us for your own life?"
This was great
Anyone noticed that John only mentions Keith's name before answering "... telling the truth/lying?" 
Everyone loves Keith <3
Why I quit buzz feed
Tag yourself i'm jon
My favorite one yet
2K views and 30K likes? Seems legit
BRUHHHH SOMEONES EATING A FREAKING LOLIPOP

Eugene: I like being hooked up to machines

God does NOT hate Liars, he hates sin itself. God loves everyone, gay straight black white Asian. doesn't matter
8:20 "i'll kill you right here"
I felt neds humiliation
EUGENE NEEDS TO ADOPT MEH.
"god hates liars" alright
I believe in ghosts too bitches
"I'll kill you right here" OMFG.
I'll kill you right here XD Dying!!!
"God hates liers, and I hate liers"
Lie detector tests don't work.
John came from ADD to buzzfeed, traitor
Very interesting video 👍
i'm an italian baby so killing the italian babies made me mad 😡

College Humour > Buzzfeed
Coke > Pepsi

Watch History > Search Histor
 Kittens > Puppies 
Give It A Whirl Fuckers > Try Guys
ILL KILL YOU RIGHT HERE...
Who is ur favorite out of the try  guys?
5:53 "What are these scenarios?"
The way Keith says it sounds like Mario.
Next time they should do this test for Trump vs Hillary, instead of debates only.
When they asked Ned whether or not Zach would be a good husband, Eugene started laughing right away!!!!
Polygraphs are horribly inaccurate and are easy to fake
The Polygraph Examiner is a real life Ron Swanson.

Eugene's the best :-) I think either Ned or Zach should definetly be replaced.. no offense
Eugene is so bogus for that question to Keith. Still funny.
"do you know how much we care about you?"
"no"
"he's telling the truth"
"we need to be better about that"
their friendship is so cute and wholesome omfg
polygraphs  are FAKE news
this was so funny❤💙💚💛
"Eugene, do you know how much we care about you?"
"No."
;-; Eugeneeeee
I want John to be an honorary try guy
7:45  power to you guys ;)

Please more lie detector tests!!! :D
"I'll kill my wife."
Why does all the lie detector ppl look the same in multiple vids on youtube and they are always keeping a straight face
okay....that was the most halarious thing I've watched all week :'D
Buzzfeed could learn a lot from College Humor. Lie detectors aren't real. They don't work.
i LOVE neds hair in this video

I'm not trying to hate, but Keith is really self absorbed, and thinks he's the funniest and the best in the group
I love John!!
keith is the best try guy
Okay Ned looked HOT in this lighting
What we learned:
Ned REALLLY loves his wife
Keith is super overconfident
Eugene had a weird childhood
Zach is a player but will also be forever alone
That lie detector guy is a legend 😂😂😂
2K views yet the video has 29K likes!

Zach: "Eugene, do you know how much the three of us care about you?"
Eugene: "No."
John: "He's telling the truth."
Keith: "..We gotta be better about that."

So sweet ❤️😭
I love John so much xD
Disclaimer: I only watched until 1:49 so if this changes throughout the video please correct me.

From what I can tell this lie detector "test" is inherently going to fail. you need to set a base line (they may have done this off camera, but from what is shown on camera they did not) by asking simple questions with obvious answer i.e. "What is your name?", "What day is it today?", "Who is the President of the United States?". From there you can ask your actually questions and compare them to the baseline (again they may have set the baseline off camera, it's just that the on camera stuff makes it seem inaccurate).
"Do you believe in true love?"
"No"
"He's telling the truth"
"AW" 
HAHAH
I feel like Eugene's the one who wonders what he can fit in Keith's mouth
are the three coworkers that zach has made out with.. the other try guys?
Legende em português pls
Does anyone else noticed how John will only call out Keith's name before mentioning the result but not with the other 3 guys?
I'm low key crying about Eugene
i wanted to know if eugene had pictured any other try guy naked
In the most monotone voice possible
He's telling the truth
31,000 likes and 2,087 ppl XD

this was entertaining but the old guy is weird like he is so shy
My dads motto of the house when we were kids was "Liars go to Hell", and I think that's why I grew up be such a bad liar.
John is just a ray of sunshine xP
I found it kinda weird that all the really dicey questions went to Eugene. I mean, I wonder why though.
"i don't know those babies"

You guys could make an entire series out of this. Obviously not with yourselves but with groups of friends and strangers etc
How does this vid have 30K likes but only 2K views
Zach just licked the lollipop thru the whole video lmao
funniest try guys episode in a while :D
These aren't even accurate??
this video made me kind of sad because eugene just seems like he has repressed all of his feelings for a long long time
I'mma need to see some pictures of Eugene and Ned's dogs... do they have pictures of them on instagram?
The try guys need a channel like LadyLike does
I kill you right here and now 
I would kill her 
-John the grumpy pants -JK
this is the best
7:23 how do i love and support eugene unconditionally
so who did Zach kissed hahahaha
God hates liars, and I hate liars.
Is this the same John from the ADD channel?
" I like being  hooked up to machines " Okay Eugene. Hahah.
Video has 2k views, 30k likes & 4K comments...so people just like and comment without even watching? Lol Now that's dedication..."I don't even need to watch it, I already know what's up" lol
Part 2 ? 
This is super funny !!!
"God hates liars, and I hate liars"  it's funny cause polygraphs don't work
those polygraph machines only go by how your pulse is
when someone so professional goes psycho.      it kills me😂
The man,
The myth,
The Jon.
God hates liars

NED YOU ARE THE BEST TRY GUY
What's good fam
"I don't know those babies" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

YESSSSSSS
Did y'all notice that John only said Keith's name? Like anytime he had the other members he'd say "he's lying" or "he's telling the truth." But for Keith he always said his name, "Keith is telling the truth" "Keith is lying." 😂😂 idk that's just something I noticed.
ned's devotion to his wife is amazing
John: "I'll kill you right here" 😅that man loves his wife!
THIS IS THE BEST TRY GUYS VIDEO
"Well,it is!"
petition to make john a try guy 

sign below
Keith's mouth is real weird like is it slanted or..?
Please do a part 2! This was super entertaining to watch!
I ship Zach and Eugene let's be real
But polygraphs don't actually work, they are a placebo, people say the truth because they think the detector will see if theyre wrong
Awww I love all of the try guys
Who else was smiling throughout the video?
Just saying...
God hates NO ONE🙄
John looks very serious about the lie detector.
It's John from ADD!
John is lovely...

John has no chill. 😂
Love him.
Technically, polygraphs don't detect lies, they detect signs of nervousness (i.e. Increased heart rate), which happen to coincide with lying. If you were nervous the whole time, there's a very good chance that even your truths would register as lies.
This was the try guys funniest video
Zach looked super nervous 😂
This made me love Eugene even more
Hahahahahahahahahah
try guys try going blind for a day. Go
I wish I could remain as composed as John.
"I don't know those babies."

Lie detectors don't work, they measure heart beats, blood pressure ETC, that doesn't mean you're lying you could just be sweaty or doing cross fit
polygraph tests are totally inaccurate because the person might not be lying they may just be nervous and naturally have a high blood pressure. also you can fake a polygraph test easily with breathing techniques and practise

youtube is broken send help.
Lie detector tests are yes and no questions that are asked and answered before monitoring them asked again once hooked up.  These off the cuff questions are not valid.  Also you are not allowed to move your head or fingers because it messes up the readings.  This whole video was for show and it a valid test.

This is fantastic
"I'm John. I'm a Polygraph Examiner. I've tested over 8,000 people. If I see one of them lying I will let you know. 
   God hates liars, and I hate liars."

Gee, polygraph examiner! For someone who is so against lying, why are you using such language?.. I believe you're trying to say God is real, and you follow this Gods will. Unfortunately what you really said is "God hates liars, and I hate liars(; I am God)".. You ended up looking like quite the narcissist.

By telling the truth in both statements you inadvertently implied you are God, because you are the one who determines who is lying... Answering with single words to the question format increases polygraph testing accuracy, so much that it is my assumption that it is required.

*I dislike buzzfeed. If asked, I'd say I don't care what buzzfeed thinks. By leaving comments on their videos; I show that I am petty. Though I'd pass a polygraph test saying "I do not care about buzzfeed" through linguistic manipulation I am not so disingenuous that I'd show disrespect to another human beings word, until proven incorrect. *
I love you John, so much
That guy was scary

Lie detector tests are bs pseudo science.
I love Keith oh my god
Lie detectors dont actually work. They just monitor your heart rate and people assume that when there heart rate or blood pressure goes up that they are lying.
I don't know those babies 😂😂😂
The lie detector guy was killing me when he told Ned he'll kill him
john is psychooo
Zach: You think you have a better marriage than John?

You know the "lie detector" test doesn't actually prove the person lying? All it proves is if someone has a strong reaction to a question asked, but that can also be from being nervous or other confounding factors. You need multiple sessions asking the same questions with the same response to have some confidence the person is lying about those answers; even then it doesn't prove anything. They used this back in the day just to scare criminals with all the high tech looking gadgets they put on you to tell the truth.

John - I'll kill you right here
john is creepy
it makes me sad to hear Eugene put himself down like that..........I think you are the most handsome guy at buzzfeed! Your hair is always on point, you are ridiculously sexy, and your smile could light up the darkest room :) even if your hair was flat or gone completely (like when you guys did the bald cap video) I think you are VERY attractive! You'll always be my favorite Try Guy <3
🙄
I feel like John has some deep personal issues he needs to work out...
This made me hard
I WANT BABY EUGENE'S

Sorry but lie detectors DO NOT EXIST
God hates liars and I hates liars
yssssssssssssssssssssssss
i wanna ask if u could find a less creepy lie detector guy but honestly he made the video better.. XD
what's cool to me is that the lie detector reads your stress levels, so if you're a naturally guilty person like Zach, you'll most likely fail it if you're lying. for someone level-headed like Eugene, it's easier for him to remain calm when he's lying, so he passes it more often.
So funny

YASSSS I LOVE THESE GUYS. THANK YOU FOR INSPIRRING MEEEEE :)))
I really panic and get nervous when questioned for something bad, whether I did or didn't do it and around authority, so I would probably come up as lying most of the time
Who Is next, the queen?
They should've ask about each other. 😂
Like "Do you hate __."
Or talk about buzzfeed.
I'm I the only one who got serial killer vibes when he said.."God hates liars...and I hate liars"...(cue creepy music and face close up)
When John is getting really angry inside...
"I'll kill you right here"
One of my favorite Try-Guys videos.
subscribe to me!! BTW just made a channel so i haven't done anything yet
"do you think I'm ever gonna find love?" "yeah..." "..... Keith is lying" i died😂😂😂😂😂😂

"Nobody likes nuns, I grew up Catholic." Same, Ned. Same.
I would ask Eugene "do you like explosions?"

When you sneak that Park's and Rec quote in at 10:16
John reminds me of Grumpy Cat haha

why does it say 177 views, when the dislikes are over 245?????????????
Jon is the boss
I mean, the polygraph is fake but this was funny!
I love Keith bless him
Lie detector guy: GOD HATES LIARS AND SO DO I  (What's he's trying to say: I'll kill u if u lie)
All of these guys are in the closet. Even.... ESPECIALLY the married one.
I'm afraid of lie detectors because I get really nervous under pressure and it'll look like I'm lying the whole time

"God hates liars. I hate liars" therefore he is God
A person who firmly believes in polygraphs also believes in Abrahamic God. Makes one wonder.
Audio mis sync
Eugene in a tie and shirt😍
afaik the polygraph machine doesn't really reveal anything about lying, there's usually a body language expert present who examines the subject and determines if they're telling the truth or not.
everyone was very shocked when keith gave up his fried chicken
Polygraphs don't work for detecting lies
The guy is creepy 0_o

Why is there 200 views and it has gone up 1 hour ago??
163 views yet 16,037 likes?! Huh.... Youtube is making a lot of sense today!
God hates liars? And you hate liars? You sir, are therefore a sinner, and so is God. God hates the sin, not the sinner. And if you choose to hate the sinner, you hate not only yourself by that logic, but also hate God, by that logic. Because you're a sinner and also projecting that sin on to God. So not only are you a sinner. But you're a sinner whom hates god. Because you're as sinner who hates those who sin by lying. And by hating the sinner, you are a sinner. And by God hating the sinner, god would be a sinner. And if you hate the sinner, you'd hate God. Oh, how I love exposing the hypocrisy of religious individuals.

This isn't accurate. You can't ask multiple questions in one session, and you can't ask questions when the person being questioned doesn't know the questions beforehand. You also can't ask open-ended questions, or have the person reply with anything other than a yes or no
Bitches gone be like "I need a man who will kill a group nuns and newborn Italian babies for me 😍❤️❤️😪"
the lie detector is easily messed with
Ned totally burned Zach with the marriage thing.Zach forever Single.Ned forever married.Screw Keith and eugene

157 views and 15,372 likes???
THX YOUTUBE
Post more JUST try guys videos, just the four of u
But sadly thou Polygraph can be easily manipulated to ones advantage thus make the test worthless. How do I know, well I watch YouTube late at night when sailing the seas of YouTube. So I'm pretty much an expert at this point.

well John's a bundle of joy, isn't he?
PART 2!!!!!!!!
Eugene though, doesn't believe in love and doesn't know how much the others care about him, feel like we need a Eugene appreciation day ^-^
Wait.... does this mean John is God?
WASNT THAT LIE DETECTER GUY FROM THE OTHER YT CHANNEL TOO? THE ONE WITH THE TEDDY DUDE
Tell me if I'm lying: There is only 156 views in this video.
I have anxiety problems so I know that even if I was 100% truthful I'd probably still fail the test. The environment alone would stress me out too much
John, the guy with the computer, was hilarious!  He played his character so perfectly.  Hahaha.
Omg I love them so much!!

You can pass that easily. just stay calm, lower your heart rate, and slow your breathing. it measures blood pressure, sweat, heart rate, and breathing. the more anxious or excited you are, the worse off you are

a lie detector is not accurate. A lie detector was once tested on a plant and the detector said it was lying. The lie detector is entirely based on sweat, blood pressure, and heartbeat. That could just mean you are very nervous.
118 views, 10,983 likes.... seems legit
Below 500 views squad
Lie detectors don't actually work though... they don't tell you if someone is lying, they only tell you if someone is nervous. Sometimes that correlates to pinpoint a lie, but it's not 100% accurate and if you know enough about it it's easy to beat
how is this vid having 118 views and over 10k likes?????????????????????????????????????????????

Eugene will more likely sink the boat full of Italian baby orphans than let someone pull out a strand of hair from his head.
John is literally the human version of grumpy cat
"Divorce does stuff to your brains" yeah it does. that ain't a lie.

Some of the answers you could tell just from their faces.
Aww Keith is willing to give up fried chicken?! woah
Lie Detectors aren't real. It's shiz.
The Polygraph test isn't reliable
Lots of criminals passed it just by staying calm
"I'll kill you right here" ....well that was forward John
the detector guy is like a statue, he literally just stares at the screen either saying he`s lying or he`s telling the truth



i wanna be like him :))

the polygraph is pseudoscience nonsense.
 it doesn't detect lies. it detects stress. 
you can be innocent and fail a test.
you can be guilty and pass a test.
it all depends on how levelheaded you are.
Why is it that when Eugene said that he's the only one in the try guys who has a divorce parents, it f**ked up my brain 😂😂 i dont even know why
Zack is adorable, I'd date him.

lol cool
there is no such a thing like the best try guy! you all are the best in your category! Eugene is the sexiest, Zack is the cutiest, Keith is the funniest and Ned is... the wifeiest! ;)
You no nothing Jon Snow
I'd like to point out that polygraph tests have been debunked by scientists and even the guy who made it. Polygraphs have been passed by a number of criminals and there are even classes that teach you how to pass them; polygraphs measure your heartbeat and if you focus it is easy to pass it

EDIT: It also accidentally incriminates false suspects due to them being nervous about it, increasing their heart rate
6k likes, 52 dislikes, 1k views, and only 67 views. Nice
Yeah.. Honestly i like Keith the most too
77 people have watched this vid and this have 6k likes :D

Haven't polygraphs been proven unreliable for years now..
Ned's achilles' heels was definitely Ariel 
btw they should've just asked Eugene if he was gay. I'm sorry but sometimes i'm wondering about his sexuality...
That little cub needs to TRY GUYS ;D

Lie detector tests are such pseudoscience. They don't measure honesty, they measure changes in bodily functions like heart rate. Knowing that and a little practice makes these tests super easy to beat.
That was interesting, I would do that with my family.
the polygraph test doesn't detect liars

god hates lairs and i hate liars, therefore i am god
lying makes you go to hell
Is John acting like that on purpose?
It's ironic how the lie detector itself is a lie
It seems Eugene doesn't appreciate himself enough.
Eugenes laughter is so cute at 6:20 oh my god
Lie detectors are unreliable and everyone knows it. It just tells if your nervous or not

Yeah, Eugene, what are those scenarios? I mean weird but hilarious. C'mon Ned is always going to choose his wife over everything else, he found his soulmate.
at least i watched the whole video before commenting
Ned: "I would murder the nuns"
John: "He's telling the truth"
Zach: "Its an easy question the nuns are typically old. They're at the end of--"
Ned: "Nobody likes nuns Eugene, I grew up catholic."

"God hates liars, and I hate liars."  So John is God.
These tests don't even work. You can lie and be calm to mess with it easily, and if you have ADHD like me you could be telling the truth but be told you're lying because of fidgeting. There's been countless proof that these tests are often inaccurate.
;)
