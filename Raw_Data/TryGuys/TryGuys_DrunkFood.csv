Though a restaurant from my hometown (that has the best fries) has been experimenting with Poutines lately. Eg. CBR (chicken bacon ranch), mozza stick, brisket, pulled pork, mexi, perogie, breakfast ( has hollandaise and an egg on top), and more. 

From there, I tried a burger called 2 pigs and a hen, which was a burger, pulled pork, bacon and an over easy egg. It was amazing.
