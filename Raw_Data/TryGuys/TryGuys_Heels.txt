Keith's fiancee and Ned's wife are gorgeous
I can relate to eungene so much. His dancing is so me
EUGENE! OMG MAN HES SO WILD
Heels are fun. and also it's great fun for me to be taller than guys lol. don't worry Zach! some girls enjoy short guys. just gotta get use to taller ladies lol
Eugene liked sexyer then the others
Respect ladies 😏😏







impressed
"CAR! PLEASE! FUCKIN PEOPLE!",
zach was the only smart one because he got a block heel
trust Eugene to choose high heels called dagger pumps...
who was the chick that Eugene danced with
"But I make these high heels work"
Dose it make my but look good 😊
Keith's fiancé is so lucky
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SEEMS SO UNCOMFORTABLE !! EUGENE WYD ?! (Zach was so adorable tho omg)
zach is so cute i'm
Eugines dancing:
6:07
DANGIT EUGINE STOP BEING SO ATTRACTIVE
(but dont actually)
DID I JUST SEE DORMTAINMENT?
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORRKKK
Zach was the only smart one and I supported his decision from the beginning
I'm fourteen, I'm five foot two, and I'm an actor. That means I'm expected to wear heals in every production I've ever been in. For the last show I was in I was asked to wear six and a half inch heals. The way I was forced to practice was dancing. Hip hop dancing. For three hours straight, everyday. Then followed by singing and acting. Y'all are little bitches.
I can't wear high heels over three inches cause if I do I'm a hazard to everyone and everything
if you pause at5:47 there at a strip club look at the GUY on the pole in the corner....... OMG
THE TRY GUYS TRY POLE DANCING PLEASEEE!!!!!!!
I have a feeling Eugene would actually wear the short boot heels on a regular basis
SAAAAMEEE and I've been wearing high heels since I was 4 years old, more than ten years, but now I can wear 8-10 inch heels for like 8-10 hours walking around and surviving 
PS: Go Eugene, work it boy!
I LOVE NED AND ARIEL
Can anyone please tell me What "lgbt" means?
I think Zach would still be taller than me even if I wore heals.
omg Eugene! SLAY! love the shoes, love the dance moves and poor your feet
Welcome to the pain of women. I get blisters from my heels. I wear flats and tennis shoes as much as I can. Be happy men that u guys r not women.
"My fiance painted my nails.",well if that ain't goals...
6:23 i wanna be that girl..
Eugene killed it though
"welcome to the real world"

i would pounce like a mutha fucka 

lmao judge me idgaf
At 16 I had 13 pairs of dagger pumps 👠 


Is that bad
Those people who can run in heels. HOW???
who was the girl who was sitting in between Ariel and Becky
I loved Ned's outfit!
Six inch heels . . .She walked in the club like nobody's business. 
Damn. She murdered everybody and I was her witness.
but I make these high heels work
I could make it the whole time but I'm male
When you drink, it distracts you from the pain- A Tale of the Modern Woman
4 men can walk in heels like nothing 
me: falls wearing flip flops
Being drunk this video is so depressing. Come on Eugene just work it, stop complaining
I wish I was that girl Eugene danced with...don't judge me.
I just came here because Buzzfemifeed disabled the comments on the manspreading video. 😂 alright
So Eugene just looks good in every thing, that's just a fact. But out of the rest of the Try Guys, I think Zach looked the best.
"I'm a foward thinking man, I'm responsible.. so imma get drunk." -Zach
can u do move videos of this plzzzzzzzzz
I love high heels and wedges idk y
Eugene looks hotter than me in heels.
Eugene's legs doe
Interesting, Eugene can dance in heel but cant walk on one probably.
Eugene can dance with hills better then me
Zach had it easy. I survived a whole school day from 7:45am (and I walked to school, so actually it started at 7:20am) to 3:25pm with 10cm (about 4 inches) without platforms and in the end I barely felt any pain.
I would actually wear Zach's outfit. 😍😍
we must admit that ankle boots are easier to handle than the others
I am in love with eugene
today my friend took my phone and made me sprint in heels... lets just say now she might be missing a couple appendages
I like Zachs shoes the most I would wear those I hate high heels
I'm 11
In my 3 inch heels
I lasted 7 hours at school I'm 3 inch heels
Eugines shoes tho!
it looks very cute on men
"They'll motherf in kill you" Eugene on dagger heels 😂😂😂 these boys never cease to amaze me!
Before you make fun of someone, try walking a mile in their shoes. That way, you're a mile away and you have their shoes.
EUGENE....DAMN
wow why is eugene so delectable haha
Ya know guys.. I'm gay but damn Eugene.
They're gay for agreeing to this
How is Eugene still single
What song is playing around 06:15?
Eugene cannot ever look bad in anything
2:32 TOO HOT
I would wear zacks booties
Why the hell am i watching this over and over again 😬
lol ned and eugene were  asking for a death wish with stilettos lol u need some platform boys
For wacky tacky day at my school a guy wore 4 inch red stiletto heels lol! He could walk perfectly fine, twirl around, and he even did a jump in them 😂😂 it was amazing
"this is Lady Gaga" :))
Honestly Zach looks good in those
lame
These guys really make my day with their videos and their honesty. Thank you. :)
Keith: "dinner is sittin'. Sittin's great☺️" breathing so hard trying not to laugh.
Okay now that now how is girls feel in heels
Dagger high heels? Don't theraten me with a good time!
can we just talk about how Eugene survived til the last two with DANCING AND DANGER HEELS vs Zac who just had comfortable boots and didn't do as much
the try guys shold
Ned is hilarious
"i may have made a terrible mistake... but i look hot" 😂
Hate to break it to you Eugene but you were not sexy walking in those things. waddle waddle -- Props to all four of you tho. You're more hardcore than me. I'd maybe survive a night in Zack's choice but I'd hate myself for it. Besides, I'm 5'8". I'm happy in flats. Hell I'm happy in sneakers.
There is something satisfying about men suffering from heels. because they usually don't have to.
All of you slayed those heels 👠
To be fair tho, not all heels kill your feet. I have a pair of heels that I cant bring myself to throw away even tho the suede is fucked because they are literally so comfortable and my mum has an open toed beige pair that I always steal cause they're comfy (neither have the large heels, like zac was wearing) You just have to find a good pair & get used to the ones that hurt/get super wasted so you don't feel the pain.
I could wear heels when I was 6
Eugene was giving me life dancing like that yesssssss lol
Eugene at 2:32
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
poor Ned 😂😂
The way he says toenails lmfao
how can people wear that!?!? wtf?!?!
"That tush got the push" - Keith
HAHAHAHAH that killed me
every comment.............Eugene.
the best pearl is when you take off your heals and it feels like heaven has blessed you
on Canada day my sister wore heals and she almost got her ankles broken
6:23 wth
I never understood the purpose of heels. For my 18th birthday I was given 7 inch platform boots. I wore them on my birthday but they haven't been worn since then. That was about 8 years ago
Haha Ned "See ya!"  splat Man Down! Man Down!
when eugene started to start dancing in that bar i started died it was so darn funny
I actually like zach's heels
5:31 - "hold my earrings"
I love heels ONLY on fun nights out. It's fun to dance in them. You feel great. Afterwards, it feels like a hangover for your feet, but it's fun.
My daughter is ten and she has already started wearing black heels
I love Zach's ankle boots :-) they're so cute
They're amazing I could never do that XD High Heels are too much of a torture for me. Comfiness for the win
I really like zacks heels
Does anyone know where to get Zach's boots? (UK please)
Honestly Zach's heels went the best with his outfit
ok but keith's nails look hella cute
Eugene is FABULOUSE
6:15 - same song that the buzzfeed girls danced for in the "Women Train Like Professional Dancers For A Month" video in Boldly.
Not gonna lie. I wanna be that girl dancing with Eugene
Don't throw those heels in the bin
"my fiance painted my ta-nails" - keith 2017
I NEED MYSELF A BOYFRIEND LIKE ZACH HONESTLY
zach x eugene ♡
Eugene walks like a velociraptor.
I think Eugene was challenged by my dance teacher😐🤔
Zach lookin' fine.
I LOVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM
I wore  heels for 2 nights threw wut they did was a piece of cake
Eugene UGH working it
Who is the middle girl? Eugenes gf?
Gaaaaaayyyyyyy!!
0:38 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Eugene is flippin amazin!!! XD
"What advice do you have for us?"

"Don't."
Ok, last bar is a stripper bar.... I didn't wanna see that!
This is the best video I've ever seen!
try guys vs a point class
So when I get to the dumpster I take off my high heels ohh so good 


                                                                       


                                                                                     DUDE YOU SOUND HIGH
I have got 4 inch high heels and I can run in them
I feel like Zach has the outfit I would actually wear. It looks really good!
Eugene looked hot!!!!!
Eugenes wearing Barbie heels!
I love the ankle boots
0:37 dont worry zach i cant compete with 4 inches either
I would totally have Zachs they're so cute
Well this was fun
Eugene makes those high heels work
I've wore heels for about three hours and they didn't hurt sorta cause I like heels but I guess the last pair of heels I wore were like 4 or 5 inches
Zach is rocking those ankle boots they match his outfit perfectly
Eugene is just unbelievable
I think Ned get handsome more and more
🔫🔫😈😈👌🏿👌🏿
I dropped my phone on myself @ 6:12 lofl
I think Zach looks the best
I wore 5 inch heels at so many events and I was wearing them for a full day. I couldn't walk for two days after each of those events, but it was worth it cause I looked fabulous. I'm 13 for god's sake
Eugene started off on a suicide mission. Zach was the smart one.
Fun Fact: Heels were originally designed for men not women.
Lol, I only last 0.5 bars, forget 2 or 3.
Now that they have tried each part separately. It is time to really try a day as a woman. Power suits, bras with weighted boobs, make up, hair, and heels for a day at the office followed by a night out.
"You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels"  SAMEEEEEE
where did Zach get his heals those were f ucking gorgeous
The way Eugene said "I motherfucking danced" in that voice made me like "bOi"
Where did Zach get those heels? I want them.
Zach was going to get hit by a Rolls Royce...
He could've made some money that night
SOMEONE GO GET TAEHYUNG TO SHOW THEM THE WAY
Those ankle boots looked the most comfortable to walk in a wear your toes aren't exposed and the heel is wide which makes it easier to stand because when you're partially drunk and or tired those little sticks tip you over and the heels on ankle boots help hold you up
Eugene.... hats off to you man. I can NOT wear heels for love nor money.... well... maybe for love BUT NOT THOSE
I am an a 11 year old girl and I can last in high heels for up to 3 or 4 hours.
Though I haven't really worn heels, I'd wear Zach's anytime.
how do you f*****g dance that good?! Damn!!
2017
still wanna have Eugene`s baby.
Zach was smart
Zach dropped it like its hot lmfao stooooooop it
I'm convinced that Eugene is genuinely gay.
Eugine is so extra😂
Zach's boots were so cute they looked really "normal" with his outfit. I just love Zach
am i the only one who doesn't even have a problem with stilettos, even walking, and im 13???
I wore 2cm heels and got 5 blisters. Imagine what would happen if I wore proper heels.
They all look gay LOL
Idea: the try guys try hiplet (ballet crossed with hip hop)
Anyone else think about the song Don't threaten me with a good time by Panic! At The Disco while watching
Eugene is my sprint animal
did anyone else notice that Keith wasn't wearing a blue checkered shirt this video!?!?
Petition for the Try Guys to start wearing heels.
This is the best video 😂
how is it possible for eugene to get even hotter?!?!
They were at the stripper club
1:43 - 1:49
Now i ship them so hard
the only thing I have say about the suletos is the people that chose them are idiots
I can't wait till Keith will start saying my wife
I'm so in love with Eugene 😜
i love how everything eugene does is to impress his family
This vid is less about wearing heels than it is about going to bars. >_>
Ned really looked good in his heels, it made his tush+legs look incredible!
try guys try periods, boob weights and heels at the same time for a day
Lost a bet to guy in a chiffon skirt…
I just, they look so much better on guys
Why does guys wearing high heels look so normal???
Eugene look so classy/casual/stylish in this outfit😍😍😍😍😍😍
perks of being a toe walker: heels don't bother me no matter how long I wear them
high heels where originally made four men they where a sigh of manlyness
I made a terrible mistake............but i look hot
Fuckin Work it Eugene!
Zach looks so cute hahahah
Damn zach looks good with those boot heels
YES EUGENE YES QUEEN😍👏🏼😭😂
Try guys should try cheerleading
I want Eugene's shirt
Eugene hates Christmas yet he's so hot so it doesn't matter. Plus that curtain swish though. 

"I hate Christmas but u love unwrapping stilettos " - Eugene
Eugene looks hot
Keith is frickin' 6'6 in those heels jesus
ASK BRENDON URIE FOR A HOW TO PERFECTLY WORK HIGH HEELS👏👏👏
I Fuckin LOVE heals!
I frrreeekkkkinnf love eugine
"I may have made a terrible mistake... But I look hot"

Imao Eugene 😂😂
EUGENE THO
Honestly I think boots with heels look great on guys, typical pumps no but just normal boots yeah (boots with heels was originally made for men to appear taller in history, so I've heard lol)
I think society should be more accepting with this border between what man and woman should or should not wear, it looked great on Zach and he aced it~
The boots were wayyy better than the rest 😂I can wear boots, I can't wear anything else
Zach looks the best! he looks the most comfortable aswell
5:45 Eugene😂😂😂i CAN'T 😂
"I didn't take it off cause I thought I could last through the night, and my mom and sisters would be proud".......... don't worry Eugene.....we're still proud of you and those six inches sexy as heels(｡◕‿‿◕｡)
try guys are the best!!!😍😍 i love them!!! 💕💕
Woman choose to wear them. Your point is?
protect ned at all costs
That's why I wear shoe's that are comfy and don't hurt me.
Why is this so satisfying to watch 😩😂
"sitting is great." yep the best idea for a man in heels :)
I was inspired by Eugene.   " I motherfucking danced".       Now I'm in L.A.   Don't know how I got here
look at Eugene's t-shirt!! awwwwww
advice???? don't 😂
Is it sad that they can walk better than heals than I'll ever be able to 😂
Once I accidentally stepped on my dagger heels and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches, Oh my gosh the irony😂
I LOVE EUGENE
EUGENE IM LAUGHING SM
Eugene is my goddamn inspiration.
They made those high heels work
I honestly never have clicked on a video so fast
eugene lasted the longest yet his shoes were probably the worst and zach's were the easiest
this is why i never wear heels.
Cool fact- Heels were made for men to make them seem important.Women started to use heels after it was invented for men.
most men hate heels because it makes women too tall and they dont find them attractive. They aren't comfortable and if no one likes them why wear them?
Wow I love zachs heels.... I personally think they work well with his outfit
When are Keith and Becky gonna be a thing
I need the shirt that Eugene's wearing
Put them in chiffon skirts cuz' they make those high heels work
I Love this so much😻 and Eugenes dancing tho ... Marvellous.
i found it so cute that eugene had painted toenails tbh
Somehow Eugene got a girl...whilst wearing 6inch stilettos... how?
ngl zach's heels were really cute
Legendary
i wonder what people said about this
-He said Welcome to the real world

OOOooooøoooohhhhhhh
Ned and his butts...
EUGENE STOP BEING GOD DAMN HOT MAN.
Like a wear Eugene's heels and I can even run using them.
Btw they all looked hot.
but I look hot lololol 😂😂
"when you drink,  distract you from the pain " that explains many of my nights 😅
I would wear zach's outfit
WTFFFF how come they didn't tripped all over their feet
Eugenes looked really good XD
"Sitting is great"- Keith
Eugene is so tall
Zach's outfit actually looked good and comfortable damn need to tell me where u bought them clothes
omg, u guys should totally try going trick or treating with heels!!!! That's what I do every year,and im pretty young(12) so I do need to run and I also try to get to the most houses possible and lets just say its not horrid but not amazing either.like and reply if u agree!!!
Wait am I the only person that likes wearing heels? 😂
I need Eugene's shirt
These are so dope
I don't know why the girls act like walking in high heels is so difficult.
all I could think was LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK



okay but zach actually looked amazing if he wants to feel taller and still be comfortable he should get elevated insoles for his shoes protip right there
I really love this episode. I wear heels 6 days a week, normally 8 hours at work and then dinner and drinks after most nights. Its great to see other people understand what kind of pains they are, and what people do to look good in today's world. Sure they hurt, but nothing feels more powerful than when I step into my 6" red stilettos and hear my heels click against the floor at work.
The boots are too comfortable for this challenge. It's so unfair to other guys
I had to pretend to be a frozen Queen of Hearts for four hours in heels I can't.....
How are you able to wear those?! I don't think I would last one hour-ish .
Dude Zach had the easiest shoes what the heck those aren't real heels
Every girl in my whole family has had some sort of 
Incident with heels. My cousin shara on the other hand broke her knee cap in half well walking into a formal dance wearing flats.  Now thats talent.
Eugene is officially the Buzzfeed's Daredevil
Eugene popping dat booty like a pro.
Eugene: you are my spirit animal if you see this and you are man enough I want a dagger dance off
Dem heels 💃🏻👠👡👢
I think the heels Zach is wearing should be made available for all men...
Is eugene gay?
Who else wants to party with Eugene? XD
If I'd have to wear those dagger pumps for a night I would come home with a broken ankle.
I was laughing so hard from 6:12-6:30 I choked lmao
it's absurd how hot Eugene looked in those heels in that outfit
i love eugene's heels
Is anyone else on a Eugene playlist
Ned actually has very nice legs lol
Zach's shoes are my favorite. I would wear them. They seem the most practical.
Eugene's dancing has got me shook beyond reason
Who's dat man walkin' down da street, w/ dem delicate feet, it's Zac!
well, they make these high heels work 😉
How come the try guys can walk in heels better than me???
I cant even walk in flats without falling over let alone fuckin heels lmfao
Eugene is zaddy lowkey! Lol
Am I the only one who cringe over this? or is it me?
"What advice do you have for us"
...
"Don't"
Did Eugene lose a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt? CAUSE HE MAKES THOSE HIGH HEELS WORK!
eugene is hot
mkay.
zach you wear those heels EVERYDAY from now on cuz u nailed them
this is them with heels but this is me with sneakers so um yeah
heels
When Eugene where's heels better than you...
They literally felt everything that I feel on a regular basis; I wear stilettos and pumps everyday and this is precisely how it feels, now people can finally empathize with me.
Zach has the only pair of shoes I would consider wearing.
am I the only one that would prefer heels over flats and finds them comfortable?
oiii the ankle boots are cheating. Those are pretty comfy, not like stilletos.
Ned's wife is so annoying/bothersome/in everyway it can be said xP
P.s.Sorry for my english,i'm an italian girl ^^'
When your mum asks you to help her with the shopping but you can't find any shoes around.
I literally died when I think Ned spoke about pool. 'It's about bending over and sticking out that toosh' I'm deceased
I needed to wear heels for four years in my university, yup...
I love Zach's boots
I'm so glad I realised I was trans before I got old enough to go to bars, or I would have probably been peer pressured to wear Eugene's kinda shoes
Dude I love the look of heels but I CANNOT stand wearing them. I'm in agony within 10 minutes. Do I still buy them? Yes.
I wear some type of heel everyday, but even I don't think I could last very long in a 6 inch heel. My rule of thumb is the longer you're in them, the shorter the heel. For all day I stay between a 2.5 and 4. Also, the further the distance between the heel and the sole of the shoe the more comfortable they will be. Usually the taller the heel the closer that gap is and that's why they hurt.
This was great. To be honest, sometimes I wear high heels BECAUSE I don't want to stay out too late. Then I'm like, bye. LOL
Zack or Zach probably would be comfortable.
SLAY MY LIFE EUGENE
"almost got hit by a car".... was that a rolls roice... HA I woulda let myself get him lmao
I am loving this so much!!!!
Every situation explored 😂😂😂😂
How short is Zach?
The fact that Eugene's heels were the tallest (6 inches) and he done better than most of them, proves something.......
Haha being a girl with heels is hard. So dont challenge them to race u unless u r using heels too
Buzzfeed couldn't pay me ENOUGH these guy's must be desperate for something, Money, Fame IDK, you have men saying there actually pretty cute. Buzzfeed own's you but this was really funny so you have my respect
These guys are heroes.  Like the soldiers who invaded Normandy.
These guys didn't do heel training! I walk around for hours in heels before wearing them out anywhere to make sure I can walk in them
The weirdest part? Removing them after like 8 hours and feeling like your heels are sinking into the floor.
Why is Eugene a better woman then me
Lmao! This was so entertaining! Poor guys....This is the reason I don't wear heels, maybe a slight wedge but that's it!
Get a pair of Jeffrey Campbell or Dr. Marten heels!! I can wear those all day and feel great ;)
Cucks
Eugene was DRUNK
As someone who can run and jump in 4 inch heels this is hilarious
YAYAAAA   NEWW VIDDD I LOVE YOU GUYSS
If you find a comfy pair of 6 inch heels you're set 😄
Those boots actually look good
I dont think eugene like girls...unfortunately  he is a hot asian
DAT guy with the white pants looks hilarious
Make a: :Tomboys wear heels for a day"
I mean ... I can go to Disneyland for a day with those boots on ! I doesn't count !! 
But I would never wear a six inch dagger heels in my life , it's just ridiculous...
can i be honest right here? ZACH'S SHOES ARE SO CUTE. i love zach's shoes so much 😂 i cant wear high heels because im still to young but i live how they look. i get it they are hard to wear but damn they look so cute. i remember when i was 8 i wore these high heels that where ping and where strapped on. i tripped but still walked on 😂 being the 8 year old me. i lived them 😂😂
Honestly one of my favorite parts of being a tall girl (5'9") is not having to wear heels.
I always laugh when ned talk about his butt look good 😂
The worst thing you done was take them off and put them back on. It's like drowning, coming up for two seconds, trying to gasp for air but then you gulp water and drown again
My daughter is only 12 and she wears her older sisters 12 inch stiletto high heels!
I dont understand how she does that!?
Zach's shoes are nothing
Eugenes are the worst
I'm gonna day this rn


DAMN EUGENE U A STUD THAT GURL WENT FULL HARD DANCE MODE WITH U
Gurls who would u be in this vid:
Zach
Eugene 
Keith 
or 
Ned
I'm a Zach how about u guys
ok, feminise men...let the agenda continue.
I like their confidence and personality but I don't think they pull off the heels well.
TBH, if someone showed me a pic of Ned waist down in those pants and heels I would not think it's a dude
I didn't know Keith was engaged! :O
Eugene's a sassy mofo. I cant dance but he CAN!
Please try mani/pedis with fake nails lol 😂
I think the ladies are done!
I love Ned lol
lets face it only two men had real heels the other guy just had princes old boots
They should try pointe shoes and start doing ballet. It's frickin hell
I love that they were lowkey at a bar with half naked men
Try red bottoms ...
Um I don't understand why heels hurt other people no matter how high all my heels feel fine 6 in fine boots fine thin fine
Zach looked adorable and precious in his ankle boots oh my god
it would have been cool to see them reference buzzfeed's own high heel hack article.
wtf what idoits
everything who make women more useles are hot? shoes, nails, dress, rings.
Zack's heels look so good on him!
Eugene slayed it. He picked the most brutal heels ever.
worst job someone could have is to do videos for huzzfeed, even aftican kids who work 12 hours a day for no money have more dignity than this company
Oh my god LOL. 
Eugene got friggin lit.
The joys of being tall and not needing heels to still be taller than every other girl at a party :)
The Try Guys are still alive!! Yes! (Boo Squad Wars)

"I'm so much taller than normal!" Quote of the year!
next time girls try rubber shoes lmao
there was this one time I went out in 6 inch heels and everyone else took off their heels towards the end of the night but I decided I wasn't going to be that girl and didn't.... I legit could not walk the next day worst pain of my life¡
I cannot even stand in those 6 inches heels , Eugene fuckin slayed it
i hate eugene
Eugene was next level
Eugene slays
Came here to read comments on Eugene's butt!
So why are they wearing high heels?
I'm absolutely screaming eugenes dancing is outrageous
I hate when I wear heels for too long and my feet hurt more when I take them off😢😢 I have really deep arches so going back to flat hurts sooooooo much
humping and grinding isn't dancing.
Why does Ned's Put Lady Stuff He Always Says Does Is Make My Butt Look Good (I freaking like)
so anyone notice the rolls royce?
let's be real, zach looked bomb
That Eugene butt tho!
Zack almost got hit by a ROLLS ROYCE
Women choose to do this to themselves, the free market only gives them what they buy, this is not patriachy or oppressive to all you idiotic feminists, but just reality, also, there feet are different
Oh god Eugene.
High heels for men should become a thing
Zach made the most comfortable choice.
A child in Africa could've eaten those heels... I'll see myself out
I  mean Zack has the easiest
Eugene is like a striper in that one clip 😔😂
heels are hell
Zach was smart and wore a chunky heel.
Does Ariel work for Buzzfeed now? I love her.
Reasons why men should wear heels if they want
1. They make you taller and if you're insecure about your height, why not do something about it?
2. Unintentional leg workout
3. CALFS.
4. Ugh idk u do u
DAMN EUGENE
thoseee..🍑.....😛😍
Eugene got me feeling some type of way
As always Zach pussying out being the only one not wearing stilettos
why am i so attracted to eugene in heels
EUGENE IS SERVING LOOKS
I love Eugene so much this man is pure joy
now everyone knows not to judge drunk women at the end of the night carrying their heels and walking bare feet! they arent trashy you just dont understand XD
there are more than 2 genders
They should try ballet for 16yrs.
YAAASSS Engine Saly boy slay
I GOT A BTS AD AHHHHH
Eugene is the best tryguy like honestly
What's sad is that they rock those heels better than I could ever
I'm actually living for Zachs outfit
When my friends and I go dancing, we make a bet. Who ever takes their shoes off last, gets a foot rub from everyone else
flat out feels SOOOOO good omg
they lost bets to a guy in a chiffon skirt...BUT THEY MAKE THOSE HIGH HEELS WORK
I'm sorry but Zach's heels are not even baby heels 😂
Gosh that woman who got to dance with Eugene!
"Normally, I'm carrying my friends home who take off their heels. Tonight, Zach carried me home." TRULY FRIENDSHIP GOALS 🙏🏼
:/ i am a girl and cant do dat
Wurk it Girl Oo lala
eugene can pull off anything
guys if this comment gets 1000 likes i will personally go to buzzfeed headquarters and start a massacre for gender equality
Eugenes' dancing is MOTHERTRUCKING GOALS...
You should see Kim Taehyung! He can wear heels and even dance in them without falling😂🙌🏻
Nice video BTW
WHY do they look good in everything especially eugene
I love zack
I think Eugene actually lasted the longest because of how uncomfortable Dagger Pumps are.Zach lasted just as long as Eugene but ankle boots are actually very comfortable and the most comfortable out of the group
what the hell is wrong with buzzfeed
get legs.
I bet they lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt but they make these high heels work
I just LOVE!!!
1-eugene's sass 
2-keith's humor 
3-ned's " does this made my butt look good"
4-zach 's reactions and pureness
tmw Eugene looks better than you in a pair of six inch heels😐
The inspiration to this video was that they lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but they made their high heels 
W O R K
Freakin' Eugene though... 6:12 to 6:30... How does he manage to be so awesome in every video?
I'm a woman and I won't wear heels for thirty seconds, much less a whole night. And Eugene, Sweetie, you don't need Satan's footwear to look hot.
I think they are running out of ideas
if I see any comments saying "SEE THIS IS WHAT WONEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH ..." I swear imma rip those
 flats off ur damn foot and slap u with it
Eugene's inner drag queen came with when he put on those dagger pumps.
it's never a try guys video until the comments talk about how hot Eugene is and until Ned talks about his butt or his wife
Watching this made my feet hurt
The funniest video I've ever watched hands down!
The Try Guys are squad goals!
Wow, Eugene can move in six inch heels better than any woman
Eugene got a new gf LOL
Pause at 7:47, you're welcome.
Imagine these guys wasted and on heals
Oh that's guys masculinity is so fragile if he is intimidated by a woman taller than him. I think he is called Zach...the rest of them are fine!
Sooo... Some grown men went around town in heals with polished toes...

I LOVE THE INTERNET!!!
10/10 would wear Zachs and Eugene's choices on a night out... bc I have, and still do 😂 #sufferforfashion
This was entertaining! 
The boots are the only one I would last in a whole night. The dagger heels - half an hour probably. Walking  = hurts like hell, but when you dance and move your feet you don't really feel it as much. Alcohol makes it better...
Of course Eugene where's dagger pumps 😂😂
Well at least Eugene went for it yaknow
I like the bootish shoes
I mean, we have to go through a lot of pain and/or discomfort, but we have way more moments of sheer bliss than men do like taking off our bras or heels. Men only really have that moment of bliss when you can finally pee after almost busting.
oh my gosh, eugene's dance slayed my soul. STAHP
Zach's boots are so cute! I would wear those
WHOSE THAT MAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH THE DELICATE FEET
...were they at a strip club at the end ????
okay, but zach's heals absolutely match his outfit and I love it
"because the stiletto is so tall, they'll motherfucking kill you"
since when ned is so hot?
wusses
not my proudest fap
sooo gayyy
Their total ineptitude at walking in heels is what really got me.
Zach's outfit was lit tho lmao
Watching a bunch of dudes who we all know are up for anything just go on and on about how horrid heels are..(wel, besides the height addition and butt improvement lol)....makes me glad that I do not own one pair lol.
8:01 He nearly got hit by a Rolls Royce. I would've taken the hit 😭🙌
:))) you guys look so funny!!
they lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt
THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS
A BUZZFEED COMMENT SECTION!?
2:32-2:35 OMG SLAY
6:11 dies
Omg @2:30
If Zach likes being a lil taller why doesn't he wear man heels?
Zach looks so good in those forreal....petition for him to wear ankle boots heels regularly...
I can friggin' sprint and do my soccer practice and karate practice in them :I So, basically, I think this is disappointing...
Eugene and Keith were my favorites in this video. Eugene was slaying in those heels. And when he hit the dance floor it was over. Boy was serving looks and moves 😂😂
Eugene is my queen I love him XD He just slays me so much!
damn. Eugene's dancing.
The ankle boots guy made if work😂
6:15-> My boyfriend does this on a daily bases.
"I may have made a terrible mistake...but I look hot."
Same, Eugene, same.
If you got heels that tush has got the push
Zach is the only one with half a brain, but took his heels off the same time as Eugene wearing the dagger heels which means he's weak because those boots look hella comfy. Eugene was crazy for going with the dagger heels, but his stubborness made it work, Ned and Keith went ooh pretty when they really should have gone for practicality. There are two types of women who wear heels- women who can wear stilettos and women who wear ankle boots. Also, its not just a question of walking in them, because you can just horse step on the ball of your foot and have no problem, you also have to make it LOOK GOOD.
damn eugene
that song zach sang was the highlight of my life
Am I the only one who thinks heels aren't that bad? Like they barely hurt my feet...sure they aren't practical for walking for extended hours at a time and it's a relief to take them off at the end of the day...but walking in heels isn't that hard to do haha...but then again I took pointe for two years when I was a preteen so heels is nothing compared to that trauma lol
Flc num x um 😇 dhzudbxjxjxxjxbh,hgbxbcbcbcccksjqlzozm,.. . BB zuzxhfvvzjzbxcnffbkdjxixjzidjxizjxissiuffj
Is it weird that I'm the exact same as Ned???😂😂♥️
at the beginning  I was praying for these  poor souls
Tbh Im Eugene when i wear heels
Of course Eugene wore the highest heels
in all honesty i kinda wish men actually wore heels. they just look good on everyone.
Zach and eugen looked so good omg
Ok so they screwed up by going out in new heels. Gotta break those in man. It helps.
I want Zac's shoes!
one of the many reasons, I wear trainers/sneakers to parties rather than heels.
If Zach didn't wear those ankle boots, Eugene would have won by far, he also was so right, he looks so hot in heels
Can the Try Guys try teaching?  That would just give me life.
This is more beta then then the greek letter that comes before gamma.
The Try Guys are amazing for this one!!!
"I motherfuckin danced"lmfao
can i have Zack's shoes please?
Eugene. dear god, you are the only reason I watch buzzfeed anymore.
Almost all women's dress shoes are uncomfortable heels or no heels.
of course Eugene had to be sooooo extra XDXD
Buzzfeed should make a channel called Buzzfees try that would have Ladylike and Tryguys
yeh ok i see your point but zack looks gorgeous in those heels
I wear heels everyday and I love it. I run and jump in my heels. WIMPS!😂😂
zachs are boots...that seems like cheating
I literally have the pair Eugene has. No joke.
"Being a girl is easy" 

how bout that
Eugene is so incredible
I'm laughing because you guys are struggling yet I wear my Heels/Wedges every single day and my feet never hurt. Come on men you got to step it up most these Heels are a walk in the park for me and they don't hurt that bad. Best shoes ever made thanks Men!👠😂😂😂
EUGENE JUSST KILLED ME JFC
eugene had it worse. his heels were very high and harder to walk on. even girls cant do them
I.......I love these men
ankle boots are easy mode
I've taken an uber 5 blocks before because #heels no shame
They just threw out those pretty pretty heels 😭
Eugene , why so hot ?lol He looks better in stilletos than me lol
Those shoes that Zach has on really goes with his outfit.
Zach could totally rock those boots all the time. Nobody would really bat an eye.
when eugene could asian squat while drinking and wearing stilettos..
is Eugene gay?
Eugene is my inner fashionista 🙏🏽🙏🏽
dayuuuuuuummmm Oujean you are rlly geting down!
If I ever wore heels I probably just trip and land on my face
I AM LAUGHING SO HARD AT EUGENES DANCE BATTLE THAT I AM DROOLING
I have the same heels as keith
i died when kieth said "to-nails" 1:10 😂😂😂😂😂
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CIFFON SKIRT BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK (if you get this I love you)
I want Zach's shoes!
zack looked the best
This is why I don't wear heels.
"Keith? Would you be a deeaar?" I swear Ned is just married to everyone. Ariel has to share him with all of the Try Guys
eugene is the asian one?
i have the same shoes as zack :)))
H
GOD DAMN!😍😍
😑
They can walk in heels,I can't even walk in tennishoes
I love how the guys are claiming they look F*** hot, but they walk like a drunk duck...
OMG i laughed SO hard at this!
I was about to click on another video when I heard a voice at the very end and thought wait, who is that? Then I realized that's the sexy sound of a hung over Eugene😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
High heels were originally made for guys, actually.
where can i get eugenes shirt?
I am 4'9", or 146cm to be exact, and I have damaged all my toes through childhood. I absolutely cannot wear heels, and if I try, then I wear wedges for a very short period of time (or sit the entire time). When Zach mentioned his frustration, I feel you, man...
My mum always wares heels and he's no flats
lol, they look so fabulous!
"IM NOT AS THINK AS YOU DRUNK I AM"🎶
the ankle boots actually looked good, like I wish it was more normal for men to wear them lol, they actually were an improvement
7:35 that pose thooo...HAHAH I SHIP ITTT
i feel like they were exaggerating so much... or weren't distributing their weight properly... or have a really low pain tolerance... idek but there's no way the heels hurt that much, esp the short ones
I Love Zack's shoes they are very easy to walk in and they look very good I have those😂
EUGENE DANCING IS MY AESTHETIC
wtf they're all (EuGENE I MEAN EUGEn E) really fuckin hot
Eugene is so fab
They walk like ducks!!
I feel like this has to do with their knees. Like maybe you haven't noticed but usually, when guys are just standing without moving, they tend to slightly bend their knees rather than "lock" them back like girls do (I said USUALLY okay. You can just watch people at a bus stop if you want to check by yourself.) So when they have to walk in high heels it's not a natural position for them, I suppose...
Props to eugene to stay at that heels!🙌🏼 but funny how zack's heels are pretty much my everyday shoes 😂
I love how they went to a stripper/dancer bar - and then they talk about their mothers,sisters and wives
Why do I feel like I watched this exact video two years ago
I love Eugene 😂
I kinda wish the ladies wore heels too. they could have showed off some girl power. no. doubt the ladies would have been a lot better at walking in heels
que Brendon Urie in heels and the song dont thearten me with a good time
really, try guys? you do suffer a lot 😂
I use heels like Eugene has for night out but I wear as high heels with wedge on normal days. I dance ballet. My feet are used to it. I have the muscle in my feet for it. To go straight out to those... I'm amazed he survived. I lift my hat and bow to thee.
masculinity is toxic!
but ladies, 2:32
Is Eugene into girls ?
Heels are the reason I have confidence. When it comes to a point where you can run in 6 inch heels, you know you're going places.
buzzfeed sucks now. like wtf is this though?
Eugene is the best thing about Buzzfeed.
LOVE MY HEELS ! NEVER TAKE THEM OFF !! BUY BEST !!!! THEN SUFFER FOR LOOK!
I have heels higher then the boys even though I am only 10 years old
EUGENE LOOKS SO GOOD
Y'all should do try guys try figure skating
I sware Eugene was secretly having fun in those heels
Everyone is talking about Eugene, but why is no one talking about how cute Zack looked in his little boots??
ZACH LOOKED SO GOOD
WHY CAN EUGENE ON HIGH HEELS STAND BETTER THAN ME ON REGULAR SHOES
The try guy should make each other bentos.
I'll give props to you guys because if it was me I'm probably not even gonna last an hour 😂
And Eugene looks hot.
"I may have made a terrible mistake, but I look hot."
😂😂😂😂
"So when i was challenged to dance, I mutherfuckin' danced " - Eugene 2017-2017
zach is my favorite one
wtf Eugene lol
Low key a girl could wear the exact same outfit, Zach's outfit
Where they find such nice heels to fit the guys? Don't men have a larger foot over all and wider toe spread?
you could look crazy sexy without wearing heals
Eugene is a better woman then I am
Damn Eugene impressed me and I love zach but his shoes were by far the easiest to walk in they weren't even heels more like booties
The girl was probably enjoying that dance with Eugene :,)
My attraction to Eugene continues...
I would only last in Zacks heels... and they are the CUTEST
if i saw these four guys out at the club with heels on and cameras out, i would be so annoyed..
their heels match their personalities on a whole new level
"alright only the hot ones are left, let's do this"
"i almost got hit by a car, that was super chill"
usually i'm eugene but rn zach is meeeee
they definitely lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt guys
eugene would
I love 6" heels. But It's hard to find here. I mean a good stable perfect pair of 6" heels. 
higher than that I never heard before. but in the comment box I read some people discussing 8 and 9 inches. and now I wonder how it's. coz I have always worn 3-6 only. 3 is nothing. but 6 makes you to be a little careful. how does it feel to wear 8 or 9?
1. Eugene looks so attractive in heels I gtg
2. Going straight from high heels to really flat shoes will hurt so make sure the flats are not too flat:)
Is it just me or does Zach look good in heals😂
I can get down with a night out in ankle boots. One their probably comfortable af ( I haven't had a pair yet, so I wouldn't know), and 2, ankle boots are MY personal favorite heels, Except for red bottom stillettos. Give me those daggers.
Eugene is an amazing dancer. That's definitely not something I can do in three inch heels, the highest I own. Hell, I couldn't do that in my flats or Converse.
eugene slays my life 😻😭
ministerio aviva
Even about heals the only thing that matters for Ned it's if it makes his butt looks good
I'd wear what Zach is wearing.
Y'all I'm really hoping Eugene got that girls number
Eugene looks great in every MF video 😘😘😘😘😘
BUT I MAKE THESES HIGH HEELS WORK!
Brendon Burst through the door
Keith and Eugene are my favorites (sorry if I spelled any of their name wrong)
zach was the smartest with those platform boots
Yas Eugene, you're my spirit animal
i use really high heels, but only with a high enough platform. You still look cool and good but your feet aren't that close to the ground so they wont get hit or stepped on and the curve of your feet isn't that bad.
Let's be honest, Eugene looked the hottest
Eugene you sexy beast 😂😂😂😂😂you dance better than most strippers 😂😂😂😂😂😂👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Omg that ending to the last sekond, but eugene did take the worst High heels
I think uegene will rock these and walk perfectly!
Can we not encourage the idea that dancing in stilettos is a normal "female" thing?  Not only is it simply counter intuitive if you want to have an enjoyable night, but you literally become a danger to other sandal-clad women with your dagger feet.  I swear, some of this calling out what "women have to go through" trend is just a subtle way of  encouraging women to make their own lives harder than necessary.  Don't do winged eyeliner or contouring if it stresses you that much.  Wean yourself off fuckboys if they're such a problem.  Wear stilettos for literally anything other than aerobic activity.  Or at least don't expect men to sympathize with your completely voluntary foot pain lol
I could not stop laughing! That phrase is so true. I have seen so many people in so much pain that it is just sad to watch. That is why I choose to not wear heels unless I ABSOLUTELY have to! I am glad that some guys now understand how women feel but I also feel bad for y'all to have had to go through so much pain. Love y'all! Keep up these amazing videos.
I'm actually just here to see all the Don't Threaten Me With A Good Time comments tbh
god, I saw the title of the video and immediately thought of dtmwagt, what has my life come to
wimps ;) Heels aren't that bad, get propper fitting ones and they're okay, even for longer periodes of times. Yes I can walk in heels.
Eugene marry me
ZACH LOOKED SO COOL IN THOSE HEELS LIKE HE DOESN'T EVEN LOOK STRANGE AT ALL
Zach's heels were the cutest thing ever and I think it should be more socially acceptable for men to wear them. Mean should be able I wear everything women can and vice versa, I don't get why all this separation exists.
Every boy needs to do these videos just to see how hard day to day life is being a girl 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Eugine slays harder than anyone I swear. Anyone else thinking ru paul drag race? He would be a legit competition!
The give it a whirl fuckers everybody
Zach : "Uhh I'm like being tall" 😂😂😂
I would walk just like them if I have heels on.
Is Eugene gay?? Is it rude to ask? I'm just curious :) he seems very gayish or maybe bi :)
lol 😆
KEITH BAS A FIANCEE???!?!??! OH MY GOD I AM SO LATE TO THE BANDWAGON WHAT
CONGRATULATIONS!!! May the both of you be as happy as possible for many years to come!!
I like heels, but don't like being taller than everyone else, since I already am tall :( but that would be okay, what I really don't like is that my boyfriend looks even shorter than he is x.x
looks exactly like how I walk in heels 😂😂😂
the only thing they skipped is pregaming and then having to go to dinner and not eat because you can barely fit in your outfit already 😣😂😂
Of course they would party in weho. If they did this in another part of la they be harassed. Well how entertaining anyways. :).
for a wee - wait, whaaaat? a niiiiight? Ha! It is just a sign for how painful high heels are. 
Wear "lalala" for a week. Yeah, right.
guys wearing heels is the equivalent to a dog wearing socks.
2:19 LMAO
It's worst when you have tiny feet and have to add inserts in your heels. Totally changes the dimension inside the heels designed to accommodate feet and gets your toes and part of your feet scrapping against the heels in random places that the shape of the heels would normally not do so.
I wore 6 inch heals to a wedding and kept them off for 9 hours. I was dancing and jumping around for 5 of those hours. my feet were bleeding but who cares
they went to a...strip club??
Heels are not a fashion statement, it's a deathwish
Keith is engaged!!!!
"WHO'S THAT MAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET, WITH THOSE DELICATE FEET? IT'S ZACK!" XD
OH MY GOD THEM MOVES THOUGH
I was at the zoo with my two Korean "sisters" and they walked around in the zoo for about 4 hours in like, 3 inch heels. HOW??????
Zach is a high heel legend
Lol
When Zach dropped it like it's hot 😂😂
Wow.. I'm a girl and these guys walk 2000000 times better than me, I had to have my friend teach me how to walk in  1 1/2 inch heels XD
EUGENE? MORE LIKE YOU QUEEN OML IVE NEVER SEEN SUCH DANCING IN HEELS THAT HIGH
the booties and the dagger heels 😍
Eugine is full of surprises
i ware 6 or 7in heels and i walk perfictly fine.
Eugene is a blessing
Well, heel were invented in days of olde, when moats were sewage and people dumped their waste into the streets. Woman started wearing them to get their feet out of the disgusting sewage. RANDOM FUN FACT!!!!!!😊
The boots!! I love them! But i cant get them because I would probably give them away and go back to my sneakers and flip flops   i dont care about not looking hot anymore i just want to be comfy
Eugene's shirt is everything, I WANT ONE!
'You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels' LOL that was so funny
why tf does eugene look better then me in high heels????? plus that dancing tho damnnn
if your going to heels those boots with the fat heels are the most comfy BY FAR
I WAS SCREAMIGN WHEN EUGENE WAS DANCING OH MY GODDDDDD
they wore heels way too big, when you wear heels, specialky with open toed heels, you need to buy one size or two sizes smaller. Glue two toes together, and wear little "shoe cushions"
Okay but where did Ned get his heels? I need them
zach probably made the smartest choice out of all of them when picking heels
Zach's shoes are the only ones I would likely last a full night in
I have walked 9 hours in heals HA I WIN
At 6:27 Eugene got down!!!!! I want to wear those heels now!!
Eugene should wear heels everyday 😍😍😍
It's official, Eugene is sexy in absolutely everything 😂
Zack needs to get punched in the face. Those short squatty ankle boots should not have been a problem and should have lasted all night.
I like the boots,no but I also hate heels I mean  seriously have you people seen what the crap does to your  feet
When the pills just popped in and they workin better then ever 6:08
"Because the stiletto is so tall, it'll camera zoom motherfuckin' kill you."
YAY!! Keith, congrats!!!
Don't worry if your sisters and mom aren't proud of you cause I am lol
Who else just screamed.....





BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
WHAT IS EUGENE'S SEXUALITY?!?
I once wore 3 in heels for 5 hours without taking them off. I was 12...
6:24 Who I think I am
6:29 Who I really am
Ned is so freaking adorable omfg 😂💕
Damn Zach looks good in those boots
I wear heels and honestly I feel the heel to toe is so not the right way to walk , anyone else feel this way too?
So fabulous
For a next video with the Try Guys, please have them go into a Primark in Britian (maybe in a different place for each of them), and with only £150, they must buy clothes for themselfs that they like, andaybe as a competition to see how has least amount after; and also they react to if they like Primark in Britian, because many women of all ages really like it, but you never see what men think of Primark, so it woulx be intresting to see each of them do a haul and their opinions and if they would go again. Hope this helps ans is a intresting idea. 😆😆👍👕👖👔👞
The Try Guys have to dance in heels, inspired by the Britains Got Talent video of the three french guys dancing in womens heels. Each of them havd to learn the routine from the video of their audition, or from a professional. 😆😁😁
Zach was lucky
Oh dear those booty makes a girl jealous😂 these guys pull off heels soo well
You guys looked awesome hot 😱😱
Eugene dancing.. wow 😱  what a night 😂
I want to see them in point shoes. (bellet shoes... but like on the tip toes..)
Of course Eugene who hates hugs and Christmas wears the fricken dagger heels 🙄😂
zack looked so good! and if they made him more confident, i support him wearing heels more often
At least Zach almost got hit by a Rolls Royce, so the guy will have the money to pay for his hospital bills.
zach's shoes are so good + go with his outfit + could be worn on the reg and i'm a fan
Eugene is ❤❤❤❤❤😍
When u are a Panic! song irl
When I wear heels...I actually have my flats in the bag
eugene, you are brave my friend
Oh, yes. Eugene's heels are amazing! I would honestly wear those.
T'nail
Ned and zack are my favorite guys on the series they look so alike and their personalities are the same as me
in which,  zach was the sensible one
8:06  a stripper bar..... nice job guys
here in scotland THE 12 YEAR OLD AND UNDERS CAN WALK IN HEELS BETTER THAN THEIR PARENTS TAKE THAT FROM ME -12 AND MY SISTER -7
My friends are drag queens and without heels a couple of them are like 6ft4 - with heels they are nearly 7ft tall and they can walk/dance/death drop in heels perfectly meanwhile I can't wear heels for any length of time - hate those buggers haha
Okay but Zach's entire look is super cute with those lil booties. I would wear the hell out of that outfit.
I feel so uncomfortable seeing Eugene and his heels
I think men in heels is my new favourite aesthetic! Wear dem heels boys!
Uber nerds
And that is why I have never once wore heels a single day in my life.
The try guys, worth is and unsolved are the only reason I still watch buzzfeed. They all need to go solo and make their own chanels.
Zack with the ankle boots looked the best
1:11 my fiance painted my t'nails
"I got catcalled" .... he said "welcome to the real world" not "lemme see them tiddies"
Always tape/bandaid your toes before going out in stilettos.
1:11 "My fiance painted my tuh-NAILS."
you guys are weak. im 13 and went to a family event with 4 inch stiletto heels and walked the entire time. the event was from 12-6. my feet didnt even hurt, im naturallt good with heels (including 6 inch, my limit for those is after 2 hours of wearing them.)
"You pop on four extra inches, guess what, I can't compete with that."

Phrasing! Boom!
06:28 I'm legit dying
I'm thirteen and wear 4 inches pretty much everyday 🤣😂
That's something my husband would do every weekend at home lol just to make me laugh
"Welcome to the real world" Ned: Oooooo
Eugene is crazy wth I would never wear these😂
the only things that hold me to watch buzz feed because of eugene, ned, zach and keith... if not because of them i already quit watching this channel
I love how the others just went with 2-3 inch heels and eugene went the high route with 6 inches
I. can.  walk in. heels.  and. I'm.  7. years. old
"ONLY the hot ones are left" Sorry Ned, but Zac got out, PLUS you're still there. JK, love all them handsome men ❤
EUGENE IS BEAUTIFUL
EUGENE KILLED IT THOUGH AND HE HAD THE WORST AND MOST PAINFUL HEELS
2:32 IM CRYING
Eugene can even get laid with women's heels on. Wow.
Eugene can even get laid with women's heels on. Wow.
I love Eugene soooo much
Ned has the easiest
this was so funny
how has zach not found a partner HE IS PRECIOUS
I'm already annoyed at how fabulous Eugene is compared to me (as usual) 😑
"I may have made a terrible mistake....but i look hot" 
Me Be Like: ...HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
I knew that's Eugene's leg in the thumbnail not because there's eugene's face but beacuse of those Hairs on his legs 😂😂😂
Of course Eugene gets the 6 inch heels lol I would NEVER!
lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but i make these high heels work XD
the try guys should try mermaid swimming with the tails and all the props!
yOooOooO eugune!!! 2:32
dont kill me ok thnkz
Eh I wouldn't count the ankle boots as high heels.. but I guess they're good for beginners
Guys can look great in heels... once they get over that walking part where they look like they pissed themselves that is.
Dayum Eugene geeettt itt
Their at at strip club
OMG i have the exact same ones as Zach :)
I have had and experience with six inch heels and it was straight up hell
i can handle 3 inch though. But i stay away anything that goes up to 3.
Did Eugene come out of closet?
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK!
Eugene is soo extra omg I love it hahaha
Zach's heels were the most comfortable looking and also the best looking one. Smart boy. 

I usually only wear wedges but even then, I just need to take it off and walk barefoot after a couple of hours. I completely understand the bliss on Keith's face.
Eugene's dancing omg!!!
Eugene is my spirit animal
Jesus I don't know if there drunk or there like that 








Thats awesome XD
MAN NED IS ROCKING THOSE HEELS
Eugene wearing a shirt with their names on it 😂❤️
Vaginas around the world just synced up watching this vid
Um??? Zach's outfit with the booties was so cute ??? I want that outfit
7:48 that is art.
EUGENE AND NED LOOK SOOO GOOD WTF
6:23 oh my glob 😂😂
is Eugene gay?
Me walking down the street seeing them I would literally run to them like ahhhhhhh!
there was a male stripper in the back
i wear the shoes Zach wore, except I do it for about 7 hours every day. :p
I find them comfy
2:31 YAAAAASSSS QWEEEEEENNNNN SLAAAAAYYYYYY
wow they last longer than me in heels lol i cant even wear a six inch heel without tripping over
Keith's fiance is soooo cute
2:29 OMG EUGEEEEEEENEEEEEEE
Eugene got laid that night
Of course Keith's toenails were painted blue...
Okay, but Zach, the style thats hes rocking. I love it.
Eugene's sexuality? nun of y'all business
My feet hurt just looking at Eugenes heels.
Okay.

Zach went smart.
Keith went cute.
Ned went with the booty poppers.
And Eugene went crazy.
New video idea:
*ahem*

"The Try Guys Try To Find SOMETHING that Eugene Doesn't Look Good In Or Pull Off Or Do Flawlessly Cuz OH MY GOD THAT MAN LOOKS AMAZING IN ANYTHING AND CAN DO EVERYTHING LIKE WTFH"
I love how extra is Eugene
OMG I knew Eugene would be extra af!
Keith looks like a dude you just want to pat on the the head when he just finished a test about the most random stuff Ned would think about.
i can wear heels and i'm fine for like 3 hours after that it hurts i war 4-5-6  inch heels
Im getting leafy on this
I feel extra bad for Eugene bc his heels look like they're too big and lord knows it's twice as difficult to walk in heels that don't fit, especially when they're that crazy!!!
I think try guys should try driving manual shifts for a week.
"You pop on 4 inches, how am I supposed to complete with that"
Me (when the guys say they can't walk and when Eugene complains about the daggers that are six inches): BOYS, MOVE OVER!!! When I was a child people asked if I wanted to look good or be fast. I went be catwomam. Now I CAN SPRINT IN NINE INCH HEELS AND FEEL NO PAIN!!!!!
All I could think about while watching this was Bongyoung.. dancing.. in.. heels.. how did he do it.
Eugene reminded me of tye guy who danced to Wiggle in high heels
of course Eugene out does everyone. He outheeled and outdanced them! XD
4 inch heels all day isn't bad. (I was wearing Doc Martains)
Why tf does Eugene look fabulous in everything?
Eugene is my Queen
All I kept thinking about was Prince. That man makes heels look DELICIOUS. Good job trying, guys lol.
9:18-9:19 was that shangela and laganja?
So is Ned gonna start wearing heels more, because he looked good in them (and he actually made sensible heel decisions)
Zach, the only one with any sense. If you're wearing heels, low boots are the best way to go.
If you're ever driving and you see four men walking across the road it's either drag queens...or the try guys
high heel were made for men actually haha
I hate heels but I love flat heels, you know the sandals with high flat heel? Idk 😅
I think it's cool how the shoes represent  them like Eugene always looks the most fierce
Oh, Zach... you are so adorable I CAN'T HANDLE IT ❤❤❤
My rule is you're married to your heels once you leave the house. Divorce only happens when you return home 😅
but of course eugene still rocks it 😂😂😂 and zack got lucky with the booties, prolly the easiest to wear.
zach is the only smart one
I didn't know I needed this 😂
so I can never understand why people say it hurts
is it weird that whenever I were 👠 they never hurt even if I were it for 2 hours
I want to marry Eugene so hard. He can wear the heels, too.
Zach chose the easiest heels, but he also looked the best in then so... shrug
Why are these people acting like heels are horribly painful? They're not that bad.
the blond wife looks like the main character from the shannara chronicles!😱
" You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels " 
Actually laughing so hard lmaoooo
Is Eugene gay?
0:50 those don't look bad at all on him
Oh my lord they all look so good in heels 😂👌🏼 and I'm a wanna be drag qween 😬 looks so rewarding 😂
I heard heels originally made for men..i can see that working especially with zachs booties. not bad ....
PLZ TELL ME ZACH WILL BE WEARING MORE CUTE HEELS IN FUTURE VIDEOS
Zach had it soooooooooo easy
I thought the gauntlet was cancelled because Steve killed all his campers?
I hate heels so much because they give you so many health problems, not just to your feet but to your whole body.
To all the panic at the disco fans out there: I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but I make these high heels work!
When Eugene was dancing I was like "MAKE HIM STOP,END MY SUFFERING"  XD
I want a man like this
6:11 lol 😂
6 inches is more than people think XD
six inch heeeeeeeels
he walked in the club like nobody's busineeeess
I have to survive 8 hours of work on high heels.
Who was the girl Eugune was dancing with
Eugene:"They will motherf***ing kill you"
Me:"true, very true."
Remember heels were originally designed for men.
the longest I have ever been in heels was from 7p.m till 8a.m 
once I took them off it felt as if I had 1000 needles in my feet, every step hurt like a mofo
from where are these shoes?
my feet can feel the blisters from those strappy shoes and my ankles are dying just looking at Eugene walk
weak.
Zach and I have the same taste in shoes.
i rewatched this video just to see eugene dance
So relatable guys! Love you. And Eugene, does are some crazy-ly hot dance moves! Bravo! And you were so hot on heels ;P
"you got two entrées?"
"I was hungry"
"You cant tell me what to eat when im wearing heels"
I want this on my tombstone
YAS EUGENE QUEENNNNNN
Eugene would be such a good drag queen 😂❤️
zack wore the most comfortable heel EVER!! 
i would like to see keith in eugene's 6 inch heel hahaha
Eugene is sexy as f*ck!!! I would hit it for sure! Haha especially with him looking like a total bro in that hat
girls have it sooooo much harder then boys.. and if your a boy and you tell me I'm wrong... I will stab you with my heels 😂😏
when he threw those shoes in the dumpster I almost had a panic attack!
"Nope not wasted, just wearing heels" is actually my life motto as a short, clumsy human.
omg I frickin love walking in dagger stilettos
"THE DAGGER STRIKES" is my superhero line now.
I ONLY live in heels lol
This is wonderful
EUGENE THE STRIPPER
Of course Eugene wore dagger heals lol
can we appreciate how comfortable the try guys are with their masculinity
i loved eugenes and zachs shoes. they really matched their outfits
Only here because of a Yuri on Ice edit of this video
Wow. Eugene has talent,
i wanna be eugene when i grow up
2:46 PUPPY
They make it look so easy...
eugene is me while dancing😂😂😂😂
did they lose a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt? because they make those high heels work
So acting gay has really taken off in the US.
lol I take mine off for a minute and wear flats XD
Eugene motherfuckin danced!
Eugene could give me herpes and I would thank him
It's all about the heel you get. They can look good and still be comfy.
Just a continuation of Eugene having to one up everyone😂😂
its risegum
when ur seriously out of an idea for a video...
The only thing i can think of is:
"I lost a bet to a guy in chiffon skirt, but i make these high heels work!"
Zach actually looks good
sees ankle boots heels

Me: whispers Prince.
men in high heels are hot
I'm Eugene..... and Ned
the try guys should go on the fastest rollercoasters🎢
I was once wearing high heels at the mall, but I got a blister on my heel so I had to walk with my friends barefooted lmao
this is me every time i go out even though i never wear heels because i have scoliosis so the pain is there when the heels arent
May your feet rest in peace
This is why i wear flats, slippers or sneakers to the club.
I can't even wear 4 inches stilettos I feel like a failure compared to Eugene
7:57 I wish that rolls royce would hit me...
I got this app called hellopet and it was standing on Eugene Keith Ned and Zach
my fiance painted me t-nails
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work  - Brendon  urie
What a discovery, wow.
Zac was smart and wore boots
Can someone please tell zach about shoe inserts that make men look taller, I feel like he would really like those
That face that Keith made. "Sittin's great" :3
Eugene slays all day 😂
Eugene dancing with that girl was highkey sexy as hell
I was way too excited about Ariel.
2 best feelings in the world are, taking off your bra, and taking off your heels after a night out
"Whose that man walking down the street with those delicate feet, it's Zack!" XD
8:05 a stripper?????
Zach is so Hot wearing his Ankle Heals
Best thumbnail
I swear Eugene can pull off anything
thats so gay
Salam alaikoum. I hope you support me in my channel. I am a Moroccan girl writing poetry
hahahaha i love that Eugene goes all out
this channel is pathetic
"my heels for tonight are actually called dagger pumps, because the heel is so tall, they'll motherfuckin' kill you.
I would like to report that on your snapchat thingy that todays post about Disney was weid because that you wrote a dog walking a dog but i would like to inform you that Goofy is not a dog but Pluto to is so you information is incorrect !
CAn we get a full video of Eugene dancing in bars
So when I was challenged to dance... I motherfuckin danced. 👢


Can I get that on a poster for my room please? Please?
Poor Eugene. 😂
'Who's your spirit animal?'
'Ned from Buzzfeed'
literally everyone i know wears trainers when they go out haha but props to them for giving it a go!!
honestly zach should wear boot heels all the time he looked really good 🔥🔥
eugene is great on heels
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt.
But I make these high heels work!
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
eugene's heels remind me of violet chachki.
"The Stilletos are so tall, they'll *** Kill you" lol His face XD
next one -  The Try Guys try bugchasing.
I hate high heels so very much.
Eugene, the queen of fashion
Zach and Eugene looks SO HOT
I give Eugene mad props. Yass queen lol
i ship zach and eugene so hard you don't even know
Zack's choice was the best
dude tho eugene was doing it with THOSE SHOES /and/ too big for him, i'm impressed
They *look* good..... but they are only practical for about 10 minutes. I never wear anything over 5cms high. They hurt otherwise!
according to the English dictionary, High Heels = the opposite of Ultra Boost.
I'm sorry maybe not, Because Ultra Boost are both comfortable and good looking, my bad.
You see, if you wear heels to the club. You have to get drunk! that way you don't feel your feet when you're dancing.
I don't admit it usually but i really like men in heels.
lol eugene rocks every challenge
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD
Face plant 😂
ZACK WHY DID YOU FLAT OUT YOU HAD COMFOTABLE SHOES
they dont know how to walk in heels 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lol Zack has the best shoes for a night out because they aren't stilettos.
DAMNNNN EUGENE U GO BOI!! But srsly Eugene was poppin😆👌💧
"That tush has gOT THE PUSH" Keith you're killing me!!
I bet Eugene wanted to take that girl home but because he is competitive he said goodbye
All thing aside, props to Eugene for using double the heel height of everyone else
Coz 5" without platform is usually the top of the line, and even then not a lot of girls use that
Zack--ankle boots?? Come on! You're supposed to get the full high heel experience! You totally wussed out. Ankle boots don't count. Eugene was the clear winner.
Zach and Eugene looked so good jfc
They wear high heels better than I do.
OKAY, zack looked great
2:31-2:33 Omg.
Eugene is fabulous.
When guys wears heels better than you..
Haha..
I love Eugene
ARIEL IS SO CUTE !!
I'm turning 12 and I ware 4 inch high heels to school and ware them all day even when I play tag at lunch (never do) anyway these girls should be able to last at least 7,8 hours in heels 👠
of course Eugene gotta be extra and get bigger ones than everyone else.
see Zach was the smartest I always wear closed toe chunky heels because they are so much more comfortable
"Who's that man walking down the street with those delicate feet, it Zach " I giggled
"there's a lot of uneven terrain" the motherfuckin struggle, i feel you on another level
The heels look best on Eugene(holyschmokes) and Zach.
these guys are whimps I'm a part time drag queen like I've worn dagger heels from 5am to 8pm  and I'm fat as hell but I rock it
If you follow me on Instagram k_c__lynch I will sub to your channel
the hot asian guy looks great in heels
Next Up;The Try Guys try waterboarding!
Prince was one of the few men who rocked them heels and still got any girl
lmao i wear 4 inch heels to school every single day and everyone always asks "oh my god dont ur feet hurt???" and i say no because my feet have become numb to the pain
ned = charlie price
Zach looked SO good with those ankle boots
This is cringeworthy, 200%
is silently able to wear heels 8+ hours normally and still is able to party.
I'm 6 foot tall, if I even attempt to wear heels I look like a man in bad drag.
Eugene took the saying "go big or go home" too literally lol.
Zach and Keith: 3 inches=kind of bad
Ned: 4 inches=ouch end the pain
Eugene:6 inches=HOLY MOTHER OF-
when our got heels that boots got push😂
3.75" heels is the maximum for me. if i'm paying money for heels, i better be able to wear them all day without wanting to kill myself or others.
eugene MAKES HEELS LOOK BETTER HOW?????????
I would just like to say this is way harder when your feet are like 6 inches long to begin with
Eugene manages to make even heals hot. and i struggle to pull off a belt.
I love how Ned just chucked his heels into the dumpster
"I'm a forward thinking man, I'm responsible. So I'm gonna get drunk." -Zack
Heels for me are not painful at all.Maybe cause I can't fit them XD
This is why Prince died.
zachs outfit was really cute i would wear the whole thing and he should wear it more often
noob
ZACH LOOKS SO GOOD THO
Eugene Got Tooooo Comfortable Lmaoo
I like zacks shoes
ok but Zach looks really cute in those boots
could never be me XDDDDDDDDDD
I wore open toed shoes one time on my bus, and my feet accidentally got rolled over by a rolling backpack.
Poor Keith and Ned!
Eugene is fine!! Zack....I love him!!!
Of course Eugene would pick those heels  😂 😂 😂
Don't women know that high heals are a choice?
Those boots are so not even heels lol. They're easy af to walk in.
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
you think that's pain? Im a size 9 and the only thing (for a choir concert) that was wear-able (somehow?) was a size 4...and they were heels!
Eugene dancing gave me life
😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️zac
oooohhh the pain!
Zach got so lucky
I knew Eugene would be in this vid

And he would go big
This is my favourite Try Guys video EVeR
I feel like Eugene could rock heels.
And that's  why I always wear crocs
When your low key wondering how RDJ managed in heels for almost every MARVEL Movie
they should try japanese fashion
zach had the best shoes to wear lol comfortable and stylish
eugene dancing was goals
8:04 ope, um . strip club alert
Zach and Eugene actually pulled the heels off really well and stayed almost until 2 while Eugene was wearing daggers the other two quit and theirs werent even that high. Also Zach SLAAYYYED those boots tho.
Zach: "Only the hot ones are left"
Me: *Agrees
Keith is such a babe honestly
In Argentina platforms are really popular whether they are high or low, and you can totally dance from 23 to 6 am
Can I have Zacks shoes?? ❤️🙏
These girls are mean. They didn't tell the boys to get thick soles to cushion the blow
4:21 
TWO OF HEARTS! TWO HEARTS THAT BEAT AS ONE!
I LOVE THAT SONG!
SOFT AND NEAT
OH MY GOD EUGENE DANCING IS AMAZING IM DYING
Eugene is such a great actor. He doesn't have any problems walking with heels as Kimora Blac in RuPaul's Drag Race. I see you dude.
Mmmh, Eugene
They lost a beg to a guy in a chiffon skirt. But they make those high heels work 😉
They wear heels better than me.
Now the try guys know how the women's and girl feel with heel.👠👡👢👣😏and I'm just only 9
god Eugene. I love you.
Why do women do this to themselves on a daily basis?  #Fuckthepatriarchy
6:23 I SHIP IT ! 😂😂😂😂
I have the same boots Zack wore lol
How do you make your mom proud
Me "Get into a good college and keep a great career"
Eugene "Where dagger heels"
ARE SOME OF THE GUYS WEARING TYPE 1 DIABETIC PUMPS??????!!!!!! I'M TYPE 1 ALSO!!!!!!!
That moment when Eugene looks better in high heels than you.
I LOVE Eugene so much , he slayed in those heels!
my feet hurt
Eugene is wildin
i'm here trying to ignore the fact that Eugene walks in heels better than i do lol
Ned's wife CAN GET IT.
And drunk Eugene dancing was LIFE, it was incredible! 😍😍
i would marry Zack
I was beat by a guy in a chaffron skirt but I make these high heels work
They are hotter than I am with heels and I am a girl...WOOOW
Zach's shoes actually went with his outfit! LOVED IT. I would wear EVERYTHING he had on.
heels are hell  lol
I have an ankle problem that makes it so I can't wear heels. Part of me is sad, because my fiance is 6'3 and I'm 5'1, and part of me is 100% okay with not being able to wear heels
06:43 are they at a male strip club? lol
Zach's zippers being on the outside bugged me
if zach wouldve gotten hit, atleast it wouldve been by a rolls royce
Eugene is the only one who actually wore great heals
Try Guys vs LadyLike 🤷🏼‍♀️
Lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt,
But I make these high heels work
"Partying with the Try Guys" is definitely on my bucket list!
So why would girls like to wear high heels? A lot of girls complain about their lives on heels, if you hate it just don't wear it.
Up next: Try guys do Pointe Shoes 💁🏼
the fact that eugene walks in heels better than i do
soft and neat
Uhh when uegen danced sry if spelt wrong that was a stranger and look at his dance moves ;-;
(•—•)
Uegene wtf did u did (•—•
Eugene said motherfuck so many times in this video.
When I was 8, my mom bought me 1 inch heels. I loved  them but when we had parties I couldn't run around with my cousins. I still have them.
little tip boys and girls: Shoulders Back and Hips Out. Also the higher the heel the more hip swaying needed to stay balanced
i want zachs.. those are so much better
heey, yes, you, who is reading this. i have a question, i am dutch so that makes me??
 ⬇let me know
미쳤넼ㅋㅋ 유진이 신은 신발 조녜...
You have to say though they have nice asses lol 😂👍🏻
Zach-2017'add on 4 extra inches and I can't compete with that.'
Zac cheated with those ankle boots
zach's shoes actually look good with his outfit
I seriously wish guys would wear heels more often. They look feckin incredible!!
Eugene had to put up with the most pain
its official, im in love with eugene
most of the boy's i know are shorter than me and if they stand next to me i feel tall (I'm 1.83 cm) sometime i hate my life
EUGENE WAS SLAAAAAAYING
I love Zack's boots! I would totally wear them!
ned slimmed down?
get bofferlow show instead... :-P
i think the are all gay
y'all need some platforms.
I actually love men wearing heels, it makes them look more fearless than they are .
I'm from Glasgow and if you take off your heels you can get stopped by the police because when you carry them they are classed as a weapon, glasgows a friendly place
High heels are just bad for your feet and knees.
All this talk about 6 inches
I'm pretty sure Eugene's shoes were too big, you could see a huge gap between his heel and the back of the shoe
0:16 don't 😂😂
So funny you guys.
Zach looked good in those shoes
Anyone else notice the car he was almost hit by was a rolls Royce?
Eugene is trying to break his ankles. I swear!
When Eugene starts dancing with that girl😂 it's like, he dances better than me when I'm wearing flats🤣
eugene has high heels and still pick up a girl respect
in sweden we have like our own mcdonalds and it is called MAX maybe they should try it
Eugene was the unluickeis
Zach was the luckiest
Someone Is Here to reply me?
😂😂😂
I wouldn't have lasted as long as Eugene tbh
The try guys go emo for a day
I wanna see more of Eugene dancing with those heals XD
other guys would so think that you are gay!
When zach did dropped in the beginning I died 😂😂😂😂
fun fact high heels ere made for men. butchers particularly, were made so they didnt step in blood.
Try guys try figure skating
Everyone here is sad that all the try guys look better in heels than you will ever
Eugene makes everything hot🔥
for some reason i think heels r super easy to walk in. and zacks heels r really easy to walk in
#sosexy
I've been Eugene in this video more times than I care to admit...
LOL I could not stop laughing
"My fiancé painted my 'tnails'"
Did you know that when heels were made they were actually made for men
okay where do i find zach's boots
I love Eugene lmao
Super proud of Eugene for lasting that long in six-inch heels 😂
This video just seeing their hairy legs & their big feet wearing heels 🤣😂🤣😂
I wanna dance with Eugene ❤❤❤
who else was completely dying of laughter 6:23 😂😂😂
Heels were originally made for men lol
Eugene looked beautiful in heels
I have a problem but I look hot Lol
Only Eugene would  wear  those 😂😂
i could wear heals for 12 hours straight
Shoutout to Zach for being the only one who picked sensible heels. Idk what TF the rest of them were thinking.
Zach was definitely the most sensible with shoe choice
tbh they look cute
but i MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK only few know
It's not a vid without Ned asking, "but don't they make my butt look good?"
Can we just appreciate how the biggest problem these guys faced was the pain involved in wearing heels and not, like, the "emasculation" of them wearing heels (in public, no less) ! ♥
"My toes are bleeding...but I look hot"
bet they lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt but they made those high heels work like beebo
Becky's looking very fine with all that smile! Perfect for Keith! Katie looks as if she wants to laugh at them really hard! I don't feel left out anymore! But... Ariel! Look at her stare! If ned gets hit by a car, she'll sense it fast and get in her car and carry him to the hospital when behind her, there's explosions! This should be a movie! It should be named, "Ariel, Part of Her World!"
1:44 BRROOOOOOOMAANCE
Heels have been my bane since becoming a model! People always ask, "How do you walk so well in heels!?". Literal training, and behind the scenes crying.
I like how when they put the heels on they automatically assume "the position"
Eugene 😏
Eugene 😏
It baffles me that people will willingly wear somethin' when they suffer as a result.
I love you Eugine
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
i love zach's shoes
I can run comfortably in 4in heels
I'm 13
is that weird?🤔


nah! I'm just a boss😎
I like the daggers😂😂😂😂😂
I love high heels but I have probablies with my ankles so when I put them on I can't walk so I'm sad cuz of that
"But I look hot" LOLOLOLLOLOLOLO
6:30   I'm dying 😆
Tuhnails
LOLLLLLLLLLL
When Ned and Keith threw those heels in the dumpster I freaked out for like 5 seconds because that sh*t ain't cheap!, but then Keith said: "We should grab those shoes tho, they were expensive" and I felt sooooo relieved😂
Asian guy yes you are hit in heels
So if Eugene was a girl he would were these in every outfit
2:29 DAMN
Eugene can dance so sexy my god YAS Eugene YAS
6 inches deym I only wear 3-5 inches heels
You can't tell me what to eat when I'm eating heels
Zach's look is so good with the boots
Eugene owned those heels. he was looking like a god damn diva when he entered that room! lol I love it.
At 5:48 you can see the lady dancing on the pole THERE AT A STRIP CLUB!
"Don't" 
😂😂
Is Keith getting married???!!!
"The stiletto is so tall, they'll motherfucking kill you" sounds like a play I was in called Homicide in Heels, I was the murderer and got to stab people with my heels
yaaas
This generation is fucked...
why eugene is so hot, i don't get how he can slay always like oh my gad boi
Do a video of 35 uses of lube
The Try Guys must inhale helium
i worn high heels since i was 4 ;D
I would only wear highheels for a photoshooting or maybe for a visit at a restaurant and nowhere else, they just hurt sooo much - Real torture devices, spot on! 👠
why did this remind me of Brendon Urie from PATD!
i wish someone had like, taught them how to walk in heels tho, that was almost painful to watch
i love how their in a strip club 😂😂😂
Oh my gooooood, that buttdrop!!!! Eugene slays it every single Time!!!! 😱😱😱😆😆😆😍😍😍
"I've never had a buckle so tiny" 😂
Kind of dig Eugene's heels
Zach was smart to wear the boots
Eugene just rocks everything! So unfair! 😂❤️
welcome to our world ...our world of pain
Entertaining when High heels were originally created for men in royalty.
Zachs boots... Like, Harry styles would wear those
So, Buzzfeed get males to try on 'stereotypically' girl items of clothing and its funny.
But when they get girls to try 'stereotypically' boy items of clothing, NO THAT IS NOT OK, WHY ARE YOU ASSUMING THAT ONLY MEN CAN WEAR THAT U SEXIST PERSON!!!
Feminists..
Eugene Danced Like Crazy ;o; xD
3" heels are not "kitten" heels...Kitten heels are under 2".Zach was definitely the most sensible one. But damn those dagger heels did nice things for Eugene's backside. Fashion and function. T-T Why can't they get along?
Eugene is the definition of extra
I love how Keith's fiancee is just so accepting of every weird thing he does. Keith decides to wear heals, she paints his toe nails.
Omg I love Eugene ❤
THIS is why I am wearing Toms to my wedding! Comfort over style any day!
Welll...... heels were originally made for men sooooo... who cares
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SHIRT, BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORKK. (This was directed to Eugene, k)
"I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt. But I make these high heels work." No? Just me?
Damn... Eugene making those high heels work
I love how Eugene is wearing a shirt with their names on it 😂
I would date Zach tbh
"Fuckin people!"-Zack
I am 19 years old girl and I have never wear high heels because I am soo scared
I swear Ned should teach all males a lesson "you can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels"
once i wore my moms heels i nearly feel down the stairs it was not FUN
me when i wake up in the morning and im still tired but i have to go to school and eeryone is there awake and chatting and im like- 8:02
I keep laughing during the video, anyway,  I wonder why they don't use bikini then walking on the street with high heels , it is defenitely hillarious
I'm loving Zach's and Ned's shoes but Eugene. As soon as I saw the length of those heels, I could already feel the pain in my legs.
If you can only see around four toes in those heels then where does the number seven come from lol
Fack Bazzfud i fackung Hiet bazzfieud
instead of saying toe nails keith said tanails
Zach looks REALLY good in heels. I think he should wear them more often.
I am here for Eugene finally, FINALLY, not being good at something
'Pop on four extra inches and guess what, I can compete with that'
Same boo.. Same..
But I can also pop on five inch heels and slay😊
(I'm pretty short... Sporting 5'3)
My goal in life is to drunk dance with Eugene at some point
Their shoes totally match their personality. ^^
The feeling that in heels u wanna impress people more  . ... Yeap!! that is right🙄👠👠
Zacks heels were cute
~try guys try horse riding 
~try guys mind puppies for a week 
~try guys try periods
"What advice do you have for us?"
"Don't."
PERFECT
Now, Guys respect women wearing high heels.
I badly want Eugene's "Keith & Ned & Zach & Eugene" t shirt!
Who else heard an Orange Caramel song in there??
only eugene would do that to himself though
Ok ankle boots are nothing compared to what the others got 😂😂
ofc Eugene got dagger heels
Zack slayed in heels. He actually is hot af
If my friends wore these he'd make a hole on the floor
I wanna see them in platform stilettos
The fact Ned's wife took him to a strip club is amazing.
I love that whenever anyone puts on high heels, their inner divas come out 😂 Regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality etc. they all turn into the sassiest divas ever when they strap themselves up in the shoes and it's amazing~
Of course, Eugene had to get the hardest heel to wear; yet still slays it better than most people I know :)
Damn yougen
I kinda wanna see the Try Guys wear booty shorts for a week xD
Eugene: *drops*
Me: Well sweet mother of god I promised not to fall for another guy
Lucky for Eugene he only got bleeding is his right foot while mine was a hurting and bleeding nose on the left I did not pick my nose on that time
im smart I wear wedges so its fashionable and comfortable... but I also have heels and they are comfortable maybe because I walk on my toes all the time???
I have the EXACT nail varnish Keith was wearing on his toes.
Eugene 😍
Dont worry Ned i can relate to the chair thing
Eugene is SO HOT
Of course Keith would pick the Highest heels
i think eugene won at this bcuz look at the freakin highheels even though zach lasted the longest
Zach's shoes don't even count as high heels
Damn Eugene, you don't wear your sit and look pretty heels out on the town. That's rule #1 dawg
6 inch heals are for going to dinner and that's it lol
Comfortable, lower heels are for walking from bad to bar and dancing 

Last week I went out and my friend let me wear a pair of her heels, they were about 3 or 4 inches tall, which isn't very high for me, but they weren't my size. We walked to get a taxi, about a block away and I was already having trouble. Long story short, I got giant blisters on the bottom of my feet and big toes, that still haven't healed up and I got an infection because one popped. Size matters 😭
demonitize buzzfeed
I feel like Zach actually looked good in his.
ZACK LOOKED SO GOOD THO
the damn cane 😂😂😂
I'm with Eugene; im wearing 6 inches heels all night xD
I wonder how many times Eugene got catcalled
LOL! That's right! When i'm wearing heals i don't want to hear lip about what i'm eating^^
Oh come on, Zac's heels were nothing.
they should try the hole look like the make up, the outfit, the heels, and the breasts to try it all and they should do there own makeup
I love u buzz feed
"Somebody bumped into me and stepped on MY TOE" lmaoo
eugene's dancing 😂😂😂
Did anyone else get a chill down their spine at the sight of the six-inch heels?
Zach's heels is much easier to wear than the other try guys and eugene has the hardest to wear
Eugene!!! <3
I love how meanwhile the guys on the choker video were so embarrassed by it, these guys are rocking these heels without a care in the world
Eugene really was the real winner considering he had the highest heels. One had a boot heel and the others had kitten heels those are nothing compared to high stilettos
Who is that other girl in the vid there's Ned's wife and Keith's girlfriend who's the other one??
" I usually don't fall when I stand."
- don't threaten me with a good time
Puts the meaning in it.
I find taking the heels off after an hour or two super satisfying. Also I can run in heels. That's cool. My feet hurt though.
Is it weird that I high-key want man heels to be a thing? It's sexy.
yo, i wanna see one of the other try guys live with ned's wife for a week.
but why does Zach look really trendy
Mozarts Requiem was a nice touch at that part with the dagger ones
ZACH, WHERE DID YOU BUY YOUR BOOTS. I WANT THEM.
buzzfeed, more like cuck feed. every try guys episode is like, how can we emasculate these cucks even more???
I really wish you'd make a video trying out the VOCALOID Software
He is sexy in those  dagger pumps...
Eugene dancing is all I needed
Somebody give Zak the timberland heels i think hed like them
Kieth (snap snap) HAAANDSOMME
I love this 😂
lol. I haven't worn heels in a year. and that was for my bffs wedding. for like a day.
Wait... Eugene doesn't like Christmas???
"You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels"
-Ned, 2017
Eugene lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But he make those high heels work
Zach's outfit with those heels were GREAT
She's beauty, she's grace, she's Eugene
is it just me or do they look like dogs when they have socks on when they walk 😂
I'm a guy and when I wear heals I'm much more of a Eugene, surprisingly graceful. (Btw Eugene, your weak. I only have 6in heals, grow some callouses)
"Nope, not wasted,
Just wearing heels."
I wore heels to homecoming and broke my foot
if you're going to go 6 inch you go platform and chunky heel
love that mic pack @ 2:36
8:00, yup that's a phantom
did you know that heels were originally made for men riding horses?
"Not wasted, just wearing heels." XD
Everybody looks good in high heels
😂😂😂 I need my guy friends to do this so they stop telling me I'm not a normal girl for not wearing these torture devices!!!
Eugene is the hottest ever and slays me in every video .. the dagger heels have me SNATCHED
Zach was super cute here??? He's always cute but those shoes really complemented his look in a way I didn't expect.
The shoes matched their personalities
I would wear Zach's heels beside not the other guys
its good enough that they did not put THE TRY GUYS on youtube red
I love these guys😍😂🙌🏽
I love the boots.
For some reason their legs look really skinny?!
EUGENE DROPPIN IT LIKE ITS HOOOOOOOTTT! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👅💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦 life.
What a day
Can the try guys try volleyball??
KIETH'S FIANCE!!!
Yay! I was afraid Try Guys was over! Glad to see more of you!
What type of jacket is Zach wearing?
I want Zack' s shoes
the only heels that I wear on a normal basis is 2 inch heel for Irish dance every week :P
zac is me at 5;37 with my friends
Am I the only one who saw that Eugene kiss Ned at 6:41
Ned and Eugene look so hot in heels.
What I'm I doing with my time
i fell off the bus stairs once because i was wearing heels and i didn't have the hands to grab onto the rails
How could Eugene choose anything other than something called Dagger Pumps
I can run, jump, dance, practically do anything in 3" or so heels, but any longer and I'll be like a flopping fish on the ground
I couldn't breath this is priceless
Men should wear heel! They're slaying it!
“someone bumped into me and stepped on my TOE” lmao
Leave it to eugene to pick 6 inch dagger pumps
Know the pain! I can run in heels and I don't have a problem. Might have sore feet later but it's fine then.
hahahahahah I love you guys
I hate taking my heals off.
Always thought Eugene was gay
oh god Eugene
Eugenes dancing is so beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍
When Eugene did that squat dance thing everyone was 😲😲😲😲😲😲
5:43-5:44 NED DROPS HIS WEAPON.😂
how do people think this is hard heels are easier to walk in then normal shoes
2:31- 2:32 Eugene DROPS HIS WEAPON 😂
There's Zach in boot heels...and Eugene in dagger pumps...I find that funny😂
Keith's toes look better than mine. Damn.
Zach at 1:00-1:01... DROP YOUR WEAPON.😂
2:00 Actual representation of me wearing heels and I'm a woman.
It isnt letting m with he yputube red thing
Welp that was a rolls royce, shoulda let em hit you 💵💵💵
Ankle boots are most comfortable
Ankle boots are like safer
Anyone else think Eugene is like totally gay
Those feet turned me on, wow
omg the try guys have to try stilleto nail acrylics
From the neck down Zach straight up looks like Harry Styles with those boots.
I would wear everyone of them shoes
I'm all for Zach embracing male heels, do it dude! you looked great
"I may have made a terrible mistake, but I look hot."  Every female to ever wears heels.
Eugene... Honey... I can't even watch you do this to yourself...
Omg mad respect to Eugene
Eugene looks hot in heels. I mean Eugene always looks hot but he looks amaaaazing in heels.
I think that Zachs heels were the most normal
Brendon urie should have been in this video
Eugene is tge sassiest omg
Love the try guys! 😁 this was do much fun, I personally don't use high heels because it makes r feel insecure, I'm almost 6' not trying to be taller!
I love the try guys 😹😹😹💜💜
UGIN YOU DON'T LIKE CHRISTMAS
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK. fandom were ya at
After my high school graduation, I couldn't feel a spot on the soles of my feet for a month and a half. For my University graduation, I wore flats.
okay i need eugenes shirt
ok if Eugene fell backwards and his foot went up he would take out an eye
"But I make these high heels work"
UGH. Zach. date me. 

That is all.
"I motherf*cker dance."
-Eugene 2017 
😂😂😂😂
My friend from school, he wears heels every Wednesday 😂
i hate buzzfeed but try guys are my guilty pleasure
Eugene scares me so much. Because my mom is a model and she can't even make it one night in those heel's.
Well, they should try gender switch next time
Keithe's fiancee is beautiful af o.o
Eugene is hot af
"My feet are on the dirty ground but I dont caaaare!" I've been there many times xD
Eugene : when I get told to dance . . .  I Dance 

😂😂😂
I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but I make these high heels work!
just one word. sasssssyyyy
V f
Omg one time me and my friend were walking around in four inches and she made me run the rest of the way home
oh god eugene chose the worst heels to wear lol
That guy who stepped on Ned was mean and he said "Welcome to the real world" and catcalled
Eugene is so tall but +6In!
Eugene is so weird in heels.
I hate heels but I like Zach how he chose Ankle Boots
IF i get 1k likes i Will do IT and upload to youtube!!!
Buzzfuck
Anyone else loved how serious Eugen was when he said"and I motherfuckin danced
Keith is me. "You're walking so slow!"
2:13

- so that's the kind of shoes Sebastian [black butler] wears? xD
Anyone else think Zack reminded them  of Andrew Lowe with his jeans and the boots
They make these high heels work
Try Guys should try Bollywood  Dancing!!!
Try pointe shoes 😂😂
my feet are sore just watching this
Zack just looks like he's in Harry Styles shoes for a night and tbh he can pull it off
"When I was challenged to dance , I'm motherfuckin danced"
eugene always looks hot no matter what he does.dammmit!
Y'all shoulda just worn stripper heels. You get the height, the pizzaz, and the comfort 😂
Eugene is usually the best
"Cat called"
"Where would I wear these? I wouldnt."
I'm a guy and I would try this
did they really go to a strip club?
Eugene can walk better in those stilettos than I can in regular shoes.
I hate heels and Im a woman
can try guys try nail extensions for a week and do day to day  challenges please :)
We're they at a gay but?
Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Zack!
I saw the girl stripping in the club XD
i wear zach style heels almost every day. i dont even count them as heels. theyre so comfortable
Eugene is a gift.
Keith must have an amazing wife if she paints Keith's toe-nails.
oh my god its so sexy
Zac longbottomed by 3 inches
What video do the Try Guys do drag in? They are brave, I'm a woman and I never wear heels. The closest I get is to wear cowboy boots that are 2 inches lol.
I am so happy that I can't wear highheels XD
Hey Zac, I'm a size 11 Those boots are cute, let me take them off your hands.
Removing your heels is sometimes better than sex
I think it's funny how the guy with the glasses (sorry I don't know his name) felt more confident wearing heels cause he looked taller, when I'm over here trying to get smaller cause I'm 5'9 or 175 cm tall and I'm 12 years old 😂
I would where the boots and the silver ones
*Starts playing don't threaten me with a good time*
i lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt
but i make these high heels work
네드 겁나 인실 당함ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
i felt like zach wore the boots on the wrong feet, aren't the zippers meant to be on the inside?
Zack definitely looked the best.
Bartender pulls away Ned's drinks
Bartender: No sir you can't have more, you're drunk.
Ned: No I'm not drunk, I fell down because of my heels!
Bartender:
Bartender: That's why you can't drink any more sir
Damn Eugene 😳
I need to know if some of my fave drag queens watch this show
I reckon they lost a bet to a man in a chiffon skirt, but they make these high heels WORK
😂 who grinding on my man omg.
I used to wear 6inch heels all day and then I would go home put on a different pair of 6inch heels and go dancing until a little after midnight and then drive home still in my heels. weak game boys weak game. though I do note that Eugen's heels do not fit they're to long there's a large gap between his heel and the show and after seeing his toes they're clearly not wide enough.
Ned looks fantastic.
Eugene is way to good at 'getting down'
Hey Try Guys you should try peyote cactus
I love this show
Idc Who's Wearing Them . As Long As You Know How To Walk In Them Lol
Haha! Guys wearing high heels?! How super duper GAY and UNMANLY!
Of course Eugene has to slay the day with 6 in stilettos
Here's a thought..

Don't wear heels
hahahaha. I'm 5'8". I'll never have to wear high heels. huehuehuehuehue
I would love to see them go out in drag for a night
I hate smaller heels so Eugene's stilettos are closest to the majority of my closet.
Eugene SLAYS MY LIFE. YES QUEEN
heels really ain't no joke like omg partying takes alot out of feet. I'm now just going in high heel sneakers instead it's better
Ned's tacos came with mashed potatoes.....
I hate how they say wearing heels is hard and it hurts after 3 hours try wearing pointe shoes for 3 minutes
is it just me or is Zac's receding hair line less... receded?
But like, where did Zack get his shoes?
My thought through the whole video

I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt but I make these high heels work-
Brendon Urie
How the hell did Keith score a hot babe?
I think the Try Guys need to leave BuzzFeed and make there own channel like Safiya Nygaard. These guys are the only reason that I sometimes watch buzzfeed but only because of them :)
Now I want to wear these heels thank you Eugene!
How Keith got his toenails painted 😂😂😂😂😂
Zacks heels are super cute
Isn't giving the name 'dagger' to a stiletto kind of redundant?
Ned, and his 2 entrees 😂😂
ya'll need to watch 1M dance studio's choreographer Bongyoung dancing wiggle in stilletos 😂
They should do the try guys try lacrosse, I'd like to see if they could even cradle the ball
I don't care what anyone says Eugene totally won Zack got off so easy
Hey, fellow men who were cursed with being short! There is something called 'Elevator shoes', which are basically platform shoes for men that are built to look like normal shoes. They make them for women too if you don't want to wear platforms or heels!
When you can run in heels and didn't know it was supposed to be hard
and what happened to eugene and ryan on the soffa?
None of them could walk in heels well to begin with! You have to swing your hips it makes it soooo much easier!!
Zach looks great
say what now lady*eugene* did you say m*********er
I'm a girl and I DON'T LIKE HEELS, like when it's a party or a fancy event.. I DONT WEAR IT, I wear something else that is elegant and cute.. and I DON'T CARE!!! IT HURTS!! and I won't stand hurt in every step I make just for looking nice... blah!! If you like me you will ask me to dance in my comfy shoes
Omfg Eugene looks so hot im sweating
"Six inches is a lot to ask of someone's feet" I am a dancer and I literally stand on 1 inch of platform and have all of my weight on 2 toes. You guys should try that. Try standing with your feet vertical. Not only stand but walk around and turn while looking perfectly graceful!
Zach's heels were probably ones I would actually wear :)
Not gonna lie Ned looks like he has Rickets or he pooped his pants and is trying to get to the toilet
WHY DOES EUGENE ALWAYS LOOK SO GOOD!? 😂😂😂😂
I'm pretty sure if Eugene wore a dress heels and a wig I wouldn't be able to tell if he's a boy or a girl
I wish I was a tall woman! I wear heels to make me look a bit taller! I'm 4'11, that is very small compared to normal women.  tall women make me jealous!
Eugene is so hot in this video. Would definetly let him grind on me if I met him in a bar. Maybe even pay him to do it. Yup. Would DEFINETLY pay him to do it.
Really really good solution to all of this women. Don't wear them lol.
I just take my shoes off before wearing flats😂
"The stilettos are so tall they'll motherf***ing kill you"

Eugene 2017
Eugene's sexy drop then that nice pull up tho ...gotta copy that asap😁😁😁😁😁 these guys are really cute ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤...odd moment 😶Keith has nice feet..pretty smooth 👣👣👣👣👀👀👀👀🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒
"The stiletto is so tall that they'll motherfucking kill you." 
-Eugene 2017
I feel like Zac got it SO EASY, that's what I wear as like casual booties/heels
But like when Eugene was dancing in those heels, he looked SUPER SEXY
This video would have been more interesting if they went to straight bars and not gay bars in weho where this isn't un common.
why are they called heels when you're on your toes?
Can we acknowledge that when he almost got hit by a car, it was a rolls Royce
they should have tried the men version, shoes with a high insole so from the outside people can't see that they're actually wearing some heels inside the shoes. it's popular in South Korea, because many shorter celebrities there use them (i'm a kpop and kdrama fanatic so i know these things)
😂😂😂😩😩😩😩
😏
The conclusion is that Eugene is a Stripper when wearing heels.





Same
I can't relate..my best friend literally wear heels everyday.
cool try guys are awesome , good job team
What shoes did Zach wear? I love ankle boots😍👌
Where can I get Zack's heels? Hahaha XD
eugene.
it's great when people can't straighten their legs in heels
Well, they certainly made those high heels work. wink, wink I'm watching you Brendon.
Eugene always goes harder than the rest of the guys
I haven't gotten my period yet but I imagine that it's worse than this
2:40 YAAAAASSSS SLAY Y'ALL SLAAAAAAAY
1:36 those are NOT stilletos, stilletos are nine inch tall monsters who often have an extra inch of heel under your toes, THOSE are little 3 inch tall heels I would wear to a grade school dance

2:14 THOSE are stilletos
The math one is so true
HE WILL NOT DIVIDE US
Eugene.
They probably made a bet with a guy in a chiffon skirt
#GIRLSTRUGGLES!!
at 6:42 there are at a strip club
Zach's doesn't count
Zachs outfit was on point
I freakin love Eugene
Funny how the boots look like normal hipster guy shoes
I'm sorry but Eugene's squat, bend and snap is what I live for now

edit: Eugene in general is now what I live for
so extra, so so extra


but I'm not complaining
"Sittin great" -Keith
where can i buy those boots zach was wearing?
Nothing is as great as when chunky heels and boots come in style at the same time. "Look! I can be sexy AND not break my neck!"
I can kinda walk easily in heels? not thin heels that's just..rip Eugene
but thicker ones like what Zach wore..that's where it's at.
Eugene was killing it with that girl
lol i can wear daggers but like i don't like how they look so i never do
Eugene is wearing the exact same heels that I have
I have the same "dagger heels" as Eugene. I've had to run, dance, and jump in them; it's probably one of the hardest things I've done in any theater production! I can't imagine spending more than two hours in them. :O
wait! HEELS HAVE NAMES!!
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT, ILL MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK- BRENDON BOYD URIE (Beebo)
Zach looked amazing
Zack looked so good in those heels :O
You guys are noobs I wear 6 inch heels for long periods of time and don't sit down and my feet ARE FINE and it doesn't even hurt. But still cool video!
i love Eugene he is me when i hit the dance floor
I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt


But I make these high heels work.
I may have made a mistake...
But I look hot.

- Eugene   😂😆😄
they are WORKING these
But weren't they drag queens before?
Ned is me - you have 2 entrees  I WAS HUNGRY
You Try Guys are so crazy wearing high heels, #giveitup Eugene! #Sohotbaby
eugene is just amazing as hell and hot af
zack is so funny :))
Laganja and Shangela YASsssss
I'm a sophomore in high school and wore about 4 inch heels from 7 am-11 pm. I can into school late and they were calling pictures for bowling so I sprinted to my locker and then to pictures in heels. I was limping by the end of the night. I ad to go to a college with my choir so that's why I was out so late 😂
OMG IS ZACH WEARING STEVE MADDEN CAUSE I HAVE THE EXACT SAME PAIR
I'm a 12 year old boy and I can walk in heels better than these people!
i think zach made the best decision on shoes, i think he wont get tired that fast
I always just say, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR HEELS. I am a teenage girl and I don't even own heels because it is unnecessary pain on my body.
"Who's that man walking down the street with those delicate feet? It's Zach!" Love it.
Zach honestly got the most comfortable shoes. CHEATER
Sachs should probably keep these and start wearing them
Zach is daddy
I wear ankle boots like that all winter and some of spring, they're really comfortable, nothing like stilettos
I just don't wear heels and hope men just start to get it when you don't want to be in pain. It looks good but flats feel good.
Zack looks the best in heels
Zach's heels look like they're just apart of his outfit😭
I love those ankle boots!!!
That feeling when you take them off
eugene is hott
Yes, their butts got better xD
Okay but whoever marries Eugene is the luckiest person in the world
Not only Eugene's shoes were lethal weapons, he was also wearing the wrong shoe number, so that sure added to the pain toll.
I legit think that Eugene could be the best stripper ever
Dammit cause Zach has smaller f***ing feet than me, I wear 12
I have three 8 inch high heels! My sister hates me because I can go through 6 hours with them!
ARIEL AND BECKY!!!!!!!❤❤
Eugene looks nice in those dagger pumps,his pants make him look like he has a girl booty in yoga pants. lol👅
I'm freaking 12 and I wear heels a day long
Kamna??? where you at?
I've watched this multiple times, and it doesnt get less funny 
this is hilarious
Knew Eugene would pull it out the bag with the stilettos
Of course Eugene had to chose the killer heels XDDD
NONE of the sidewalks are even!
but the high heels that they chose represent their personalities so well
If I were in Neds PositionRandom person steps on my footMe: OwwwwRandom guy: Welcome to the real worldI charge him in the backMe: Welcome to the real world
There is something wrong with Eugene 😂
Zach can get heels like that for men if he wants to be taller
After Ariana Grande finishes up her tour, you guys should do a video with her in which she teaches you guys her routines that she does in like 5in heels! She literally jumps around in those heels
The shoes are cute tho
Where can I get Zach's heels...
how is it possible for Eugene to be the manliest and girliest at the same time
Ned: "You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels"
Ned is definitely my spirit animal 😂😂😂
I love how they don't even question their masculinity.
That said, heels hurt every time you wear them. But I'm short and won't be taken seriously if I wear flats. The struggle, yo
I love Eugene so much
I needed a laugh today, thanks guys.
i ship them so much....
I just don't find heels to be anymore painful than other shoes. Ballet flats are the most painful thing in the world to wear. Horrible shoes, they hurt just to put on, let alone walk around in. I have tried on 20 pairs of flats and they all freaking hurt like hell.
but zacs heels are so easy to walk in 😂
Eugenes legs are the most sexiest i've ever seen XD
lmao the way they walk omg i cant 😂
the moment when he threw away the shoes, and then was like "lol no, just kidding, they costed money"
I like Zach's shoes the best
:o 02:32 Eugene !!  Not wanting to be mean but the ankle boots are the least, Eugene with those 6 inches was hot!!
But for real Zach picked the best and smartest choice. I would have only gone for those boot heels; maybe even a little shorter. 

Also totally understand the height struggle. When my friends are all taller than me and I look like a child but I don't want to destroy my feet.
8:01 That was not just a car! That was ROLLS ROYCE!
What a fabulous video.
2:33 sigh, why cant i look that good in ankle breaking heels
best advice for heels: walk as if you aren't wearing heels! keep your natural stride
I want those six inches... ;-;
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK!
What a bunch of benders ahahaha
I LOVE heels but you should definitely know which one to wear for a fancy dinner and which one  to wear for a night out 😂
Zachs ankle boots are lit, Id like to know where he got them from!
Me thinking I should wear heels for my birthday today and after this video nevermind
when the try guys wear better in heels than you... 😵😵😵
I loves those Daggers!!
zachs are only half an inch taller than mine but they're the same style
Eugene is crazy he wore 6 INCH HEELS for most of the night how even
when I try heels with different heights it's not that bad to walk I'm 13,and male and I know how to walk heels but Eugene was into it but he chose the very high one he made a mistake
Eugene would be the most extra with the heels
They all looked great in their heels but if you've never worn them for a long time before they are gonna be hell. Props to all of them for lasting as long as they did. Damn, Eugene... well done. And yes you looked hot AF but you couldn't pay me to wear 6 inch heels.
can you believe Eugene is 31????
i wish try guys, try some painful face masks
i just want to say- i wear heels bigger than everyone but eugene every day
i have a question.....why do most the girls wear heels if they hurt so bad?...btw im a girl XDD
Zachary had the go to comfy heel
dont do this to them please dont
Off topic: Have the try guys tried Finnish Sauna before?
High heals are NOT hot, Their just wrong!
All of you guys over here obsessing and thirsting over Eugene where as I'm thinking ned is really hot
Keith might turn into ned later..
Eugene is pushing himself sooo hard, OMG I'm crying...
like hi heel
if you like uegene like me



 subscribe!!
kuddos to u Huge-ne Ugene ;) even i am a girl n really feminine, i dont think i can pull off wear that all night long as u did.....hail up to u! ur ma n sisters should be proud x
The boots were the best option haha
Hands down to Eugene he's wearing extremely high heels which are too big for him.
"I'm just trying to get home without a broken ankle"- me everytime i wear heels
Watch out Ned and Ariel, cause Keith and Becky are hittin da town.
zach has it easy
Some of my friends have this ridiculous rule that they subscribe to which is if you wear the heels, you leave in the heels. I have LONG since given up with that because the only one who ends up suffering is you. I carry foldable flats in my bag and a set in my car and when I'm done, I'm done. I don't feel sexy AF when my feet are bleeding, the pads of my feet are throbbing, my arches hurt, or from the friction from walking 2 miles in them trying to get from the crap parking to a club. I wear them as long as I can and I feel comfortable and cute but then I tap out or I just wear lower heels to begin with if I know it's going to be a long walk situation.
dont you feel like their heels represent their personalities really well
!But I make these high heels work!
5:45 
Engine is officially the best person on earth. 😂😂😂
How did Eugene dance soo good in heels? Damn
"I almost got hit by a car... that was pretty chill" if that ain't me idk what tf is . 👏🏼😂
Ned is so cute❤He is my favourite❤
always trust Eugene to be fuckin' extra man.
I can feel the pain wearing Eugene's heels just by watching this video
Eugine is definitely the dramatic hot girl, she is always wearing the highest and sexiest shoes, lol. 

But seriously, taking your heels off after a long night out are better than an orgasm. Sorry guys.
I'm a size five with low arches.  AKA, anything above two and a half inches, and I'm tapping out (even though I'm under five feet tall).  The REAL secret is, wear wedges and thick-soled heels.  Sure, you aren't as sexy, but your feet also aren't committing suicide after a day of activity.
Zack is wearing Harry styles boots
I used to wear heels all the time but it started taking a toll on my feet, like even walking in slippers were uncomfortable. So I started switching to booties, then because of work and walking around for 12 hours I switched to tennis shoes and now I can't even wear a heel for more that a couple hours max. And only platforms with a big chunky heel. It's hard to get back in the high heel game after being out for so long.
They kind of picked heels according to their personality. Of course Eugene picks the dagger heels.
When I wear heels I try my damn best to stay in them from the moment I get in them until the end of the night when it's time to take them off. I just have a secret competition with all the other girls wearing heels, and I vow to keep them on longer than all of them 😂😩 it hurts really bad but so far I've always outlasted them. idk why I do it but it's fun to challenge myself even when I'm dying, my mom always asks how I do it. the only time I didn't survive was on New Years it was way too many hours and I just couldn't handle it 😂
my favourite part 3:28
I'm sorry, my thirst thought was bts Taehyung
It's 1:00 am and I started dying when Ned fell and I share a room with my sister it was so FREAKING HARD to try to keep it in😂💀
i wear a size 12... in mens..... im 15.... yeah try to find me shoes that i like.... i dare you....
My feet hurt just watching this video ugh man watching Eugene in those heels 😰 i liked Zach's heels and outfit the best! He looked so good!!
When you take heels off and put your foot back into the ground it feels like your whole foot melts into the ground
Goddam of course Eugene would get six inch dagger stilettos!!! And look fantastic. Way better than I would be in them.
MEN DO LOOK HOT UN HEELS!
junps into trash can to grab shoes
the ankle boots are the most comfortable
Okay, so where can I find a Eugene?
Oh ya Eugene si hot
I knew from just looking at the title that Eugene would rock it.
Zqck was the smart one to choose close toed, comfortable shoes
Next time they shouldn't be allowed to have the women there as back up
u guys are crazy
The dagger strikes 

when he flat out he dishonerd his famiry 
(not to be racist)
the way keith said toenails 1:13
in heels, they walk like chickens
Omg as a reminder you guys should stick one of the daggers in the wall as a trophy 🤣
ariel is so pretty
Zack, I think you are just the best!
"My feet are on the dirty ground but I don't care." EXACTLY! No more making fun of barefoot girls.😂
Damn Eugene, I would love to get a dance
I feel like I could survive in Zach's heels, but not the rest. Especially NOT in Eugene's heels.
Keith: "Aw you can only see four of my toes. Why did i paint all ten of my toes if you can only see 7"
Me: 4 plus 4 is 8 keith
😂😂😂
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHY ZACH LOOKS SO FINE IN HIGH HEELS LIKE DAMN SON
DID KEITH SAY FIANCÉE
lol!!!!!😂😂😂😂 poor guy! at 5:28 when they step on his toe,sorry not sorry
What's the song in 4:20?
Kpop idols should introduce Buzzfeed men to the magical world of *insoles*, for short men.
i want that Eugene's Try Guys shirt!!
Next 
Try guys wear period pads for a week.
Ned and Eugene's asses were POPPIN ya heard? lol
I thought of me wearing high heels and then thought of riding my skateboard 

Yea nag brah I'm fine
THE ONLY SERIES WHERE THE PEOPLE HAVENT CHANGED!
woah eugene
They should do try guys do SFX makeup on themselves
The stripper tho 5:47 (far left)
It's so fitting that Zach wore the most comfortable and Eugene the tallest and most uncomfortable
Zach looks really good.
Eugenes heels are too big for him haha
once again zach was the smart one
I might be young but I know the pain most of my female family members had to go through while at a baby shower, banquet, wedding or christening, while wearing heels. I mean the whole banquet takes a crap ton of time. 6-8 hours tops.
the worst part is when you take them off for a bit then have to put them back on cause your feet had time to swell it hurts worse than before D:
Man, cosplay shoes are like this too. So much pain for fashion. >.<
Zach and Eugene...YEEEEEEES
they should try doing an escape room!! that would be amazing and highly entertaining 😂
I agree with Ariel
My college has a "walk a mile in her shoes" in which men would wear heels while the females would wear tennis shoes...this reminded me of that.
is it just me or is ned getting hotter like every video
i wore high heal boots to collage every day plus walking to smoking area 3 time the cafe 3 times and coffee bar plus walking to classes and walking home after I'd still have my boots on when I got home I'd take them off before bed best part were they had grip on the bottom of my shoes they worked grate in the snow and ice but when its snow and ice I pulled my mettle toecaps out
Dude I can't even stand up in heels for 5 seconds, and I'm a girl
Zack's heels don't count! They don't hurt, and you can walk easily in them. They're everyday shoes😒
Eugene haha
Panic! at the disco anyone?
Ned's wife looks like chapman from oitnb
Heels are actually very dangerous. They can improve the risk of ingrown toenails by a lot. Ingrown toenails are painful and terrible.
I would love to see try guys /learn to walk in heels/. They start with a kitten heel, go to a wedge, then a chunky heel, pump theeeen stilletos. Id love to see the guys try  walk run and  dance (especially Eugene) after they've learned how to wear them.
Hah I have shoes like Eugene's and women's size 5.5 feet.  Ballet training does have some uses
DANG they drunk a little two much God dang😂😂😂😂
Of course Eugene had to go all out
Keith face at  3:23 tho!😂😂😂
Of course Zach looks more cute then me in those boots
EUGENE I CANT LMAO HIS DANCING
Heels is hell on your feet!
As soon as I saw Eugenes choice of heels, I knew he was done for. 😂
what kind of batty man ting is this
Zach lasted the longest but Eugene was killing it! (Haha, it's a joke 'cuz they're dagger heels)
Zach's actually looked pretty good!
Paused at 5:06 it looks like it is an old colored movie
Jack was being smart personally I think the others where being kinda stupid🙃😐😐😐🙃
the try guys try to be smart for once! jk
Eugene is my spirit animal
You just know Eugene practiced wearing those before this video lol
Eugene... I'm crushed..
they actually look really good in the heels- especially zack
I love these guys!!!
Does Eugene have a girlfriend
They should do a try guys video of guys dancing in heels. Like Yanis Marshall!
My feet hurt just watching this
You did good Eugene ❤
"But I make these high heels work" - Brendon Urie aka "Fivehead" aka "Milk God"
I was watching this and all I could think was "Eugene would make a good frank n futer from Rocky Horror Picture show"
And now dance like the guys in Madonna's Girl Gone Wild....
I now have a new respect for women in heels
EUGENE ACTUALLY SLAYS MY LIFE MORE THAN EVER IN THIS VIDEO OMFG
zacs shoes are the only ones I was would ever wear
eugene is just from another planet I swear
I was fangirling so damn hard when Eugene was grinding and getting down low
Eugene is so extra I love it
Damn, that girl was all over Eugene
"I may have made a terrible mistake.... but I look hot" me every time I go out
Eugene be slayingg
Why do men have trouble wearing heels. We girls usually don't.
You know, high heels were originally for men. So, you could keep wearing them Zach.
Eugene has the most dangerous and Zach has the safes
ariel has a lovely smile and i see why Ned married her. their relationship is so cute. Sorry Ned i know you cant respond
I loved Zach's and Eugene's heels XDD And yeah, they're a pain but make my legs look incredible XD
lmao😂😂😂his dancin
where can I get the shirt with the names on?
'Not that wasted, jist wearing heels' MEE. Everytime I'm out and I trip people assume I'm super drunk, I'm just clumsy and it's hard to walk with heels on.
i would wear the shoes zack was wearinh
0:26 - 0:30 fun? well he's in for a suprise!
I was feeling so bad for eugene as i know the feeling ugh
Hell yeah Eugene. Hell yeah
Eugene , NO
yeah, more men should wear heels!
Someone should teach them how to walk in them. They would've slayed this whole thing and would have got to the bar quicker😂
Like, Eugene can fcking dance. 

Heels just make him hotter.
2:32 im gonna need about 10 continuous hours of this
All the shoes represent them
Heels. Ouch. Dagger heels. Kill the wearer and the attacker if used properly.
I may have made a terrible mistake... But I look hot.
-- Eugene, 2017
Didn't they do this already? 🤔
i feel bad for them especially the one w/ 6in TALL
I really hope they don't leave buzzfeed !!
6:19 I LOST IT
I wish I was that girl Eugene was dancing with
6:22 - 6:30 is it just me or did he sound like deadpool
Should've brought flats LOL
When you arrive to school 5:39
Okay low key the heels looked good on Zach
the music they used for Eugene has me crying bc it's meant for a funeral. Lmao
i actually like Zack's shoes. I NEED THEMM!!
Eugene is always so extra and I'm so here for it
*Sees Eugene in thumbnail*

He can do it. He can do everything
I love try guy's 😚
2:32 YAAAAASSSS
Okay coodles to all four of them especially Eugene for dancing like that in dagger heels. like i cant even walk in those so gg dude.
How does Eugene look sexy AF in EVERYTHING?!
He is probably as close to perfect as humanly possible.
Onision probably disliked this video
i have one of Zach's heels and they are simply the most pretty and comfortable things ever
"MAN DOWN! MAN DOWN!"
You mean lady down?
laughing alllll the way through. Eugene so extra, i love him
Zach's heels weren't bad. they were just booties
Eugene, 2 words- Marry me. 
(That dancing was amazing!!!!)
try guys become mermaids
Dude I feel like this all the time bc if my plantar fasciitis. Google it I'm to lazy
Eugiene, I'm so proud of you for lasting so long in those demons! :O It takes training to wear heels for a prolonged period of time, believe you me! XD And one of the best feelings in the world is if it's been raining, to take your shoes of, and step barefeet on that cold, wet asphalt, it's soooooo soothing... :O Just never take them off if you want to wear them again shortly after, 'cause your feet will swell.. xD
Shout out to whoevers home that is, it's gorgeous 😍
And boys, you did well!
eugene is such a G
i love how in any try guys video where eugene is being sexy almost every comment will be about that
Zach looks cute in those boots!
I'm half way thorough the video and suddenly I realise... I'm watching buzz feed. I'm watching buzz feed? WELL ITS ALL OVER FOR ME
HOW ARE ZACH AND EUGENE SINGLE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
it's upsetting that eugene is always killing it
Eugene and Keith are wearing our companies heels!! Yay!
Eugene's my favorite in those heels (and out) He's so gorgeous!
Keithhhhhh would you be a dear and lend me a shoulder
Give me wide based wedges and I could walk a mile
Not fair 😂😂😂 they should've all worn the same kind of heels!
I don't where heals but when kieth took of his I think it felt like when I take of my bra
They all look great in heels
I wore heals for a cosplay at a convention. They were low and quite chunky heals. I was dying. How do other girls do it!?!?
This video is just a bunch of grown drunk men In heels 😂😂why tf did I watch this
Is it me or Ned looks like Frodo?
.....a married Frodo, obviously :)
'You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels'😂
Gross
"Dinner is sitting. Sitting's great"
okay my gaydar is going off for eugene, how did i just notice it
Eugene is so extra, i love it
I went to a party at new years and everyone thought I was drunk because of my shoes
Wait...why was Eugene slightly than usual sexier in those stilettos? I'm so confused..
Big girl why you all in bare feet? Walking down that dirty city street
Keep your shoes on honey 'til you make that money, 'cause your toenails draggin' and it sure ain't funny.
"painted my t'nails" ..wat
Did they have consent to film in those strip clubs?
ok.....now it's time for a night out with wedges and platforms so u can compare them :)
Now these guys understand why girls would rather walk on the dirty streets with their heels in their hands then keep their shoes on.
zach actually looked good in his tho
I like Zach 😎
The try guys have never been so fckn fabulous.
Saw Eugene In Thumbnail
Click Immediately
I'd only ever wear the boots that zach has, stilettos are a no go 😹
Eugene I have heels like that and I'm literally 13 and can still wear them for 4 hours max
My feet on the dirty ground
but I don't care
my feet on the dirty ground
but I don't care

Sample that, pitch it down and you got the start of a Trap music track.
"Fun." You are SO funny Eugene.
Eugene had me laughing so hard.
So after that "guys walk a mile in high heels" video or whatever it was called, Buzzfeed recycles itself.
I liked Zach's booties :) those are some shoes I'd wear. All the others are a no go for me. To all people who are going to wear heels: you should practice before or you will bend your knees and look like a squatted t-rex in pain.
Next up on buzzfeed fake tan is black face
I would so wear Zachs heels because the other ones are just painful
I'm living for Keith's toenails. Also I love how he says toenails.
Yes you go Eugene!!!👠👠👠👠👠💃🏻💃🏻💃🏻
this is a longer form of deja vu
BUT DOES IT MAKE MY BUTT LOOK GOOD?!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
am i the only one that thinks eugene got a size too large? o-o they looked a bit lose o:
EUGENE SLAYING AS ALWAYS
Eugene rocks those damn. He should wear them more often. More practical androgynous ones.
i love how comfortable Eugene is with his sexuality, but he confuses me sometimes
I wonder how many people saw Zach and thought he was just trying to make himself taller
i have 6.5 inch heels and they are murder. Eugene you did well
Well i guess this video clears up the debate whether Eugene is into girls..
It's fun to Dance in the floor-Ned
My favorite part about this is watching them all walk in them, it looks so unnatural and clunky haha I don't know what makes it possible to walk in heels effortlessly, but I just can?
Eugene is my bias. Can I say that?
do a other prank vid
.
I want Eugene 's shirt!!
I love try guys!!!!!:P
eugene has never been more bi than in this video
For god sakes, bring back Cayenne Pepper.  Like, bring back the drag personas just one more time.
Congratulations on destroying your feet!
Drunk me once tried really hard to leave my high heels on a shelf at a 24 hour grocery store because I was so mad at how sore my feet were. I just walked around bare foot until one of my less drunk friends realized what I had done, went and found my shoes, and made me wear them while in the store. Then I just walked home carrying them (the store was very close to my house). But I've also been on public transit barefoot before (bus, not cab) when my shoes broke on a night out. I am usually Zach on a night out now: never anything too high, ankle boots or wedges.
Omg any Army's here remember when V wore those heels and DANCED in them like he'd been living with them? Remember that miracle!? This video gave me flashbacks! Ahhhh memories... 🤤🤤☺️😊
3 inch boots? I wear them ALL DAY! What you do when you're 4'9"!
"Do you have any advice for us"
Ariel: "Don't"
Wait wait Kieth is getting married?
zach's outfit was super cute 😍
Eugene is me when i'm wearing heels lol
Eugene in stilettos omd.
WORK IT EUGENE

tbh i think guys in high heels are hot
Yaassss Eugene slaying all the haters, literally 😂
6:12.. Damn, Eugene.
My feet hurt just by watching this 😂👣
Didn't Eugene wore high heels before?
EUGENE IS SO HOT
Those boots aren't what I would call "high heels" There not hard to walk in AT ALL compared to the rest of the guys heels.
I'm pretty sure I have worn zacs entire outfit before now, the ankle boots, ripped jeans, khaki bomer
Goddamn Eugene!!!...you are fire!
SUBSCRIBE to become a millionaire at some point in your life
Are you sure you guys aren't just a little bit gay?
Oh editors of the video, you don't have to put Ariels title as "Ned's wife", we already know
Who else ships Kelsey Darragh and Eugene Lee Yang?
😂😂😂😂😂you made my day 
I love you guys 😍😍
There's no YouTube red in the uk.
they wear high heels better then me.. i remember one time i wear heels i fell .. doesn't make sense because i was just standing.. i have no idea how the hell did i fell ..
Zach you can buy boots like that for guys, the heel isn't as big so you won't be in pain but you still get to feel taller if you want and get that booty pop! Also guys, pro tip; gel inserts can save your life. Especially if you bring an extra pair and double up half way through the night
Ned looks so so so much better with longer hair. & I love how Keith is dressed.
As a person who wears four and a half inch heels every day of my life for any activity I really think they should have done this for a week. Start with kitten heels and low wedges, and work up to platforms and stilettos, then on their last day wearing them the guys wear the highest pair the got up to during the week and wear those for the entire night out. Also then the shoes would be broken in because that was a little dickish.
The try guys especially zack should TRY fish massage 😂
Zach and Eugene were so adorable together at the end, love how Zach was worrying, and he clearly made the smartest shoe choice - good man
Why were they allowed to film in a strip club
They should wear the thong, wear the bra, wear the clothes and then add the heels and go out for 4 to 5 hours dancing.
definitely won't happen to me, when I know I'm out partying, dancing and drinking, my converse serve the job just as well instead of killing me throughout the night! XD
Omg those dagger heels... Why are you doing that to yourself? WHY?
best buzzfeed video so far...
Eugenes are too big
Love how Ned just tosses his heels into the trash!!!!
Don't be a drag, just be a queen 👠
They all walked like a pregnant person in sims 3

They were all might fine in those shoes though
Omg
Let's face it I haven't watch the video yet but I know Eugene is gonna look the most fabulous on it and we love it
When your to tall to wear high heels cause guys are intimidated by you
BEST PART OF THE VIDEO 9:51
Of course Eugene has to win and be better than the rest... Like always!
The try guys for LIFE baby❤️
Why is Eugene so perfect like... why do Asian guys look the best in a group of guys... like no offence but goddammmmnnn
"Bar" goes to strip club haha yes!
okay but Zach actually looked good in those ? as in, some girls wish they could ? He should keep them to wear them again maybe once or twice just sayin
Eugene gotta booty
Good luck, men of the 21st century .
But one of the worst things to do is take heels and then put them back on. Always have flats
I wear heels on occasion. Longest was 9 hours with 7in heels. They had a platform but I did not have feeling in 3 toes for about a month. Like legit. So serious nerve damage is possible lol
neds hair looks real good here
These heels are tiny, try wearing the 8inch at least heels women normally wear, like Eugene.
i only watched 18 sec and i think they look already sexy in these heels DAMNN
I can't stop looking at that Tagine (Moroccan Pot) at the back in the beginning of this video 😀
Where can I get those heels Eugene had omg
I can't imagine six-inch heels. I wore 4 inch heels in San Francisco once and my toes on one foot actually started going numb the next morning. Never again.
Is it weird that the thumbnail turned me on??
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
gay AF
Why is Eugene all ways so hot it's so unfair
oh god the memories.... i would drink purely to numb my feet, because after 4hrs of dancing its like your foot bones are broken.
the types of friends (as family) is so clear in this vid
what heels is Zach wearing?
oh my godd ... Eugene.. thats ..wow.. like WOW...! is there anything this man can't do!!???😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Oh sorry KATIE is the best. MOFO'S NEVER lose katie. sorry. she's kinda a tryfi yoda. just saying
best try guys Freakin EVER!!!!
Next video idea. Eugene teaches the Try Guys to Club Dance.
I see eugine, I click.
Not wasted, just wearing heels- me 😂😂✌🏻
why does Eugene look amazing in everything. has me bent.
My feet are about 6 inches long. I do NOT wonna be in those heels.
I can party all night in my high heels but I don't think I'd have made it nearly as long as Eugene in those monstrosities, seriously well done on that one lol
Next up: the try guys try licking just the tip of another mans penis
Wore heels out this weekend. Literally pinched a nerve and lost sensation in three of my toes for three days. Still rocked it tho
Eugene looks better in heels than I ever will
Can I have a birthday shoutout 😀
Omg zack is so cute
I want that shirt Eugene is wearing
Eugene looks like your hot Asian mother on a girls night out...
well, high heels were originally invented for men so they could be trailer and more intimidating. zach should Rick those cute boots whenever he wants!
Every girls dream to dance with ugene
Lol the car that gets close to Zach is a Rolls Royce. I love America
Try Guys try.... 
INSTAGRAM MAKEUP!!!
Zack looks good for a boy in heels
HOW DID I MISS THIS VIDEO
Eugene is...just Eugene
"so when i was challenged to dance.....i motherfucking danced!"
"So when I was challenged to dance. . . I muthafuckin /danced/"

And yeah, yup. Yes, he did. Eugene muthafuckin D A N C E D
These men are seriously the best. Love watching them
geez! I freaking love Eugene!!!
Eugene
Stop
You're way too hot
Eugene would have felt a whole lot more comfortable in those heels if they had fit him right
" WHAT IS HAPPENING!!?? "
He haves Dagger on his feet!! And idk!!
So men look good in high heels nice!
People mock college age girls for wearing ugg boots a lot but theyre basically anti heals, the heal cure.
There's a lot of uneven terrain😂
This was posted on my birthday and I wore heels that day.
6:24-6:28 That girl is the luckiest  person in the world
"They pop on four extra inches! I can't compete with that!!" Yeah Zach, WE KNOW.
Their feet looks so beautiful! mine has black stuff permanently stuck on the center of each toe fingers.
Eugene I pray for your feet!!! 😂😂😂
I once had to wear six inch, pencil-thin heeled thigh high boots to advertise for a superhero costume for a shop at a convention and I gotta tell you, after standing for 8+ hours on concrete with only one break where I could actually sit--I was ready to hurt people! Like, me and this other girl were leaning on trashcans and posing on the floor because our ankles were swelling!
My fiancé painted my "tunails" 😂
Zach actually works the heel boots! He should invest!
Ned's jeans tho
Can the Try Guys just get their own channel? I don't want to get subscribed to buzzfeed video, but I do not get notified when Try Guys upload...
Sorry had to bring it up
KNEESLAPPER!
I have such sensitive feet I wouldn't even be able to walk from apartment to my car in those dagger heels. EVERY pair of heels I have every worn including booties and tiny kitten heels make my toes rub and bleed D:
Part of it is also anatomy, though. Because I have a really high arch,  I actually do very well for long periods in stack heel or block heel boots - they're my go-to for work/daily wear. The position of the heels doesn't bother me and the support of the heels balances things out so I don't stress my knees out too much. Stilettos or spikes in general are a nightmare, no matter what the hight, because my knees are just too unstable to compensate for them. So my anatomy means I can wear five inch stack heels on boots all day and be fine, but can't wear 1 inch kitten heels to walk across a room without chancing blowing out a knee. This explains the large number of stack and block heels in my closet.
I loved this a little too much!! They finally feel our pain!! I always "flat out" 🤣🤣
I don't know why I expected any less from Eugene
How was Zach even complaining like those are everyday type shoes lol
I swear Eugene could wear a fat suit with a fake beard and look sexy. 
JustAsianThings
And they expect girls to where heels
I really just despise high heels. I don't find them attractive on women, I find them inefficient and hilariously impractical. It is like putting on a clown costume to appear attractive... why?
Everything Eugene wears he looks good in.
Let's be honest.
Buzzfeed is cancer
In all honesty though, Zach looked really good in those heels. Sometimes seeing a guy in heels will make you look twice cause it's not something you see every day but, somehow those ankle boots didn't look out of place. They were also the most sensible heel.
wtf heels arent even hard to walk in. theyre painful yeah but its easier for me to walk in heels than sandls
Neither literally verbalized wheat all women Say internally when we take out heels off
I love how they all have the perma-bent knees walking in those
Flats all the way...
even the gogo dancers are wearing flats they know whats up
Of course Eugene picked the most sexy, most painful heels
So happy they got those shoes out!
WHY IS EUGENE GOOD AT EVERYTHING !!!!💕🎉😇
ankle boots are my favorite omg
Zach got the easy ines
Heels were made for men. Seriously, they were made for men when it was invented. I think I learned it from Buzzfeed.
Ok Ned's butt, tho
Eugene looks hot without heels or with..
Holy mother Mary of useless information...😂..Watching him walk around in those "toothpick" stilettos is hilarious!!!! I could tell by how far he was leaning back that he was trying to take the pressure off of the front of his feet. We women all know that lean...😂
They looked good in heels. Now I want a man that wears heels.
Zack chose cute heels. Why do the rest have such bad taste? Honestly zacks shoes were cute enough that a guy could pull them off. Maybe that's just me.
you know what screw hat guy who said "welcome to the real world" like cmon man don't be a Dickson
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT, BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK.          👠👢👡
Every girl ever has booties that look like Zach's.
Anyone who's ever worn heels. Felt the relief with Keith when he took those heels off!
OMG Keith's face when saying "sitting's great" totally reminds me of #LelePons 😂😆
This is just weird
OKAY NOW I'M SCARED. I have to wear heels all day for my cousin's wedding and there will not be that much seats. God help me.
"Where would I wear this, I wouldn't." Katie
eugene is so extra i love it
when I do wear heels, any bigger than 3 inches, i always aim for pumps. pumps make you taller but they're SO MUCH BETTER
lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt , but I make these high heels work
Why is Zach wearing the same outfit as me
Heels are no joke! lol I got married on Friday and literally took my heals off in the middle of the ceremony before my vows because they hurt so bad. I couldn't concentrate on what my husband was saying. I didn't put them back on again 😂😂😂
Of course Eugene doesn't like Christmas.
Eugene went all out on the dance floor
5:48 strippers?
You guys should do "The Try Guys have the best bachelor party for Keith's bachelor party"
I just sprained my ankle and I'm laughing so hard because right now I can't even get in tennis shoes XD
Next time do it in the boob weights
Try running in heels
Heels actually harm your feet
Congrats your destroying your feet.
You weren't cat-called, Ned. Don't make light of a very intimidating and frightening situation that women are often faced with.
this is the quality kind of content I watch the try guys for
3 inches are considered kitten heels now?  Geez, I'm old!
heels are really bad for your back so maybe dont
Nice DTMWAGT tribute. Sorry my bad English. (Edit? Never.)
zach's shoes were too easy in my opinion lmao i have practically those same shoes and i wear them to skill which is around 9 hours
Ned's me at dinner
the asian guy had the tallest heels and he didn't COMPLAIN as much as the others!!😒😒😒
zach voice oh my god Keith's getting got a fiancé
Eugene has his incredible leg muscles to thank for lasting that long is shoes like that. Anyone else wouldn't have made it for more than an hour.
but i make these high heels work
Eugene, the overachiever..... those things look dangerous as hell.
can i buy Zach's heels??😄
Wowww they wear heels better than me!!!
Omg Eugene I cantttt
Poor Eugene... his heels weren't the right size.  he was doomed to fail from the beginning. :(
Zach has some damn good fashion sense, I'd wear those heels. His are the only cute ones!
i want Zach's booties badly (":
I think Zach actually looked pretty nice with the heels..........
You should try high heels on calçada portuguesa (portuguese pavement)
Was I the only one who thought Zack was the most strategic? Because everyone else's choices made my feet hurt just looking at them.
Eugene Asian squatting the entire time 😂
i just realized that eugene's shirt said the try guys' names #SQUADGOALS
When you take your heels off after a night out: BEST. FEELING. EVER!!
It was upsetting that
1) I would wear zach's entire outfit
2) that EUGENE still looked hot af
3) They were all so cool about this entire thing I wanna give them a hug. All of them.
Zach should wear those boots more often. He looks pretty good
I really wanna have a husband like Ned.... He can be sexy, funny and serious at the same time.
Oml they were in a strip club 😂😂
why is eugene better than me at everything
the.... cringe.....
Ankle boots are comfy af
ok now try heels an entire high school day. thats eight hours. with stairs. 




H  U  N  T  Y
this is why I don't wear high heels.....mostly because they don't have my shoe size, but other than that, they are evil devices of Satan
Eugene looked so fine in those heels
That was a rolls Royce should have went ahead and got hit
I did this for a whole day and my feet not hurt
Let's take a minute to talk about how Eugene looks good in everything! Dedication.
love you guys
I see them complaining about Neds heels, when my mom wears Eugene's heels. Every. Single. Day.
Eugene should have wore Zack's heels,would have looked much better.
Hey, that t-shirt i sooooo cool! I dig it!
Winners of —
Best overall outfit: Zach. (The whole thing worked and was sexy af)
Toughin it out: Eugene. (Anyone else feel a masochistic streak there? Badass dance moves though)
Most effort: Keith (for gettin his t'nails all purdy)
Best butt: Ned. (Did we think it could look any better? No, but here's the proof!)
Why in the end Zach and Eugene were at a strip club.
I would wear Zach's heels or Keith's heels.
That a$$ tho
I'm a stripper... just imagine
ughh ned's butt is goals im jealous
Ned's butt looked amazing when he was playing pool! also the fitted button up and tight white pants were really working for him! he looked like a prince!
i want Zack to wear heels as a casual, he looks goo in them
did Eugene loose a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, cause he makes those high heels work
Ok but those shoes Eugene wore, I wouldn't even wear those... those are dangerous!!!!!
Is it just me or was Eugene lookin EXTRA good in this video?
is eugene gay?
6:43..is that a male stripper xd
👠👠👠 work them heels work em yasss Eugene 😂😂😂
some girl's : i looove high heels
me: hdkshsks i love Eugene hdkshsk
Props to eugene
Keith is becoming the new Ned with his new fiancé lol
You sissy that walk Eugene, you sissy that walk!
this doesn't count, they are basically females.
Damn I love Zach
Zach got it easy
Ned's butt tho.
I wish I was Eugene
Zach-"what do you think is going to happen? They're ***** daggers"
Me-it's also Eugene sooooooo
"The try guys move in together for a week" < that would be an amazing Video
Eugene was looking so fierce in those heels. I aspire to slay like him.
I would date Zack. anyone else?
i love eugene
They went to a strip club😂
Realist thing ever said
"When you drink it distracts you from the pain." 😂😂😂😂
eugene rocks his confidence like i could never wear those heels as a tall girl
Try Guys should invite men outside from the buzzfeed company to get different opinions ad views into videos. I feel like that would be so funny and different .
0:30. Zach, Zach, Zach...that's kind of the point
Eugene in a bra:Looking Good
Eugene in a diaper:Looking Good
Eugene bald:Looking Good
Eugene in Heels:Looking GOOODDD
C'mon.
Let's face it.
Eugene looks good in everything.
I love how when Eugene just puts on his heels he drops it😂😂😂
NED WHY DID YOU ROLL UP YOUR PANTS
you gotta walk one foot directly in front of the other. they are all clomping like kendal
Eugene should've opted for platform heels if he was gonna wear 6in heels. I've worn 5in heels with platform and I can last a bit longer in them than the 4inch no platform ankle booties I own.
Eugene be rocking those heels
Zack was Slaying the game with his boot heels
If your feet hurt, drink more. British logic :)
I see a lot of half naked male go go dancers.
I'm going to need Eugene to stop slaying my existence.
damn Eugene
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
Wearing heels is like a three hour calf workout
someone please make a gif out of 2:32
Eugene dance moves though
I feel like Zach had an unfair advantage with such sensible heels. I mean, I wear shoes like that to school and they don't hurt at all
I like zac
I know the Eugene looks good, but how have you guys over looked the fact that he doesn't like Christmas!!!
Eugene was the best
It's so easy to walk in heels though
neds wife: "dont"
they gave them the worse type of heels possible lol
I need Eugene's pumps oh my god
I want them to try the period pain simulator😂😂😂
I high-key wanna be that girl grinding on Eugene
Is Eugene gay?
heels are really bad for you feet, ankles, and back
Eugene gets gayer every video😂😂😂 I love him so much though
Ned's heels are actually kinda cute!
i think Zach looks taht cutest😘😘😘😘 love the jacket
ok if anyone can kill it in those heels ins eugene but it pissed me off that they didn't fitttt! Zach's shoes on the other hand were very cute and sensible.
Yas queen! Work them heels gurl!
OH MAN I LOVE EUGENE HE IS SO CUTE
Why are Eugene's so big?!? LOL... Guess that's so they don't hurt SO much.
I would have to guess that you guys have had a lot of experienct wearing high heels.
Eugene HAHAH him dancing is hilarious
These boots look actually pretty natural on Zach... Like, it's nice ! Why don't men wear these more often ?
I would like to see a compilation of every time Ned has said "I'm married" or "my wife."
Prince anyone?
OMFG I LOVE EUGENE'S HEELS I WANT A PAIR
eugene is by far one of the best people to exist
Why are there legs always bent
They need to teach them how to walk before these videos honestly.
6:21 oh you danced alright 😮😲😨
haha, I love you guys!
zach: wearing 3 inch heel boots
HAHAHA
THOSE ARENT LEGIT HEELS
I love when the try guys try feminine things and have a deeper appreciation for women and the standards they are held to
WHO'S THAT MAN WALKIN DOWN THE STREET WITH THOSE DELICATE FEET! ITS ZACK!
Are Eugene's heels the right size? They don't look it
If someone told them to walk heel to toe it'd be so much better, they just think they're supposed to walk like normal and that's why it's really difficult
eugene is a queen omg. i cant even walk without falling on my face.
Okay, but I really love Zach's heels, where are they from lol???
I'm kind of into Zach wearing heels
I love how the last bar is The Abbey
Eugene always does the hardest things like now he pick the highest heels
all the heels i wear is 6in heels and i can wear them up to 6 to 7hrs a day lol
Tbh, they all looked rad with heels.  I feel like Zach looked particularly good though.  Maybe because his shoes were the least like death traps?  Idk.
I want Zach's boots.... They look comfy af
I'm pleasantly surprised how well these heels match their outfits and personality! You go guys! 💕
I'm curious to know if Eugene and Zach are gay?
I've never found heels uncomfortable lmao
EUGENE DANCING IM SCREAMING
yassss eugene
Everybody talking about Eugene when Zach CLEARLY looked amazing in those shoes. Great outfit, great look, 10's across the board.
The try guys got to try to "hakken"
i would only wear ankle boots not dagger pumps
dammm eugene you look good in everthing rock them heels
Next video: walk around barefooted.
....ah..... KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS
asian squat lol
Eugene dancing... I'm so not okay.
am I the only one that gets rip-roaring foot cramps in the arch of my foot after wearing heels? taking them off and standing on the flat ground is super painful for a few minutes after wearing heels for awhile
2:31... YAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSS <3
Eugine is literally what I wanna be 😇
Yeah we get it they hurt... but they're the ones that put them on to ward off / impress other women, if you chose to be in pain then don't expect any comfort or understanding from me.
They all looked super hot wearing heels
Eugene, I LOVE YOU.
"so when i was challenged to dance..... i mothefucking danced" - eugene
eugene always goes over the top
Eugene is more feminine than I'll ever be
Heels are just awful. Feeling bad for fashion is where I draw the line.
Can we just admit that Eugene is a majestic unicorn that could make anything look awesome?
Hey! Welcome To Poses With Eugene!

Eugene: *step 1: Sit down

Eugene: *step 2: PUT ZOZE HEELS ON

Eugene: *step 3: Look At The CAMERAAAA!

Eugene: *step 4: GIVE THAT FACE

Eugene: *step 5: Get Up

Eugene: Do that pose

Eugene: *AND THERE IM SO GOOD A-

Holds On To Curtain
'they look pretty good on men's yup Brendon urie proved that
omg I love this. I would totally dance with Eugene or Zach. And Ned poppin that booty while playing pool 👍😂
Good job guys!!!
HAHAHAAHAHHA
i laffed so hard when they went to the strip club lmaooooooooo
Awww Keith and his fiance are so cute together
Zach's shoes: Ok I would wear those. Eugene's shoes: OH HECK NO!!!!!
I think we need a video where Eugene teaches us his favourite dance moves for winning dance battles~
wait...all their friends/wife conveniently had the same size shoe as them?
while women also have to walk NORMALLY when wearing heels
TWO OF HEARTS TWO HEARTS THAT BEAT AS ONE
I am with Zack I would kill myself probably less in the shoes he is in than the other shoes
Would it be weird to ask where they bought Zach's ankle boots?
Everyone looks hotter on heels!!!! I'm sure they secretly will wear heels again :)
Eugene was so incredibly hot that I could barely take it. And Zack was so damn cool too, he chose the right damn shoes!
I can't even last a hour in one inch heels
I have a huge crush on Eugene he's so adorable
when I was at the women's march in Los Angeles earlier this year, a guy was wearing red stilettos the entire day and had a sign saying "walk a mile in her shoes" and this reminded me of it!!
eugene always does the most
not drunk just wearing high heels kind of just the same thing I wanted to put that out there
This is finally the time

Will you leave me

Are you crazy no

Will you kiss me

When I have the time

Will you hit me

What are you thinking no

Do you love me

Yes

Darling

    ^

Now read it this way
Zach looked damned good in those heels though. And he said he liked it. He should just do it. <3
NED'S WIFE
This video was arousing.
"I may of made a terrible mistake, but I look hot" 😂
Eugene's shoe would have been a bit more comfortable if there was a platform at the toe. That's the only way I can wear super high heels all night.
"My heels for tonight are actually called dagger pumps, because the stiletto is so tall..*turns to camera*..they'll mother fuckin kill you"
eugene looks good in anything
LMFAO!!!!!
I would wear zach's
I wanna see the try guys tyring out gel/acrylicnails for A week
Lmao!! They lasted longer than me 😂
I know i'm not the only guy getting really uncomfortable watching this xD
why do zachs heels look so natural on him 😂
Eugene and Zach my faves. Eugene worked it but when I saw them heels I was like 'And at that moment we all knew he fucked up' 😂😂😂. Also Zach should take charge of his height and work it instead of taking his insecurities out on girls who wear heels. I don't care about the height of someone I'm dating just the heart. Lol corny but true 😂
It's my brithday today, the amount of likes determine my age.
Omg Eugene was getting DOWN dancing at the pool bar with that lady! Damn! 😱😋
6:27 girl you better get your hands of my man you look like you raided the sale section at wet seal with your wig
Those aren't kitten heels Keith is wearing. Kitten heels are 1 inch or lower. 3 inches is a pretty standard heel height!
Why did zach sit on the ground to put on his heels when there was a couch next to him
as i girl i can say i prefer wearing thick heals because thin ones are harder to walk in and hurt my feet more after wearing/walking around them for a while
I absolutely loved Eugene's dancing
i wore 4/5 inch heels for  like 6 and a half hours......i regret everything
Zach looked great
Eugene dancing with that girl slAYED me
I just realized that this is how I look like when I walk in heels.
That's why when I'm older I will take all  the questions and WEAR CONVERSE AT RESTAURANTS!
Try guys try vaginas!
How tall is Zach?
When i was about 4 years old i pretended to be a catwalk model, so i used my mom's heels and walked up and down the stairs, which made me good at walking with high heels lol
the best series on buzzfeed have Asians. Ladylike, Try guys, Worth it, Unsolved
why did eugene do that
eugene and that girl were really into that dance
Eugene is my spirit animal I loveee him
okay eugene wore heels with a fake pregnant stomach
As always Eugene is so extra xD
i like wearing heels 😊
can we all just take a moment to look at Eugenes shirt 😍
Am I the only one who doesn't find heels hard to wear?
Zach loved the confidence of being taller, he should just get those dudes platform shoes.
I dont anything taller than 3inch, i wanna be able to walk and dance when I'm old☺️😘
In my head, I think I'm Eugene in heels. 

But in reality, I'm Ned in heels.
YES EUGENE
Keith doesn't really say anything about his fiancée 

Ned says "my wife" in every video
The same thing that happened to Ned happened to me. My heel got caught in the rail and I fell so hard the bar tender cut me off.I wasn't even drunk yet.
I think Ned is wearing the most comfortable ones, Eugine is wearing the least comfortable
Eugene and his DANCING LMFAOO
I still have problems wearing heels...
so true!!!!
Zachs shoes suited him so well... might be because he was so confident about them, but hotdamn...
Eugene is so extra!😂
As usual, Eugene had to be a whole level of extra... its getting kinda annoying actually...
The shoes are expensive hahaha
I loved them all in heels, but my favorite was Zach. He wore something that I would wear and something that I would love seeing men wear more often (obviously they can wear whatever they want, but holy molly it looks good)
Eugene is me on every level  XD "so when I was challenged to dance ...I motherfuckin danced " heels and murder weapons . So don't cheat or you see a pair coming for your head
here's the thing if you're over weight those heels hurt a loooooooooot more
lol Eugene looked miserable. Can def relate. Zack had the best time, kinda looked like a rocker.
When you thought that Eugene couldn't get any hotter
They put on heels and their inner divas come out 😂
It's just not Ned's day. xD I know that pain of jerks stepping on your toes, even with closed shoes people pull that one on me!

Can I just say Eugene has a bit of an extra challenge because his heels are too big at the back part of the shoe? That makes things even more painful. If your heel is too big, the back kind of grinds against the back of your foot with every step you take. And don't underestimate the dagger heels. My mom is known for being able to walk AND run in any kind of heels, and I showed her a picture of dagger heels once. She went 'NOPE'.

I swear, the man survived an entire night in freakin' DAGGER HEELS, with added pain of the wrong size. Give Eugene a round of applause! ...And some bandaids, for pete's sake.
why is Eugene so hot tho
lmao
"nope not wasted ..just wearing heels" 👐
My mom has the same Ankle Boots.
I quit smoking 2 years ago. My son was born, and I wanted to be a happy Father that didn't have any addictions, especially to life threatening things. I haven't picked up a cigarette in 2 years, and I thought I would feel happy again. Now this video gave me cancer anyway...
Zachs heels are sooo cute to me.
I'm pretty sure I'm in loooooove with Eugene, watching him salying on those stilettos is almost making me blush. He's AMAZING
zack please wear heels every time you go out.
Keith`s face at 5:39 lol
"Welcome to the real world." 
Ned: "I was catcalled." lol
Eugene will forever be my favorite try guy bc he 'eugenifies' everything
Honestly, never a more true video was ever made. But those guys made those shoes WERK!
All men should do this for one night. Also, we need more sexy shoes that are not high heels.
You can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels~Ned LMAO
at 5:25 they blur out the people's faces in the background but in 7:07... did anyone else notice that xD
Buzzfeed should make a compilation of every time Ned mentioned his wife; I would watch that
fuckin eugene goin hard
Eugene. is like a sexy girly anime guy, we all know guys from anime are all bi xD TOO HOOOTT
✨And of course Eugene look fabulous✨
I'm not new to Buzzfeed but I don't keep up with their videos. Can anyone help me to point who's who!?
The way they walked in the heels really triggered me XD
'Every inch of my being was screaming, "get out of these heels" ~Eugene 2k17
Eugene is so attractive. Stop existing
omg zach i have those ninja socks too <3
NEXT TRY GUYS TRY 4INCH PLATFORMS ❤❤❤❤❤
i want an episode of the crab try guys! #crabguys
Can tri guys do a collaboration with ladylike
YOU BETTER DANCE FOR YOUR LIFE!
LADY GAGA IS LITERALLY THE QUEEN OF HIGH HEELS! LIKE LOOK EM UP
ugh 
the girl that danced with Eugene..
i need to be her
Heels make you feel good, confident and utterly fantastic... for like an hour. After that all you want to do is murder somebody for the pain coming from your feet
I want Eugene's shirt! 😍
Watching this is so funny considering that my sister and I wore heels since we were like 4 or 6 years old. But props for them! They lasted longer than I expected.
I got to hand it to Eugene! I couldn't have survived an entire night in those heels and I wear heels quite often. :D
am i the only girl that can't even wear heels,  and doesnt like heels?
Eugene killed it ! HAHAHA
Sneakers all the way
block heel ankle boots are the wise choice, i can wear mine all day long without pain.
neds wife would get it
just pick a comfortable shoes ladies
I want zachs shoes they looked so comfy
Eugene gets more girls while wearing heels than anyone else I know, like damn can you please share your secrets with us? Shed us a little of light???
This is exactly how I feel about heels! I love them. They're so pretty but it hurts so much to wear them for longer than an hour.
beauty is pain
I feel like Eugene's just finding any excuse to wear heels, I mean come on, the drag video, this one, the motherhood video, etc....worst part is he rocks it better than any girl could.
next should be try guys try
  heal less shoes next
"and then he said 'welcome to the real world' ...OOHHHH!!" lmao
If they hurt so much, why would ANYONE wear them?!?!
Zack is the smartest , followed by kieth. The block heel and the kitten heel  would be easier to walk in than stilettos
Bruh I can go for a jog in all the heels they where wearing 😂
Eugene with the daggers YASS THEM MOVES QUEEN
is it just me or is Ned getting hotter and hotter?
Why is Eugene sexy in everything?
YES
I bring flats with me so that I can keep partying
"I might have done a mistake..but I look damn hot" that is why we war those spiky bastards on our legs anyway :D Tell me girls who can actually FEEL the feeling when they took off their HH and put on the flats?:D
90% of comments are of Eugene... I AM NAT SURPRISED HE IS SUCH A GOD! 😂 all of the guys are better at wearing heels than me... I am soo embarrassed of maself 😂
EUGANE IS MY SPRIT ANIMAL
9:51 👏👏👏
Ned has a good butt
trust eugene
Zach was wearing the easiest ones! I could run a mile in those and I dont even walk that well in heels
This is hilarious and made my night
"any advice for us?"
". . .don't"
Me too Ariel. ME. TOO.
Am I the only one who wants to have those boots !!!
Yep Eugene's a bottom
i love how the moment fashion comes in to any try guys video, Eugene just becomes the God of looking good
i cannot wear heals, they hurt my feet
Ned looks so good in these pants
I don't wear heels, but the ones that zach had on look cute and not too bad.. maybe I'll buy a pair.
Eugene actually looks amazing
Eugene's heels are obviously hade for a drag queen.
I wish I was that girl Eugene danced on that's a dream come true
"You got f*cking two entrees?"
"I was hungry!"
------------------------------------------
"No one can tell me what to eat in heels."
------------------------------------------
God Eugene you can step on me all you want
Keith has a fiancé? I didnt know hat 😅
I like Zack's the most. It actually suits him.
Eugene is such a g
Omg I want the Keith & Ned & Zack & Eugene shirt
omg!! love it so funny
Everyone except Eugene copped out. A 3 inch heel? An ankle boot? I mean most chicks don't wear stipper heels every weekend, but come on, those were probably the easiest choices.....
This is why I bring flats or flip flops in my purse!
6:10 gurrrl you got some moves 😂😂😂😂
I really liked Zack's heels 😂
Poor Ned
Of course Eugene could make a 6 inch heel look FABULOUS!!
I loooove Zach ankle boot...ITS PRETTYYY
I'm Ned in heels.
So silly! Eugene rocked it!
I thought keith was single!!!!!
Eugene looks so much hotter in heels than any other girls
zack looks real good in dos heals
Rip Eugenes feet
5:14 walking up to my social life be like
This is what happens to men when they vote for Hillary.
the thumbnail..what women would actually look like if we stop shaving every other day....
tbh zach looked hot in those heels he should get a pair for himself no joke
eugene can still walk in 6 inch heels better than me ffs
Eugene is fukin insane-
I wonder if this is how Ariana Grande feels. She's always in 6 inch heels lol
Ned can I have yo booty
eugene looks as hot as usual
Women complain about high heels but fun fact, you don't have to wear them.
Zach's heels are actually cute like can y'all tell us what brand it is?
I wore heels while dancing last weekend and I just got the feeling in my toes back today
better than expected
I LOVE ZACH'S BOOTS. HELL YEAH!
but daaamn that dance between eugene and the girl tho
I don’t understand how everyone says, “Yeah, they’re torture and bad for your feet, but damn, they make you look hot!” When I see someone in heels, I get creeped out. I know I’m not the only man on earth who is turned off by heels, but it sure feels like it.
Ariel looks so pretty!!!
Aaaand Eugene is killing it as usual
i wish guys would wear heels more often they look so good. especially zach.
I love u Eugene 😂😂😍😍😍
Why? Why is it popular to wear shoes that make you bleed and warp your feet? I refuse to wear heels nope
"i go outside, i stand by a dumpster, and i take off my heels"

love it haha
Eugene's "too much gene" is showing XD
bruno mars should watch this
2 to 3 bars a night? we don't even have that many bars in one town without driving half an hour
5:13 zach is just having the time of his life lmao
I'm so happy for Zach in this! He realised his most confident self and rocked it!
The try guys are so amazing! I love you guys the most of everything from buzzfeed! U totally made my day, I had an awful day and this made me smile🙂
Eugene got 100 times hotter in heels 🍸

I just learned something about myself today. Cis male with normal personalities? Boring. Metrosexual cis male that gives off a gender fluid vibe or can pull off queer fashion? Perfect.
I'm 10 and I can run in heels
Ned's hair looks fuckin great
My friends dared me to wear only heels to school for a week. I had to borrow my sisters heels, and gym class never felt better because I was forced to wear sneakers. I now can run, dance, and fight people in heels due to the dare.
okay so when i wear heels i literally only last from home to the bus station and im done with the heels...and those are literally 3 minutes..so respect to these men !!!!
And just like that Eugene came out the closet
Zachs shoes look amazing tho I want them
"He just said welcome to the real world..ohhhhhh"lmaoo
ahhh, i would love to see these fuckers wear pointe shoes xD
Ned in heels is like a woman on her period.
Honestly I feel like the worst part is when you get home and take them off. The throbbing, achy heel is death
It's not like buzzfeed has uploaded at least 3 videos about this already...
Isnt this repeated?
Eugene is my true spirit animal
Eugene just looks hot no matter what
This was incredible, God bless you guys 💕
I feel like Zach is rocking those ankle boots... Zach, you should get some men's heeled boots! Seriously!
I feel like Ned is secretly gay
Zack looked amazing! I want his outfit
these boots are made for walkin' 😏
I will never wear stilettos I'd constantly be thinking I'd break them
im crushing on Eugene but i dont think i could keep up with him hahaha
Bruh I'm 15 and I'm wearing those same 3 inch booties that Zach is wearing
the blonde girl looks a bit like vilde
get any blisters lol
work it Eugene
Benefits of being a tomboy-
No heels for me bitch!🙅
Zachs shoes are my choice for going out usually because theyre so comfortable and also look good
when Ned can be both a wife and a husband material
cute dog
damn Eugene you look good
why these guys' legs are more sexier than mine? ㅠㅜ
it's alr incredible that they don't get blisters behind their feet from new heels. O.o
That moment when guys look better than you in heels...seriously,  I walk like a newborn giraffe in those
Eugene is fierce af
Eugene is queen.
they should do a date night edition where they would wear heels tight dresses bras and put make up one
I love Eugene energy, he work every challenge until  he owns it
"I'm just trying to get home without a broken ankle"
the struggle is REAL
SO HOT
Now you know what society put us, women, through. Doesn't help that so many  women are so eager to put themselves through hours of pain and risk years of feet & back issues just to fit in or look good
eugene i cannot hahaha
They made these high heels work
I want to marry Zack! bring him to me! <3
Wearing heels and going between places = URBAN HIKING
i would rather were the ankle boot heels
It's really hard to wear high heels even you haven't wear it yet but to choose one pair of them.
Ah maaaan I love you guys so much :)
i laugh so hard to eugene hahhaha
They should've put on some more fabulous clothes for this experience!
"not wasted, just wearing heels" LITERALLY MY LIFE
'I may have made a terrible mistake... but I look hot'
 DAMN YES, YOU LOOK HOT AS HELL. EVEN MORE HOT THAN LEO VALDEZ
"Dinner is sitting and sitting is great "  basically my life
The hardest part is cheating: when you're sitting and easing off the heels for a moment of relief and then you have to stuff the blisters and blood back into the heels and walk again.
Eugene nailed it
Eugene is SOO attractive!! And when I saw him wearing these high sexy heels I was like OMFG!!!
Am I the only one thinking about Eugene's shirt?
ned is so hot, how am i noticing this just now
Zacks shoes are the only ones that I would consider. they would be so easy to walk in.
Eugene should totally wear heels some more
tbh their choice of heels rly did them in

save urselves... wedges are always an option
man down... lmao
No sh*t, guys. What did you think would happen? Good-ness.
Zack looked good lmao
I miss chianne pepper.....
Zack is the only one who showed heels I would actually wear out lol
Zack is so cute 😍
Zach actually really suited those heels also they were super cute
Zach's booties are the perfect shoes for using gel insoles. Extra padding makes more less pain. Oh & yes eventually heels cause foot damage over time. I donated most of my heels last year. I bought padded flat leather like shoes for $70. I wear them almost daily.
lol just wear platforms or chunky heals its so much easier
that feeling you get when you take of your heels and it feels like your feet are melting into the ground. Like somehow you are now a part of the floor.
"You can only see 4 of my toes"- Keith 

"Why do I have to paint al ten of my toe if you can only see like seven"- also Keith 

4+4=8
I s2g Zack is so cute
And as per usual Eugene out does everyone😂😂
Eugene looked effing HOT. Also, I loved all the shoes. And Zach and I wear the same size. I'm glad you got the shoes out of the dumpster because I was sad you'd thrown them away!
I totally think each of their choices of heels suited them really well :)
zack looks so cute
STOP PRESSURING ME TO GET YOUTUBE RED BUZZFEED I WONT DO IT
Yass Eugene ur so confident
Try guys wear bikinis on the beach
Try guys gone blonde for a week
Try guys start a band
Try guys become try girls
Try guys try naked oil wrestling
Try guys wear skirts
and many moree......
When you're a stripper and Eugene has better moves that you...
Should've got hit by that Rolls Royce's
I wore 11 cm heels at my gratuation & I'm usually already 175 cm tall... It was great though and I didn't even fall over:>
I wear heels often so I LOVED seeing these guys struggle in 3-6 inch heels. I can run in stilettos and I honestly found this to be hilarious.
ZACH LOOKS SO CUTE BUT HONESTLY I CANT EVEN WALK PROPERLY WITH AN INCH TALL SHOES. I'D SLIP MISERABLY ALL THE TIME.
Ned: What advice do you have for us?
Ariel: Don't 

😂😂😂
Eugene's heels are what I wear on pretty much a daily basis, I find them comfy
That moment when they walk better in heels then you do
this makes me feel better as the only girl in any girl squad that has to bring flats with her.
damn. eugene and zach should get themselves a girlfriend
I need Eugene's t-shirt.
But why the f would you torture yourself like that? 😂
How can men in old time wear this?
I'm tall, so I don't get to wear high heels. Yay. If I wore 6 inch heels, I would be 6'9, can you imagine a 6'9 girl walking around. I would scare small children, children, teenagers, adult men and women, and all of my friends because they're all 5'6 and under. Plus I'm scared of heights, ironic, isn't it??
I fuckin love you guys!!! 🖤
The amount of BOOTY in this video is highly appreciated
Mad respect guys!!!
Only Zack and Eugene 's heels looked good tbh
you could kill a man with eugene's heels
I LOVE THEM ALL BUT ESPECIALLY HIM
is it just me or Keith's feet are very neat and not manly at all HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAa.. he has a beautiful feet :)
No matter what we all have to agree Eugene won
2:14 to 2:20 Lol I love him
the try guys should o a thing were they llike where a full women outfit so like thos boob things and a bra and dress and makeup and there hair done for the same timeline as this:)
Heels were made by the devil, don't do that to your feet ladies
when I actually used to wear heels I'd take flats with me and switch to those between bars and when i was done with wearing them. it was very common to see me all dolled up in a nice dress dancing my arse off with flipflops on
WORK IT EUGENE! -2:30
That girl who danced on Eugene was legen-wait for it- DARY. LEGENDARY.
i still don't understand how women are able to walk
Zack was cheating and didn't even know it. Thick heels are mostly very comfortable, it's not nearly as harshly painful as thin long heels.
"Not wasted, just wearing heels"
Love the Try Guys!
I really ship Zach and Eugene ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
wow zach isnt the same quiet and shy guy anymore 😂😂
i  thought Eugene was kind of creepy that drunk :s his like ´´;))`` face when he danced w the girl :|
I love how eugene goes all out when it comes to smthing utterly uncomfortable
I love these guys
Zach's shoes looked sooooo good omg. Does anyone know where to get those, I genuinly want to know?
Oh come on zach gets a free ride with ankle boots
I love Eugene's shoes... where can I buy them?
image if man high heel was still a thing now
i can run in heels when im drunk.
2:31
Of course they'd choose those heels.

Zach wants the most stability.
Keith wants to show off all of himself. (Not in a snobbish way, don't worry. :P)
Ned would want to wear something his wife might.
Eugene wants to make himself the motherf***in' boss by giving himself the most torture.

The gist of it.
I always ways find it weird when people say heels are really high and impractical, but then I remember I dance on the tips of my toes with wooden pointe shoes.
"I look hot" no, you just look gay
Zach's shoes looked great to be honest. They suited him. Could be men's boots. shrug /Also all of their butts looked great. Ha.
I Wear HIGH HEELS Every Day & I Wear Flats Every Day. I Love Wearing Women's Shoes
4:20 when you spot GEORGE CLOONEY!
Hard to write every good quote from the video because every Try Guy is awesome!
becky is so pretty
Poor ariana grande, she does full performances in heels that big or bigger..
I've always wanted to stab someone with a stiletto just to test out its sharpness.
eugene grinding in heels made me feel some TYPE OF WAY
when eugene was dancing OOH BOIIIIII
I say Eugene looks good in everything, but when he walked he looked like a baby giraffe that's drunk off its mind
Zac
Thumbs up if keith and ned are couple goals
I'm only thought when they started putting on the shoes and walking, "I can barely stand in that shite and they can practically jog in them." I feel low key insulted. LMAO
"You got heels, that toosh has got the push"
Keith
For anyone that wants to wear heels like this and is not used to it, do it slowly. You're using completely different areas of your legs, butt and back to get around.
women do realize high heels aren't mandatory by law yes?
I'm seeing a trend of Eugene going the extra mile and hurting himself in the process..
Eugene!!!!!!
Poor Zach at the beginning. Hating how women make him look shorter. 😂Zach you are amazing even if you are not as tall as everyone else
2/700th comment
also eugene is so inspiring
zach is so sweet in this video tho
0_0 it really did bleed! I thought he was being sarcastic!
Neds wife looks exactly like Vilde from Skam 😲
omg I literally made that same bar crawl one night, every bar the same lol
Try doing pointe work. Then you'll cry
Eugene has daggers and is like sexy
Zach was the only one whose heels went with his outfit. I could see him wearing those more often!
When Eugene inner drag queen come out and he still look sexy
yey!!! I finally met becky!!! Im so curious about her when I watched the worth it house episode!
I want Zacs outfit!
Dude the ankle boots are the most comfortable
Eugene was like the Asian brendon urie
My feet hurt just watching this...
I'm trying to find the boots in the dumpster.
I need those six inch heels ❤ anyone know where they are from?!
Each pair of heels fits their personalities and outfits so well I love it
I would love to be taller. If you're tall you can wear flats all the time and look stunning. When you're short nobody notices you. I've never understood tall girls crying they can't wear heels because they would be taller then the guys. Well, you're still the ones they are noticing.
Zach is literally the smartest one out since he chose the ankle boot and not SIX INCH STILETTOS
EUGENE THO
if I was one of them I would be Zack. I love those shoes!
"I may have made a horrible mistake...but I look hot."
 -Eugene 2017
RIP Ned.
I could have sworn they already uploaded the exact same video with like the same lines months ago.. Im going insane, I need a nap.
those shoes just perfectly describe each of their personalities lol
"Pop that booty!! When you got heels, that tush has got the push." LMFAO
zak looks hotttttt why is he single
"they are lady gaga"
Eugene gets even hotter and even gayer every video I love him 😂😂
The heels describe them as people😂
Should have forced them to the "Date Night" menu. No bloating pizza for you Salad only!!! Can't have your pooch popping out of that LBD 😂😂😂
I may have made a mistake, but I look hot- Eugene 2017 quote of the year 😂
i just turned 13 can i get 13 likes :)
Ned is looking  soo good ❤❤
is eugene gay?
Zachs werent even proper heels
Of freaking course Eugene would wear the most difficult heels and smash it right out the park.

I swear they put  me to shame, I just look like I' trying to put up an awful circus balancing act in heels.
Mad cred guys
Eugene's would've felt a little more comfortable if it was the right size lol
i love how Eugene always goes the hardest
Zach look hot 😂😂
I love how they're all walking like satyrs 😂😂
Zack looked fabulous and pulled them off
The shoes Eugene wore look like the ones from the movie single white female that are used to stab someone on the eye.
I did not think Eugene could get any hotter uM
I wear heels to be tall because I'm only like 5 foot without them😂
i cant belive they threw the shoes in the bin wtf
I'm not drunk, I'm just wearing heels!
Is zac wearing an Adele T shirt  cause I brought one the same at her concert recently ❤
Lucky girl though.
Everything Zach said about competing with females in heels, YES. Even though I'm a said female myself (and don't face the same pressure to be tall like males do), I'm even shorter and can't compete even if I were to wear the highest heel. I truly feel like a little hobbit in a tall forest everytime I go to some function where there are loads of females in heels. It's frustrating and hurts my neck.  I usually don't wear heels as I value comfort and stability. 
So #PermanentArmpitSnifferforLife . Oh well.
zach looked so cool!!
I don't understand heels at all. They're impractical and they literally destroy your feet. Seriously, look at the high heels page on Wikipedia; people have been known to lose toes. And what if you suddenly have to run because you're being attacked or are in an emergency situation, you have to ditch them. What's wrong with a nice pair of flats or sneakers? Why can't people look or feel attractive while also comfortable at the same time? I don't get it.
I am very curious what that last bar that zach and eugene were at xD
When taking off heels after a long night...it is easily comparable to an orgasm
I watched and couldn't relate because I'm pretty much in heels always... all kinds. Six inch stilettos included. And the women saying they time themselves... I felt weird because that's pretty odd. I just pick a shoe. I wouldn't carry another pair unless I was altering the outfit for a different event
Yass Eugene yass
Eugene is so fabulous
That awkward moment when you've been to the same bars they're at 😂
ned is so pretty
takes off heels
orgasms
Eugene is my dream man
i would absolutely wear zachs entire outfit it was cute as hell
"My fiance, Becky, painted my tuh-nails"
Did anyone else think that the heels Zach wore looked really nice on him??
I have MAD respect for anyone that can run and/or dance in heels. I cannot wrap my mind around that one bit.
Zach definitely got the easiest shoes
Zach and Eugene looked amazing :0
WHEN NED THREW THE SHOES INTO THE DUMPSTER
Zach is super cute
Heals are not that bad if you know how to walk in them... heal to toe just like normal. If you walk on your tippies it's gonna hurt. Nothing worse than watching women walk like wounded animals.
We all knew eugene was going to love this
Ned was like every drunk girl during girls night
Something is telling me Eugene has danced in heels before behing closed doors😳
Eugene...gay.....looks hot being gay.....and he is a better dancer then me
eugene is so motherfuckin extra

and i love him for it
Dude they did this as drag queens
I never thought i'd see a stripper that wasn't Eugene in a BuzzFeed video.
Zach actually looked cute with the ankle boots
Zacks is the best
I love the try guys!!!
I'm only two minutes into this video, but I think this gonna be the one time Eugene doesn't win at something.
jealous of that girl dancing with Eugene.. am I the only one
I really don't like Eugene. He's too cocky and too obnoxious. Sorry fans.
I'm a size 12 in mens how did they find heels that fit them omg someone tell me where to find heels I want some like Ned's
YALL WAIT KEITH HAS NICE FEET THO IM SHOOK OMFG
Sorry for stepping on your toes man.
"They get taller, and I get shorter." Most relatable video with  your guys' significant comments 😭😭💀
Does wearing heels automatically make people want to drop it and twerk? Seems like they really liked doing that lel
Keith has super cute toes though.
4:47 great shirt Eugene
Before wearing high school:Pffftt,This is going to be easy,At the same time it'll fabulous on me.
After wearing high heels: internal screams from hell(high heels)
"When you drink it distracts you from the pain"....tell me about it..
I started wearing heels like Eugene's in middle school, in my family heels under 4 inches are unheard of. And Zach's heels totally don't count.
Awhhh Keith's engaged! Congrats!
Damn Eugene, get it!
"Who's that man walking down the street with those delicate feet     its ZACH!" LMAO 👍😹😂😅😆
"So when I was challenged to dance...I motherfuckin' danced."

Yassss! Eugene knows! No matter the pain or what else, that's the rule! 

P.S.
Getting your exposed toe stepped on is THE WORST!
Eugene is savage.
i on't even call ned's shoes high heels
If 2:33 isn't your favorite part 😂
Zack boots tho. Maybe he would love those elevator shoes that Tom Cruise supposedly wear all the time
Zack looked so hot oml
I don't understand why women wear heels. Inconvenient and, doesn't do anything but make you walk awkwardly.
I like how Eugene and Zach are hanging out more, Probably because Eugene and Ned are now aware they're the alphas.
I feel like if Eugene's heels weren't massively oversized he would have been able to walk a lot better lol
I'm so glad you made this video
"I may have made a horrible mistake. But I look hot"

Me using makeup.
Try guys do the athletics
OK but Zach's actually looked really good with his outfit??? Like if that was a silver zipper it would be perf
when i was little my older sister was in high school and all she her heels were like 6 inches high so i thought that was the height of basically all high heels. fortunately now i know that's far from the truth, but at least i can walk in them if i want to😂
but the shoes seem to encapsulate their personalities
I was watching the strippers in the back of the last bar 😝
I'm not even gay and I'd smash Eugene.
Eugene is an inspiration!!
The booties in this video!!! Eugene and Ned!!! So amazing. Now you know the power of heels for the booty.
Zach actually looked damn good in his ankle boots
eugene is insane. 6 inch heels all night?! he lasted longer than i ever would. the guy with the booties is a genius.
I put on my stilettos to watch this
I hate it when Eugene wears those and survives. I still slip even in sneakers lol
All i want is for eugene to step on me with those heels
All that crouching and leaning against surfaces, smh. Women wouldn't do that, no matter how high the pain levels are. And flating out is not an option either, one got to suffer at least till one is safely inside an uber.
Zach should wear ankle boots more often, he looked good! 😂
WHERE DID THEY GET SHOES THAT BIG? I have a giant foot I need to know ☹️ No woman's shoes feet me (I'm girl)
There is no way Eugene isn't gay
the 4,000th video
That's why i use my cute sneakers and stay at the club until 6am
if i'm going out, i ain't going home before the sun rises
The heels Zach wore looked sooo cute omg !! ( P.S i'm not a heel fanatic but i really liked those heels Zach wore)
I would pay to see all of Eugene's Dancing holy goddamn
That girl that danced with Eugene was lucky as hell
i mean zack
neds are the most comftorbale
I only wear the height of Eugene's nothing smaller maybe taller
Eugene=DADDY AF
😂 Rock like you mean it / love it / own it  😂
This is why I love Eugene. He just goes all out.
its hard to compete with 4 additional inches
Fabulous
Ok. But I want Zach's boots.
😂😂😂😂😂
I haven't laughed so hard in a while!!!!😂😂😂😂
Zach was the smartest one of the bunch. Too bad nobody chose wedges.
8:07 that was a damn strip club
EUGENE
6:42 was that a strip club?😂
Kim taehyung aka V even danced in heals in Star King lol
Eugene, you always go to the extreme! I'm surprised you lasted as long as you did in 6 inches!
how come they can walk in heels but i can't.
Honestly Zach looked so good, like that entire outfit was top notch
Becky and Ariel appreciation  post for supporting their try guys
Eugene. Always making me have a "I'm not gay, but..." thought.
eugene looked so good oh my god
this video was gay
Eugene is always so extra...
I love it.
Of course Eugene is all Go Big Or Go Home 😅
"I don't even care if I don't have flip flops!"
* throws heels in the dumpster * 
"we should grab those shoes tho they were expensive"
oui get it eugene😂😂💍💗
I love how Becky, Katie and Ariel are just chilling on the couch drinking what looks like rose
Eugene is too good when it's about female things. Sorry for all the 14- year old Eugene fans, but he is more of a she...
I have a Keith butt but I want a Ned butt
Your are on heels and do Asian squad lol
Zack actually walks the best, but Eugene looks the hottest. 
Zack I 💜 you
i want eugene tshirt!!!!
Ned turns me on so badly
Zach looks SO GOOD! I think he should wear those more often
Eugene was killing it in them heels on the dance floor.
Yaaaasss queen, slay!!
How is Zack struggling
Why does most of every try guys video's thumbnail show only Eugene in it? 
Shouldn't the other members get a chance too? Everybody needs to calm down about Eugene being the most dashing one among the 4. Zach, Keith and Ned also deserves to be in the thumbnail. They are pretty cool too.
This might be a small issue but hey it's called The try "GUYS" not try Eugene.
Eugene looks hot af
Eugene has dagger heels cause he slays all our hearts❤️😂😂
This is the gayest that I have seen of Eugene.
Sees video title: "Ehhh maybe not"

See Eugene slaying: "HELL YEAH. CLICKS SCREEN A MILLION TIMES."
i swear, Buzzfeed should release a compilation of Ned's butt.  lol
I knew Zach would last the longest because his heels were the most sensible. Seriously proud of Eugene for lasting that long in this six inch monstrosities though
the best feeling in the world is taking your heels off after a couple hours and running around on a cool floor
Zack killed it tho
Zach and Eugene low-key looked pretty good in them
Zach really suits those, damn
I'm 6'7'', and I'm not attractive. Women approach me all the time. I think it's a primal instinct of the female genome to attract to the dominant (Tall) male. Just like men are most attracted to short girls with large breasts and asses. Life is regulated by science.
I'd wear every bit of Zach's outfit
Damn Zack looked good in thosw
"I'm just trying to get home without a broken ankle."- The Ultimate Goal
I did drag on Halloween and wore heels. I had to take them off after not even an hour of taking my little cousins trick or treating. Idk how people do it
The assessment is holding out, Ned and Eugene still taking it up a notch.
i loved Zacks little song at the start
Ugh the "Welcome to the real world" guy. >:|
ariel can't even compete with ned,
Eugene plays too much omfg
Eugene 6ft tall with 6 inch heels Omg
I feel so uncomfortable not because it's men wearing heels but because those clothes DON'T go with those heels
I love Eugenes shirt, where can I buy one?
😖😖
02:32-02:33 EUGEEEEEN... THAT DEEP AND RISE IS SOOOO HOT!!!
Omg Keith's engaged OMG I'm so happy aide I love Keith
NED♡
Friend: What does extra mean?
Me: Shows clips of Eugene
No heels for me.
yasssss😍😍
damn eugene
God, that lucky girl dance with Eugene on a really sexually way.
Zach got the easiest heels to wear!!
Did anybody notice the random booty in the air at 8:10 💀😭😂
How does Eugene and Zac not have a girlfriend??? Like honestly I would date Zac
I met Eugene yesterday!!! My friends and i saw him at little tokyo and it was the best moment of my lifeeeeeeeeeee.
He almost got hit by a rolls Royce...I would have stood there
Trust Eugene to pick out the highest, most sexy and literally impossible heels to spend the night in.
IS THIS BAD THIS IS KINDA TURNING ME ON?!?😅😂😂😂
I see Eugene I click
bahahaha THIS IS GREAT! I'VE AGED OUT OF STILETTOS!
Eugene is so extra omg ❤️
I last about 30 minutes In heels before I'm in total agony. I don't have tall heels Most of them are about 1 inch but with ankle and knee problems added too that plus the fact that I need a lot of Arch support I just can't Wear them long. I'm a teen and I'm already falling apart XD
Next video:




$5 dollar heels vs $90,000 heels
Is Eugene gay or straight no judgmental just curious
I would wear zachs heals
Six inch heels...Eugene walked in the club like nobody's business
"I think I made a terrible mistake....but I look hot."
                                            -Eugene 2017
"welcome to the real world, oohhhh" sexiest voice ever
Try guys Work out in heels
You should do try guys cross dress for a day
Here's a tip for any girl who wants to be able to wear their heels for long periods of time. Tape your pointer and middle toe together, it will take a couple times of doing this for you to get use to it.
Fun fact though, men wore heels before women. It was regular fashion for the upper crust of the 1700's. All you're doing is calling back to those times. Good on you, guys.
They're asses looked amazing. Especially Ned.
Eugene's and Ned's legs look amazing 👌👌
a 9 minute video?

WE ARE NOT WORTHY
FAT HEELS PEOPLE. The only way to last the night
Zach did it best imo, but Eugene was a force to be reckoned with, especially with his dancing! Like daaaayum he's got skill.
YAY FOR NON BINARY FASHION
AND THEN EUGENE DID A DROP OMG IM DYING YOU GO GUYS AWESOME VID
Three inches is not high heel. At least four inches honey.
I LOVED ZACKS SHOES right❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When Zach did the drop omg cmu
Ned and Eugene have incredible legs!!!!
im 4'10 and so i guess it's easier to wear heels. cause i don't have the same problems that the girls are describing. like... at all. idk i'm just so comfortable in heels
Zach's boots are the only ones I could wear. I tried ones like Eugene's and couldn't make it out of my house.
Died laughing at Eugene doing in the Asian squat for comfort, at the end. My brotha.
Zach was the only smart one when choosing heels. Plus he picked a cute pair.
Leave it to Eugene to pick the hardest pair
I literally went jogging in six or seven inch heels once for a dare. I'm superwoman.
got to give Eugene props tho, he lasted longer in those ankle breakers than I would.
GO FROGS! 4:25 🐸💜
There all cute and funny in there own way
Ned's booty tho
Eugene, why are you wearing fetish heels, lol! They're not meant for casual wear, but for show.
Leave it to Eugene to go all out😂
Keith polish his toes nail????
Is Eugene wearing a Try guys T-shirt? XD
zach's liTTLE SONG ABOUT HIS FEET I CAN'T-
6:23 Lolol Eugene
ZACK IS TOTALLY DRESSED LIKE HARRY STYLES
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
Clock Stacey Q playing in the bar
Round 3 i was lmao
But I Make These High Heels Work🎵🎵
I wanna know where Zach got his ankle booties!! They were so cute with his outfit!!!
tip for all you women out there: the farther the heel from the toe, the more comfortable the shoe
I love wearing the heels that ned wore, there the most comfortable to me and I can go a night without much pain in them. & you guys should do like a race in high heels, either running or with bikes 😂
I hate heels
I want Zack's heels...
"that's a lady gaga" GET THAT PROMO KWEENNN
i think eugene is gay
Zachs ankle boots look hella cute with his out fit. Also funny enough i wore keiths heels to my middle school graduation xD
This is why I love Eugene.
I love you guys, but how was the message of this video "yeah, women aren't lying." Yeah DUH, women are not babies, men are not "tougher" than women. "My wife has a timer for a reason" . . . again, Of COURSE SHE DOES. You guys don't think so little of women... right? Maybe instead of a trite conclusion about women's justified pain in these shoes, question the social expectations women face and why they subject their bodies to so much pain to meet others (and their own) unnatural standard.
the only thoughts I had the entire video are "I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt,
But I make these high heels work" and "I'm so gay for Eugene rn"
I loved Zach's shoes xD
Lol of course Eugene has to be extra!
Eugene and Zac look so hot
I want Zachs shoes
Out of all of the heals I really liked Zachs most of all🙂 Eugenes were just way to tall
Zach's shoes are probs what I would wear if i had to be fancy
The only type of heels I wear are Zachs and that's only cause I'm only 4'11 and need the height lol, otherwise I hate heels nobody needs blisters. Wore them to a wedding once, never again.
Lmao I can run in heels.
anybody else think zach is the cutest thing ever?❤️
three inch heels? I wear those nearly every day to my classes
Eugene always kills me XD
"Sitting is great" my man :V
They walk Bette run heels than I ever could😂especially Eugene
Zach has it easiest, i always wear shose like that.
Brendon Urie would be proud.
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT BUT I MAKE THIS HIGH HEELS WORK
I saw Eugene and I clicked
"I may have made a terrible mistake, but I'm hot! "
-Eugene
but i make these high heels work
How did I know Eugene would wear 6 inch heels
Eugene looks fiiiiine as always
SOMEONE PLEASE GET EUGENE ONTO RUPAULS DRAG RACE HES A QUEEN
Why do people wear high heels?
Legs in the thumbnail disgusting.  I know you are a dude but please shave
Honestly Eugene looks hot in anything. If he wore a trash bag he'd still be hot af
Ok but Keith's fiancé is gorgeous
Eugene is basically the jungkook of the try guys
I can relate to that last cut.
EUGENE HIT THAT DROP IN THE BEGINNING THO
I'm saying this before watching the video and I got click baited because I saw Eugene in the thumbnail. I'm going to have full confidence that he's going to rock this challenge cause I've seen the man dance in high heels to a Beyoncé song.
They looked so damn good in heels
You guys should try the preheels thing, i'm like really curious about it working
of course Eugene's gonna go with the dagger heels. My man is a better woman than I am...than I will ever be.
didnt they already do this
6:23 Hot damn! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Eugene.... oh my god.... I don't think I have ever laughed so hard😂😂
eugene is actually my goals in life
V should be there...
Eugene in a bra:Looking Good
Eugene in a diaper:Looking Good
Eugene bald:Looking Good
Eugene in Heels:Looking GOOODDD
C'mon.
Let's face it.
Eugene looks good in everything.
I call them ankle breakers
i actually love heels so I was giggling the whole time LOL
Ned zack and kieth are all like three inches, four inches, and then Eugene comes out and is like sIX INCHES BABY
But you know...pointe shoes...
Ariel is an amazing woman
i wore 4 inch heel boots everyday my junior year of high school. i love heels but they are so painful
zach shoes is literally not that hard to catch on, eugene thou...
cant even walk 1minutes with that !!
I like Keith less and less. After being a jerk on Worth It... I actually feel more like he's laughing at people than with them. :/
SINCE WHEN WAS KEITH ENGAGED?
Zach looks hottter with them heels on
That Asian human is definitely gay
GO Eugene
In the beginning of the video when Eugene showed his heels, I was like "I've worn shoes like that and he's gonna wanna kill himself by the end of the night" and then he proved me right towards the end of the vid🙂😂
I....mother fuckin' danced!
What's the point of wearing high heels if they hurt?
Can someone please explain to me why people hate buzzfeed so much
2:33 LOL
Zach and Keith have it the easiest
Zach actually pulled of a look in those heels!
I was walking in the dark with a phone flashlight and I usually can see and I was also watching the vid and I saw Ned like being "man down" and I saw him take a step so I took a step and that's not where the actually step on where I was walking was and then I like tripped but I was laughing at Ned so much but then I was also laughing at myself falling so yea that just happened
3 gays Cucked
Zach is so hotttt
Honestly, Zach looked really good in those boots!
Zacks song after he puts on his heels was hilarious 😂
I love how each shoe represented the wearer.

 Eugene was dramatic and fierce.
 Zach was sensible.
 Keith was not too out there but still had a bit of flare.
 Ned was Ariel...10 years ago...
Find the difference:

Welcome to being a woman
damn Eugene is so good
Wearing an face mask and watching this isn't a good idea😂
society doesnt let men wear heels but it was men who started wearing heels before women back in like the 1500s 1600s i think one of those but its true look it up origin of high heels
Eugene: Lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt. But I make these high heels work!
HE SETS A TIMER OMG I CANT
How does Eugene look like a fricking god in everything?
"who's that man walking down the street with those delicate feet it's zach" 😂😂😂
This is what I subscribed to buzzfeed for
"So when I was challenged to dance......I motha fuckin danced" - Eugene 2K17
Eugene dancing in heels is the best thing ever, he looks so damn good
I'm a girl and I wouldn't last 2 minutes in 6 inch heels so YASSSS YOU GO EUGENE!!!
Eugene just come out!!!!!!
OMG I HAVE THAT NAIL POLISH ITS BY REVLON AND IT CALLED MIDNIGHT
tbh zach should really consider keeping those shoes cuz he looked really great just sayin

and of course eugene looked sexy af like duh but those heels were unreasonable XD
I loved this video so much, laughed so hard. I love the try guys
Zach looks amazing tbh
Zach looked really good...
MOTHERFUCKING EUGENE.
"I may have made a terrible mistake...but I look hot." 
poses awkwardly while trying not to fall

Same Eugene, same.
Soon video: the try guys turn into burnt toast
I wore 6 in stilettos for my All Hallows' Eve costume and had them on all school day and walked 5 miles in them to trick or treat in the historic district in my town...they are not bad. well not THAT bad.
Zachs boots look high key good on him
yeah, screw heels lol
Super jealous of Eugene, but not mad
It's understandable😌
But I make this high heels work
I want Zach's shoes.
Zach's shoes looked pretty alright for comfort.
And to think there was a time when guys wearing heels was normal
OMG a ladylike video, worth it video, and now a try guys video! I love sundays now!
How'd Eugene get a girl to dance with him and I can't even get a text back
Ned those aren't stilettos XD
The fact that their wives/fiances/lady friends were there made it that much better.
I admire their courage
i hate high hells
How is Zach single? I'm so confused
I can FEEL the pain they're in oml I sympathize so much, this is why I haven't worn heels in two years✌🏼
Tbh I think Zach pulled them off the best like if u agree😂👌🏻
Someone should have told them to walk heel to toe because that helps stabilize you. And when you are walking down stairs you lay one foot as flat as possible and then follow with your other foot. Not the side thing they were trying to do.
Ned's face when he says 'stepped on my toe' I'M DYINGGGGGG
Why is Eugene so hot!!
Eugene is hot.  That is all.
Zach Was Thee Smartest For Picking Those Heels They Are Wayy More Comfy
Eugene posture with those heels look like Him from the powerpuff girls im hollering
"Who's that man
walkin' down the street
with those delicate feet
it's Zach"
Boy are you running out of ideas
Me when I'm wearing my pointe shoes :)))
I will suggest this again, and probably more after this. You guys should totally try designing runway clothing and runway walking ( which is much simpler... You could do both in one episode).
They're better than me wearing those lol! How do people wear these on the daily like how?!
Oh god my heart just broke when they were throwing their heels on the dumpster!
At 2:32, Eugene looks better than all of us
Great now Ik that they look better in heels than I do 😂
Zach nailed it 👍👍
Most to least practical:
Most: Zach
Next: Keith 
Next: Ned 
Least: Eugene
I wore 5-6 inch heels on my prom night from 5 pm to 11pm and didn't not take them off untill I got home lol
Eugene dancing in six inch heels is my religion now
"I may have made a terrible mistake..."

silence

"...but I look hot..."
funniest thing.. heels were invented by men.
Ok, NGL... Kornfeld can rock the heeled bootie better than I can.
zach looks great on that boots actually
If I wear heels I wear shoes like the daggers
I'm a ballet dancer, I dance en pointe 
Go big or stay home, in used to the pain!!
I wear sneakers when I go out lol
poor eugene! but if any one of them could pull off the six inch stilettos it was always gonna be him.
ZAC HAD THE MOTHER F*****   COMFORTABLE HEELS IN THE VIDEO LIKE WTH
Before the video even started I just had a feeling they were going to give Eugene the highest heels
At 6:09 Eugene is drunk and is walking perfectly in heals. Lmao. He's strutting
Haha
If Eugene was Queer he would be the litist of lit, forget flamboyant he would be a Flaming-Masc.
omg eugene slays everything 😭😭
Who ran out of ideas? Buzzfeed. How much good series do they have? 1 and what series is it? Worth it.
Zach is the only one who did this right. Good job.
The try guys should try cut throat kitchen or chopped
Eugene is literally everything to me
Dancing Eugene is my favourite Eugene
I actually like heels, except everyone hates me wearing them because I'm already almost 6' foot 😂
8:05 That's not a bar, that's a strip club.
gay
watches this
remembers that I spent an entire day in heels just yesterday
remembers im 15
cries bc of the relatable of this video
Eugene looks so majestic
Oh, Keith's is Engaged? I never knew!
wtf is eugene wearing
Eugene should replace saf in ladylike because he's a better woman then all of us
I remember requesting the try guys to wear high heels in office for a week but this is good too! Thank youuuuuu! 😂
Eugene is a better dancer than I will ever be 😂
PATA SUCIAAAAA
oh my god those ankle boots were everything
Omg i love Eugene. he kills every challenge. When he got dancing omg it was so funny
Zach had the easy shoes ever
...The more I watch Try Guys videos, the bigger my crush on Ned gets. Seriously, Ariel, I'm happy for you.
Eugene's heels remind me of HIM from The Powerpuff Girls
that male stripper at 5:47
I saw Ariel and I said its Ned's wife she's so pretty.
is part of 0.0001% of females that loves heels
Only 3 inches?! Gtfo my face with that
My fiancé painted my tunaels
I honestly hope Eugene got that girls number bc they were such goals even if they were both wasted
Eugene wearing those muh-thuh f*ckin stilettos made my day lol
Am I the only person who noticed the car the almost ran Zach over was a Rolls-Royce?
i think we can all agree Eugene is a little gay 😂😘
🤣🤣 I LOVE EUGENE!!!!!
I wish this video featured Brendon Urie, he would make the try guys look like cavemen walking in stilts.
Eugene slays anything no matter what he is wearing
But I make these high heels work
Now they look ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!!!
I aspire to someday be as magnificent in heals as Eugene.
Eugene makes me rethink if I'm really a women smh
the boots ones are easy to walk in
I am pretty sure that there's a video where Eugene DANCES with stilettos on???
Eugene killing the heels game💯
God damn Id be sitting down drinking all night lol
Eugene looks good in fuckin everything
I love this 🤣 so sassy
I have Zach's ankles boots and they are INCREDIBLY comfortable. I wear them all day without a problem. Zack got really easy heels to wear.
Who else can like run in high heels I know I can anything over 4in I'm done for though.
There pinky toes will be screwed up
Lets be honest it wasn't the heels that made Eugene look even sexier its how he executed it with so much confidence.
Almost every single comment is about Eugene 😂
Ariel looks beautiful when she smiles :)
can I have zack' s shoes? we are the same size. i'm legit.
When Eugene dropped it I was like YAAAAAAASSSSS
try guys, can you try on weird runaway heels?
Zach actually looks really good, he should wear high heel boots all the time
Eugene heel look so hot!!!!
High heels were originally invented for men. Butchers would wear them to avoid stepping in blood. Women began to wear them to look more masculine so men decided to stop wearing them to avoid looking feminine. The more you know.
Why do girls wear heels so much if they universally agree that it's painful?
Eugene WOULD pick the hardest shoe to walk in hahahaha
6:20 is my favourite moment! He is so intense. lol.
Zack is such a cutie
I rather wear zack's lol tbh. Look for comfy
my dad walked behind me as Eugene was getting down with that girl and he was like "what on earth are you watching i do not understand the internet"
lol ppl think their all trans
try guys try to plan a wedding
They should try pointe shoes
Dude i dont know y but I want zach's heels so bad
Eugene you are hot no matter what!
Where do we find men like this!😂 lord they are so fun and cute
Do not read my name I beg you
confession: ive worn stilettos to school more than once
Eugene's and Zach's shoes, though 😍
I have those exact Journee booties Zach wore!
why do men seem to often work like velociraprors when they wear heels. XD
The try guys should do a week of women's beauty. Every day doing make up and hair, possibly shaving, night routines, etc.
YASSSS
I kind of envy girls who can wear heels. I have flat feet, meaning that even running shoes without proper arch support can really hurt after a while. Last time I tried to wear heels to an event, I gave up half way to the bus stop and went barefoot the entire day lol
Man everyone lookin fine
"But I make these high heels work" 😂😂😂
The secret to wearing heels without murdering your feet: get shoes. that don't hurt your feet. Surprise! They do exist. I have several pairs. They can be high.
...but I make these high heels work
Eugene is so hot
I'm a rather tall girl and wearing heels just makes me cranky and in pain. I'm tall enough so I like to be comfy/sexy and wear either heeled boots at most, or flats. I would not want to go home simply because my feet hurt.
every pair of shoes fit their personality 😂
Zach is the definition of adorable.
When Eugene dropped it like it's hot. OMG! Talk about slaying especially in six inch stilettos that are way too big for him.  Best video ever!!!
Me before Eugene puts on the heels: EUGENE NOOO!
Me after Eugene puts on heels: Eugene yes!!!
anyone else enjoy eugene as much as I did? lol
damn Eugene, rocking those daggers better than models.
Eugene's thot drop gave me life
Zach looked really good in his heel boots. He should keep wearing them.
this is why you carry fold-up  flats in your purse
Eugene rocks everything
Wait did that guy purposely step on Ned's foot tho? Wowww....
Keith's feet though. 💅🏻
Zack had the best shoes on, glad someone had a block heal rather than stiletto, feel sorry for Ed and Keith with toeless heals (instant blister maker).
Taking off heals is the best feeling
Y'all were at a strip club you can see a guy in his literal underwear at one part
Eugene killed those heels!!!!!
i almost never go out dancing or use heels.. let me tell u my little secret.. if you are going out use combat boots xD thats it. more confortable and your feet will be happy with you
zach should keep wearing those boots
queers.
Zacs books are actually quite comfortable.. I could wear mine all day!
my feet hurt watching this
Wait no hate but I thought Keith was gay...
Zack looks cute!
Zach honestly looked so hott
When someone asks how extra you are. Answer: Eugene.
Of coursed he liked it. He had the most comfortable possible pair of shoes. Wide heel enclosed boots. He sort of cheated.
There are few things as satisfying as making it through the whole night with heels and taking them off in the comfort of your own home
Honestly wedges are the best kinds of "heels." You have support and height.
MY SKIN IS CLEAR. MY CROPS ARE THRIVING. MY GRADES ARE UP. I HAVE 20/20 VISION I HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH EUGENE IN HEELS
Of course Eugene to hard core
"My fiance painted my t'nails"
Why are they using my legs for the thumbnail???
I love wearing platform stilettos, all of my heels are platform stilettos, the shortest pain I own are 5.5 inches and the tallest are 7
Eugene: And when I danced I mother fu** dance
Me: omg 😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Zach looks so good in those boots though. I love ankle boots. They're the only heels I can handle other than wedges and wedge sandals.
And this is why we love Eugene
Eugene always take an extra step idk why!!
of course they have Eugene on the thumbnail next to heels
Eugene be dropping low like it's nothing ....damn boy chill 😍
I had to ask myself. Why am I still subscribed to this channel..
Zach looks so good in his heels
Zach shoes are like the ones that harry styles wears so they're kinda unisex
Hold on the try guys aren't the producers of try guys? They have Katy? I always thought they produced their own videos
LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT! BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK😂😂
Omg. Eugene at 7:48 though. He's in distress, but dang, it's gotta be a crime to look that good.
Eugene just went HELL YEA when he danced with that girl! I loved it! he always does extra.
Zach's shoes aren't fair because they would be so comfortable.
6:43-strip club
They went to a strip club
I own the shoes zach is wearing
The worst is when you find a good place to take off your shoes because of the pain but when you finally have to leave and put them back on, you want to cry!
I'm 5'0 and I HATE heels because I walk like an idiot in them but this video makes me want to wear heels... what kind of sorcery is this?
Zachs outfit was AMAZING
I cringed when Ned and Keith were walking barefoot in the alley. I have puked behind those exact dumpsters on occasion.
Eugene's shoes were too big 😂
Eugine works it better than most girls
At the time around 8:15 you just casually see strippers in the background
Zach or however you spell his name, took the right choice
Zach looked great! and had the most functional footwear
Try pole vaulting
Shout out to all the ladies out there who wear heels on a daily
How do you get youtube red for free???!
That tush got A PUSH
Omg they're sooo funny
I like Ned, but he has a terrible taste.
Eugene is sexy asf
6 inch heeeeels, eugene walked in the club like nobody's business, God damnnn she murdered everybody and I was her witness
I can run in heels 030
I wear 6 inch platform heals and there pretty comfy
Why is Eugene so extra?
Eugene low key won tho 😂😂
they look....FABULOUS!
I wonder how big their feet are? Mine are pretty big and I can never find girl-shoes. I tried yo find some when I came to the US but nothing. I just have some shoes from the UK which I use all the time. 
Though I really don't wear them often. Only if I'm gonna be sitting a lot. I've taken them off to walk around the place barefoot enough not to repeat the mistake!
what was that last bar?
Those boots really work for Zach!! He should keep wearing those!
so much respect for eugene now 😅❤️❤️
The Try Guys lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but they make those high heels work.
Hands down, funniest one yet😂😂😂
"I think I made a mistake ._." .... "Atleast I look hot"

😂😂😂
dont lie we all wanted to be that girl who got down with Eugene
Zach had the best choice but Eugene impressed me with his stamina
This is so funny
Eugene did so well!!! A 6in pump that are too big and more than 2 hours? Wth he makes a better heel wearer than me. Mine are like 4in pumps a little bigger and I am down in an hour plus. I just dance standing where I am.
I STARTED CRY AT 2:32 WHEN EUGENE DID THAT I LOVE HIM
The guy who kept saying he looked hot, but no lady who's bull leggie looks hot, sorry dude.
THAT DROP THO. EUGENE IS THE EPITOME OF SEXY.
I have these 6 inches heels. yeah, wore them once and then never again. they are just sitting in the back of my closet away from light
I like zach's shoes
i tried dagger heals before.....and i fell twice in 1 minute.
zack looked good!
Eugene is my favorite
YAS EUGENE GO BIG OR GO HOME
I love Eugene 😍😍😍
O my, Eugene looks sexy in everything
sees Eugene's shoe
plays Beyoncé's 6 inch
LMAOOOOOO WHEN EUGENE DROPPED IT LOW😂😂😂😂😂
I wanna see them try show choir.
With heels. 
Feel our pain.
I NEED those dagger heels
The shoes basically introduced every kind of girl you will meet. 

Eugene's dancing though... it would make a hooker blush. OMG!! ❤
Eugene made it work so good
Keith and Eugene are the best
PAUSE AT 6:26...WOW!
Am I the only one who keep a pair of flats in my car and/or purse?
Hasn't this already been done?


BY BUZZFEED??
the ankle boots don't count
Heels Kills ... Just don't. 😂
Okay, but when Eugene dropped it like it's hot! Pretty sure I rewatched it like 20 times.
you guys walk like aliens from district 9
I feel you Eugene. Every night I go out is like the one you had. Feeling sexy af. Dancing your heart out, walking realy awkwardly, and at the end just not feeling so much aches that you're just not happy any more. It takes some time to get used to walking in six inch heels, but all my friends are literaly a head or one and half head taller then me. And it hurts my neck more if I have to look up the entire night, then it hurts my feet to walk in heels the entire night. The strangest feeling is definetly walking after you've taken them off. Also: never ever take off your high heels and walk/rest and then put them back on. That hurts even more then keeping them on!!
Best part of wearing heels is taking them off and feeling the blood rush back into your feet.
"They're very special torture devices to make women move very slowly" - Eugene, The Try Guys Try Drag
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt. But I make these high heels work
Eugene shole did mutha fuckin' dance!
Es lo mejor que he visto en mi puta vida 😂😂😂😂
I couldn't wear heels bc I'm 6'6 and I like being able to barely walk under doors
Zack is extraaaaa
"I've may of made a terrible mistake, but I look hot." Eugene 2017
Zach was the only person smart about it
Zach's shoes were cute and sexy and therefore the only ones I would wear. But Eugene wasn't kidding. He was on FIRE in those heels (in more ways than one).
Zach's boot shoes were actually so ring I wear everyday!
"eugene got down harder than I have ever seen a man get down" I LOVE
"My fiancé painted my tunails" 😂
Zach looks so hot.
damn eugene dances soo good lol
Damn, I think I like men in heels
I love zack's shoes!!
Ned should never wear anything that isnt white pants
Eugene is the definition of YAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSS. I live.
I feel like no one's is asking but, where did Eugene get that shirt? did they make a line of clothing?
I gotta say heels are worse than bras
this is going to hurt
is ujean?? gay?
Zach's shoes were adorable
IM DYING THIS IS EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED
I love watching y'all try female stuff.
omg you are all amazing but Eugene SLAYED MY LIFE with his dancing I am deceased
Why do people wear heels if they hurt so much? I love heels and they don't hurt me, but I wouldn't wear them if they were unbearable lol
I love Zach's heels 😫💖 I want them
But I would also wear Zach's entire outfit? Haha
I wore heels to my church communion. I tripped halfway through but no one noticed XD
Lol so good lol. 😂
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSS I just wish they wore platform heels
Eugene can wear heels better than me, and I'm a girl.
I want to be as confident as Eugene
Eugene is just slaying the game!he's slaying my life! he's slaying the universe! 😭❤😍🍑
"But I make these high heels work"-Brendon Urie
Lmao awesome
boots are the most comfortable
1. EUGENE HOLY HELL
2. Yes, welcome. Now you have learned that after a long night, taking off heels is sometimes better than an orgasm
What feminist made this crap men do way harder stuff I'm in life that women
OMFG EUGENE I LOVE YOU
I wish I could dance like eugene 😂
very angry
Zach and Eugene definitely got the best shoes. Should've let Zach wear Eugene's shoes tho I would be super excited to see that lolll
6:06
next try guys try gay sex.
we get it, you want to emphasize all of the little things to make it look like women have it 1000x harder then men. move on to another topic... I could have gotten this from 100 other of your vidoes
I'm a simple girl. I see Try Guys and I click x)
wow looking for any excuse to be a tranny huh.
This is why I never wear high heels... or pointy shoes for that matter
These guys looking like a straight up SNACK
that video was so funny.
"no less than 7 inches" -isabelle lightwood, the mortal instruments
I like Zach's
"My fiancee painted my tunails"
Where can I get Eugene's shirt that says all of their names, I NEED IT
I can't wear heels and I'm a teenage girl
Eugene got the hot heels
I always wondered what Eugene's job was before he joined BuzzFeed...... now I know. He was a stripper. Definitely.
Oh come onn, those ankle boots aren't real heels 😂
Eugene you're such a babe i can't deal 😍
5:46

Eugene why
Alright, let's talk about those pole dancers
Eugene is the only one who really experienced a night out in heels
ned isnt wearing stilettos?
eugene walks like hes on the runway
omg that hole on the floor.
Zach's shoes were the easiest and most comfortable to wear.
i really want zach's shoes tho! legit where did he get them? lmao
I thought this was done before?
oh lord i love them all so much more already
Zach needs to go out with the girl in the middle
I need a Eugene appreciation video, dat guy 😍
I liked Zach's shoes better. I'm entitled to my own opinion so no negativity.
I bet Zach will still use those heels from time to time
Ugh Eugene is just so dang extra
Zach's so adorable
0:26
Looks like the bar from don't threaten me with a good time
Damn neds legs look great in heels XD
Am I the only person that finds Keith annoying
So does Eugene have a boyfriend orrr?
Eugene is the Asian version of Beyoncé
I like zach's shoes so much
Ariel looks so pretty
They should try point ballet it hurts way worse!! 😂
I'm 11 and I can walk really fast 




not trying to be bragging
Every try guys episode has one thing in common....Ned talking about his wife ;)
I don't get fashion. If I wore a heel "from 10 years ago" what kind of person does that make me? Horrible? Idiot? Ugh this annoys me. I get so worked up over the stupidest things.
Eugene is so perfect Jesus 😍
I love how the heels match each guys personality!
Honestly, the ankle boots looked really good on Zach. Am I the only one that thinks men would look good af wearing those?
eugene went ham zach's shoes are shoes i want the most i can do is 4.5" platforms for two hours
Damn, Eugene, I knew you could dance but DAMN.

Also, as a short person, I love six inch heels but boy does that love only last two hours max unless I'm sitting for a majority of the time out. You had a death wish, Eugene, but congrats on making it almost completely through the night!
2:19 SIX INCH HEELS SHE WALKED IN THE CLUB LIKE IT WAS NOBODYS BUSINESS. GODDAMN SHE MURDERED EVERYBODY AND I WAS HER WITNESS.
I'm living for Zach's shoes
I'd where Zach's
Eugene's dancing was amazing
does anyone know where Zach's boots were from?
My prom shoes were taller than Eugene's, they had a wedge on the front and dagger heel. I danced and jumped and ran all night and surprisingly didn't hurt. I'll probably never wear my prom shoes again unless I want to look taller and look scary badass (I was the alternative girl at school and still am)
I can wear stilettos for maybe 7 hours before they get uncomfortable but a chunky heel I can wear al, day
Okay but id wear Eugenes shoes
2:32 Damn Eugene 😏🙌🍑💦😍
Guys, you do realize that high heels were invented by the Persian military to keep the archers in the saddle while they fired arrows upon the enemy. We women later on stole them to look more 'masculine'.
I think the guy with the black boot ones will last the longest because those are the most comfortable or at least that's what I think
dude 2:33 i love it
"But I make these high heels work"
WHY IS EUGENE SO EFFING HOT
Honestly need those black ankle booties😍
Zach's shoes were definitely the most practical
Everyone loves Eugene!!!!!! 😍😍😍
This vid proved that Zack is the smartest 😂😂😂
I think we can all admit that the real winner was Eugene. 6" is A LOT!!!!!! Plus he gets extra points for those moves 😂
Eugene is so fuckin extra and I LOVE IT!
Me and my friend are watching this together. Before that we were watching a puppy play video on YouTube because it just popped out. So right now she wants you (The try guys) to try puppy playing. Just requesting.
That's why I don't wear heals. Also I'm 5'9 and don't need then
Zach's heels were GORGEOUSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
The worst part about wearing heels is when you take them off and your feet hurt even more because they haven't been flat for so long - they're almost moulded to the high arch. I wear what Zach wore for like 8 hours a day, he definitely had the best pair to party in.
6:10 EUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENE
Haha, I'm loving the reactions of the nighttime citizens of WeHo here!
When 4 straigh guys wear high heels before you (and you are gay) XD
Eugene: "I look hot"
Me: "yes you are dammit" sobs
Men look so good in heels! I wish it was more socially exceptable :(
Eugene, marry me.
I've worn heels far longer than four hours and walked farther than a mile. it's all about the heel you choose & breaking them in the day before.
Eugene's shirt😂😍
You almost got hit by a rolls Royce
i can hear raven booting the ankle straps in the distance
Is Eugene gay?
When you wear 4 inch heels everyday.......
When Ned got "cat called "?¿ when was that ? I don't really think being told " welcome to the real world " a cat call
this just drilled it further into my brain to never wear heels. I did once when I was like 8-10 somewhere around that, and I will never do it again. Converse for me all the way
I would wear zach's heels because it looks the most comfortable
Zach's look pretty comfy tbh
Yeah..... heels are evil.... but they do look so damn good. I've sworn off them and choose comfort. I will rock the dress with sneaks... or combat boots.
zach could get those an inch shorter and wear it around and it wouldn't look bad
zach's shoes are wow
i want these 😍😍😂
they need to do the boob weights and heels at the same time,  with club clothes to get the full experience.
Yo zack was smart to get the thick heels boots. Heels with comfort that last longer and doesn't make you look like you have a drinking problem
Eugene dancing 😂😏😍
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eugene would really make it as a drag queen, like bih... those dance moves... I got my LIFE
Eugene had to be extra with those six inch heels. they were cute tho
Eugene's heels look too big. huge mistake Eugene. heels must fit well
Huh..........The only real kinda series on Buzzfeed that isn't man hating
EUGENE WORKS THOSE HEELS!!!
They all looked hot in those heels
instinctive squats lol
My ankle is currently swollen... this is painful to watch
I love zacks heels
Why does Ned have me weak  asf
I wonder if they lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, cause they're makin these high heels work.
"So when I was challenged to dance, I motherfucking danced." -Eugene 

SO INSPIRING.
-You got two entrees?!
-I WAS HUNGRY
OMG! Keith got engaged?! Congrats :D
Zach... WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE SHOES😍
I LOVE EUGENE. WE ALL NEED A EUGENE IN OUR LIVES.
Zack made the safest choice
eugene why did that turn me on
Eugene is so cute😍
Eugene's inner drag queen came out.
I hope they realize that heels were litteraly used as torture devices.
Wow this is great
Heels were made for men, not women
The shoes really resembled who they are
I want Zach's  shoes....
Ned has held the Guinness world record of mentioning his wife everyday of his life.
me when he pulled out the dagger heels: oh no XD I feel like he might fall
i put a dislike because you could do other stuff with your life I mean understand you try to portray how men force women to put on high heels and it's called invisible violence but common...
I NEED the boots Zach is wearing. They're so cute.
Eugene looks HAWT IN LITERALLY EVERTHYING!!
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
Zachs were the best, and does anyone else notice how Eugene always has to go bigger than everyone else, like he's over compensating for something,  lmao.
My favorite thing about taking off heel after a while is being able to pop your toes
I applaud them bc I can't walk in heels at all
"but i look hot" you bet you do eugene, you work those heels!
Eugene had to be extra 😂
Im confusingly attracted to all the try guys now
who is Moroccan here and noticed the tajine ;)
I lost a bet to a guy in a Chiffon skirt
But I make these high heels work
I told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
Good thing Im 10
What the * are you doing Eugene?!
LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT.
BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK
Keith's finance is gorgeous
Eugene is my favourite person ever.
Eugene looks so bow legged in those lol
they should wear a small bra, high heels, a tight dress or a dress so long u step on it all the time and a full face of makeup
Eugene for real gave me a boner.
Eugene slaying as always
want zach´s boots
Eugenes so extra hes the best
not trying to sound rude but why do people think Eugene is so hot ? he's a good looking guy but why do people exaggerate ?
Am I the only one who thinks they should all be professional strippers or drag queens
You guys are wrong. Even when you don't have heels you guys are hot af.
Damn Keith that pop tho
don't get me started with Taehyung dancing with high heels
eugene 🍑
SLAY EUGENE !!!!
Lol you can't tell me what to eat when I'm wearing heels 😂😂😂😂😂
Zach should keep those fr
Zach singing, lmaoo😂
where is the part where Eugene flats out?? that was the reaction I was most exited to see!!! please share his reaction face!!
Eugene dear nice moves ;)
Eugene!!!!!! your  hair is gone OMG I loved the hair before
I think Eugene and Ned got catcalled a lot that night lol
Although Eugene flat out, he pretty much won lol Zach's heels don't really count as heels lol they count as everyday shoes....walking in 6in stilettos...I give you mad props Eugene!
Keith has a fiancé 😰
Is Eugene straight ? Just totally curious, no hate :)
Eugene is so amazing
they make those high heels work
their legs look better than mine
Eugene bend and snapped like a pro
these guys are so cute and fun , I hope that my future husband is as cool as these guys😘
I only last maybe two hours in normal heels. I wouldn't even last four hours in heels
like I would totally wear Zach's whole outfit hmu
Eugene looks good in literally everything...... he could wear a garbage bag and rock it
Zac and Keith wussed out with their heels and Keith's feet and fugly! 😆
"I might have made a mistake... but I look hot" me when I'm drunk on apple cider
Yas Eugene actually more than a kitten heel👏🏻🙌🏻👠🙌🏻
Eugene is so cute daaaamn
the whole time im thinking DAYUM EUGENE
EUGENES SHOES WERE WAY TOO BIG. those shoes are expert level heels when they fit, but when they too big, thats impossible and also torture
Zach, most sensible try guy <3
I like Zach's shoes they look so comfortable
I know it's dangerous but I want them to try pointe shoes for a day
I love that the guys don't feel emasculated by doing things like this. This is so cool and they don't seem to give af about what people might say. SLAYYYY TRYGUYS
Eugenes hangover voice at the end hahahahaha
4000th video on this channel
My school shoes had a tiny heel on it and i fell over in them. I cant wear high heels coz ill probably break my ankles 😂
I felt the pain 😢
OMG EUGENE DANG BOI
Hence I wear riding boots or wedges. I left stilettos,pumps anything like that in the dust back in middle school. As a women in university, I will be damned if shoes are the reason I can't go out👠🚫👢✔😎
I am crying... this is SO FUNNY
That part when Eugene dropped it low, HOOWOWOWWOWOWOWOWOWO WHERE CAN I SIGH UP!?
My mom is a shoe designer

Joyce Echols
Is it weird I can run better then I can walk in heels.
zach made the BEST decision
"I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but I make these high heels work"
6 inches are reeeeally hard to walk on. The hardest actually.
Ned kinda reminds me of Katya 😂😂
Eugene always goes hard. ❤️  Love stilettos. It was always hard for me to find stilettos over 4 inches.
if you need to learn to wear heels talk to dr. frankenfurtur
Eugene cares sooo much about what other people think!! it's so annoying, always trying to impress others. Who cares what others think?? just be yourself man!
Zach is an adult version of adam golberg from the goldbergs tv show
I don't care how good those shoes look. If they make your feet actually bleed. nope.
Keith really doesn't need to get taller.
eugene killed it pls
Try Guys, Ladylike and Worth It all in one day!!!!! Buzzfeed on firee <3
I thought Eugine would have a dress on
I am a girl and I never wore 6 inches of heels 👠😒😒😒
YOU GUYS WE FINALLY MET KIETH'S FIANCEE
Wait what does eugenes shirt say ?
Ned's wife is sooooo beautiful. Keith's fianceé is, too.
I hope this video motivates dudes who've always wanted to wear heels in public do it✨ even though none of them role that way they look pretty good in them!
Is it just me or are gugene's legs look sexier
Eugene looks fine with high heels👌
Yeah, this video has reaffirmed why I almost never wear heels...
I want dagger pumps now
Lol Eugene is just like, beauty is pain you gotta do what you gotta do
How did Eugene last a whole night in those
I can't even wear those for 5 min
Good shoes bring you to good places...😂😂😂😂😂
Y'all know and aware that Eugene is gay, right? he's a fabulous one! 😁 no seriously, he's gay. 😊
Zach played it safe, Neds rocking it, Keith is both shocked and a natural, Eugene has no idea what he signed up for.
it was no surprise that eugene chose the most extreme heels. also i want zach's outfit in my size it was cute
Zach's shoes aren't that far fetched as a normal unisex boot. Very reminiscent of Harry Styles. If I'd seen him out and about in those shoes I wouldn't think they were heels at all.
Why does eugene look amazing in everything
I feel like Zach looks super casual like a natural
if women hate wearing heels sm, stop wearing them?
holy sht Eugene LMAO he is TURNT
Oh my gosh Eugene is so badass
am I the only one who thinks heels are easy to wear and walk in?
YAY MORE TRY GUYS
Dem noice legs
Wonder if Eugene got the girl he danced with number
Zach's shoes are nothing, I wear heels higher than that everyday
I want Eugene's Try Guy shirt!!!!
Its actually pretty unfair for Ned, Keith, and Eugene.. Its like Zach's heels is more comfortable and not that hard to walk on. I actually had that heels and i always wear it.. Zack should be trying the heels that Ned and Keith is wearing so it will be fair. But damn Eugene.. Why is he more sexy than i am? :(
I'm actually surprised Eugene lasted that long, those are some extreme heels, especially for beginners. Man i respect him
I fell like Zach had a More easy heel because it wraps around his whole foot
Zach, making the only good decisions as always
Eugene needs to give me those heels right now. I am LIVING.
"But I make these high heels work"
6 Inch heels, Eugene walked in the club like nobody's business, goddamn, he murdered everybody and I was his witness
zach was smart choosing the boots
I just want Becky and Ariel to be BFFS.
whoever edited this video is in love w ned's butt and im not complaining
i think i have a thing for eugene in dagger heels now tHANKS A LOT
Zach's went really well with his outfit
I wear Zachs heels like every day for hours and I live in nyc
Spike heels are evil.
Zachs shoes were sooo pretty
do The Try Guys wear Platform shoes next !
Ok let's not lie, Zach totally won this
in love with Zacks heels
Thay should do people become vegetarian 's for a week
Zach looks hella like the shoes go with his outfit and he looks gr8
Bless eugene my best stilettos are 6.1 inches and I've made an uber take me for 2 blocks before
Eugene is hot with or worhout his heels
Eugene HAS to be gay
welcome gentleman to the dark side! Taking off heels, stockings, bras, and makeup IS LIBERATING SOOOO MUCH OMG! oh, and weaves lol. and to think that Beyonce and Lady Gaga wears all of that for entire concerts!
Heels were originally made for men and women only wore them to be like a man
I honestly wished "Don't threaten me with a good time" played I hope someone understands that reference 😂
AHAHAHA EUGENE XD
Eugene basically was Cheyenne Pepper that night
i wore 3 inch heels foor a whole day at age 14 at a convention
i thought they already did this video?
2:31 God damn.
it's showing 8 toes if it's hiding your baby toes....not 7
sees legs in thumbnail Dammit Zack...(I was guessing)
Y'all did this already.
Eugene is so hot 😍
see how tough girls are
tbh i don't even doubt eugene looks good in everything anymore, he could shave his head and bleach his eyebrows and idk wear 4-sizes-bigger shoes, he'd still look hot. also, zach's high heels looked gooooood in him omg
Why? Because Eugene, that's why.
Ankle boots were the smart choice
ZACH YOU SHOULD WEAR INSOLES :D
I just realized Zach's heels actually really work with his look, and he should totally wear those regularly. 

Just sayin.
I think all guys should experience this haha
eugenes dancing  😍
Loooove this vid
i love how most of them are wearing 3 or 4 inch heels, which i wore when i was twelve, and eugene goes for six inches
I cant unsee what i just saw
"Who's that man walking down the street with the delicate feet?"
The Try Guys is the only reason I still watch BuzzFeed
Eugene is so extra and we love it
Neds butt is 11/10
Kieths Tall legs are model material
Of course Eugene is the one who does the absolute most
6:10 thank me later
and what are you supposed to do if you live in the UK where YouTube red doesn't work
Zach was the only smart one
"lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt but I make these high heels work" - bebo
Welcome to the world of women!!!  I don't wear them unless I have to.....but they do make you look good!!  haven't worn heels in almost a year...won't be wearing them again until August for my high school reunion.....love the guys when they do these things!  and I LOVE ZACH!!!!!  i'm to old for him but damn he's cute!
There's nothing worse than wearing loose stilettos 😂😭
Eugene got DOWN.
I am Eugene
2:30 😂😂 slay
Keith's heels can't be a kitten heel if it's three inches. Kitten heels are an inch or so.
"Dinner is sitting, sitting is great" 

My new motto
Zach must've been overreacting or just faking it because those shoes are wayyy more comfortable idek why they let him wear those
God Eugene is extremely attractive
The car that almost hit Zach was a Rolls-Royce Ghost Series 1.
Eugene's heels looked like at least half a size too big. That plus 6 inches equals a lot of unnecessary extra pain lol.
I have a 8 inch stilleto and it is hard af now you know how it fells
And this is why I think heels are an oppression device. Sorry, fashion.
that thumbnail tho
I think I have all of those shoes (or just really similar ones) :D
I honestly envy how hot Eugene looks in everything
Zach and Eugene tho
2:32 DAAAANG BOY, TEACH ME YOUR MOVES BC YOU LOOK HOT AF.
More videos that aren't on redtube please!
zachs are a thicker heel hes fine
ZACK LOOKS SO FREAKING  GOOD IN THOSE 👠!!!
Omg i totally agree with the problem of feeling like a burden because you wanna leave halfway through the night because your feet are basically bleeding 🙃🙃
Eugene and zack looked A1 in their heels 😍💕😂
I'm just really curious to know if Eugene or Zach would ever wear those shoes again for another night out. Anyway, this was great.
"I may have made a terrible mistake.....but I look hot"
RELATABLE
Am I the only girl who wears heels and doesn't hurt my feet.
I can't even breath in heels wtf
KEITH PROPOSED??????
eugene and zack looked so good in their heels, hot damn
I want the shoes Zach was wearing
Zack had it so easy ! His heels were chunky
Ugene and Ned actually looked good. Like dayum. 😏😂
Eugene, ALWAYS has to go big or go home. SMDH
eugene is gay?
Zach if you like them and they're comfortable, wear the f**ck out of them boo
1:00 I LOVE ZACH

also i want those shoes
When does YouTube red come to the uk.
Why are Keith's toes nicer than mine
eugene is my aesthetic
I like Eugene 's shirt
GO ZACH!!!!!!!!!
I see Eugene...I click
zachs heels are cute i would uy them
becky is so cute omg
I wish I was a try guy.
WHEN EUGENE DID THAT BODY ROLL THO OOOOH. zach also looks super super good in those boots
I think the only smart ones were zach and Keith. What the hell is Eugene thinking!!
I wear heels higher than Zach's on a daily basis hahaha.
Wtf was up with that "welcome to the real world" guy????
damn son that's some hella toned legs you got there
after the video, did anyone else go back to see Eugene's dancing?
Eugene is like: "Drop it like it's hot."
Heels have soooooo many health risks when it comes to your feet
YOU HAVE DESCRIBED MY LIFE!!!!! I gave up on heels and wear platform sneakers now, still got the hight (super short) and I feel great but super comfy and I party all night
'i lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but I make these high heels work'
... This is me every day... I feel you guys <3 I apologize for the pain, but holy shit - It looked great!
Zach's are the most practical he should wear them more often, heels really aren't that bad unless you get motherfucking daggers like Eugene
"Why am I painting all of my toes when you can only see about ... 7?" Yasssss
I could last the night in Zach's heels tho lmao they look hella comfortable
They lasted longer than I usually do! 😄
the key is to get very very drunk so you don't feel the pain 😂😂😂
I won't wear heels more than an hour
3:56 the new season of Yuri on ice
why you change locations so much!? when I go out I stay in one place the whole night unless is really boring
YES EUGINE, WORK IT!!
Eugene in heels 10/10
I still think Zach looked the cutest in the shoes!
4:14 awww isn't Eugene's shirt so adorable?
Eugene would get the biggest highest heels.
TUNAILS
now those r heels ugene
i hope they broke those in
Eugene dancing....👌👌👌👌👌👌life
zacks out fit works with those heels and he looks supper cute
jesus eugene
I'm a ballet dancer and I constantly walk on my toes, so wearing heels later in life will be easy lol
I would prob wear Zachs but I don't even wear heels
"I can't compete with that" 😂😂😂
Now try this with the boob weights and being on your period like in that one non try guys video where men try to period for 3 days.
of course Eugene goes hard lol love it
is it just me, or do those heels Zach picked out actually look good with his outfit.
I guess I'm weird cause I wear four inch heels almost every day and I love it.....
Eugene is such a queen 😍
the fact that they walk in heels better than me is sad
Hey can anyone explain why people go from bar to bar I just turned 18 in October btw so new to all of that lol
why does ned have a better butt than me
zac's weren't even heels
Eugene and zach dropping in heels is everything
Did you know in the 70s men wear high heels and then in the 80s they stopped an then in the 90s woman wear high heels
so happy I'm a male f being a female shits way to hard
Hopefully this will knock some sense into those bitches who torture themselves with heels.... Men will love you just the same without them so get over yourselves ...
For me high heel are easy to were and i'm 10 so...
I would have done a wedge with a peek toe
I use ankle boot heels like that everyday like
Omg Keith's fiancé is gorgeous. But so is Ned's wife.
i would honestly wear zach's whole outfit
Eugene is a hot dancer
dammn i would wear zach's whole outfit lmao
omg ariel and eugene's reactions when ned fell
I LOVE EUGENE
zach's heels were so cute i want them. also don't think ive ever been more in love with eugene?
Thats my kink
What is the name of the outfit that girl at 4:03 is wearing? The one holding the pink phone! I need to know!
Damn, Zach looks good in those boots. He should wear those regularly
Zach's shoes look good on him
so gay..
Eugene was feeling his oats
Eugene has better balance in 6inch heels then I do in flats😂
I'm think Zach will last the longest
Okay no kidding Zach's hills weren't even bad at all, I would wear that every single day without any problem
Keith has a fiancée?!
I've got to admit Eugene, you're right. You look really good in heels! All of you do.
Can I just say that the alcohol takes the pain away.
Zack better keep those boots, cause he was rocking them! He looked so good in them!
Zach is at his sexiest omg
zac is so adorable his heels
Zach looked hot, i dug the heels
Hello Ned's butt!
i lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but i make these high heels work
I love how they throw the heels in the bin 😂😂
Let's just pray that Eugene is never going to leave buzzfeed?
I need Eugene's shirt omg
Ok ...Man in Heels are weirdly hot.... And slay
My lord, the try guys are just killing me!! Haha
Oh hell yeah, im all about those dagger pumps
they should have shown the next day and how painful and bad it is the next day (especially for Eugene) when it feels like it would be the best to cut your feet off
This is why I wear platforms and thick heels
Try wearing heels after you've had back surgery, that's why I never wear them , I did once and never again will I wear heels
someone's gotta send zach those lift insoles if he really feels that much more confident with the extra inch or two
I would 100% wear Zach's shoes
Is it the same with insoles? If so, then I feel sorry for Jimin 😂
(jk)
I love shoes...but I would you give up eating chocolate, or wear Crocs for the rest of your life?
Eugene isn't gay cuz he's a boss with the women BUT his metrosexuality is teetering on the line of homosexuality lol. Ain't nothing wrong with that
When I'm challanged to dance...I motherf*king dance😂💙 it literally made my day
Obviously eugene had to wear the highest shoes he's so extra I love him.
Ned has a nice butt. Now the try guys know how much pain woman go through to wear heals. Although, I feel really bad for them because they might not be able to walk for a couple hours after this.
I ve always wanted the Try Guys to do this I m so happy thank you Keith , Ned , Zach and Eugene
I questioned Eugene's sexuality when he danced in those heels😂😂
y is eugene so hot?!?!😫
haven't watched the whole video yet,, so maybe this happens, but, I wanna see the next morning charlie horse reaction
They already beat me
 They made it out the door with heels 😂😂😂
late squad where you at
Ariel and Ned are the cutest couple ever!
Zac looks fine af in those boots
"not wasted, just wearing heels". lol. story of my life.
hahaha
6:14 its official. Eugene is my spirit animal
Ariel is so pretty omg
I can't even wear heels
Zach's rant about being short and girls wearing heels is literally what I live for😂
"If you slap on 4 extra inches, I can't compete with that!"
I love Neds wife
Of course Eugene has to do The Most™
DAMN! Eugene can work it 👌🏼💃🏻🙌🏼
does anyone else ship eugene & zach 💀💀
I like heels, except the part about destroying your feet
Buzzfeed doesn't block swear words anymore? (Haven't watched this channel in a while)
"I may have made a terrible mistake..but I look hot" YAS SAME
is it just me or does zac look good
WARNING WARNING : GAY VIDEO ._.
I think guys look hot in heels but it makes sense because they were originally made for men.
I think Eugene in high heels is my new kink
are eugene and zach dating?
Keith has a fiance now?! 😮
Is no one going to mention the strippers in the last bar? Must have been a really crazy night
YAY EUGENE
lol im 13 and im wearing Daggers with comfortability, i hate heels but i feel fabulous and tbh i thought it would be hell, i wasnt so MAN UP
zach didn't complain at all, he was so good!
this entire video is literally just the timeline of me in pointe class
This video made my life!My god was Ned funny
Um Zach pulls those off really well???
I love how they all went for safe options, low heals and then there's Eugene😂😂
damn zach, where u get them boots. need me some of those
now try the shoes with the boobs.
Zach had the best heels but Eugene look the sexiest.
Eugene and Ned with those booties <3
"Bar to Bar at the speed of sound"

"But I make these high heels work"
I swear if Eugene leaves I'm officially done with buzzfeed 😐end of mother effin story
i actually wants zachs heels lmao
"What advice do you have for us?"
"Don't."
Fucking love Ariel!
High heels were acc made for men
Please do the 
Try Guys Try Find Something Eugene Can't Do
How did they all look so good in heels! Impressed!
Eugene your beyonce index is over 3000 ♡ lov ya
wait is that shane dawson's producer?????
Maybe all mangers that want make high heels the dress clothes for work should do this
I just keep rewatching the Try Guys  videos cause they just keep me super entertained. I hope you guys try LARPing  (live action role play) I'd love to see that. XD
6:23 - 6:30 what is happening (the answer is fusion ) lmao woo you go amethyst aka Eugene
You should've done it for a week with different ones every day
I walk like ned in heels 😂😂
Why isnt this noted as a try guys video?
Zach had it easy they had a large base which are WAYYY easier to walk in that the daggers
I wanna go out drinking with Eugene ngl
"I go by a dumpster and take of maa heels" yep that's usually how the night ends.
Can anyone help me? http://www.gofundme.com/movingclosertofamily
Whoever came up with this, must be really, really bored. I bet they were thinking "Yo, we're running out of ideas... Hey I know! Let's get a bunch of guys to wear heels and make a full 10 minute video about it" I love buzzfeed❤️
Zach looked so good tho wtf
All that Try Guys does is prove that Eugene can do everything better than everybody
Nice to see them realising the struggle. My job when I was 17-18 made us all wear minimum 4 inch heels for our 8+ hour shifts and it was BRUTAL.
wow i would actually wear zach's outfit...
6:24  0_0
Every try guy video ever: Ned: But doesnt it make my butt look good?
thats the crazyest i have ever seen eugene
Zach won, but in all fairness he did pick the most practical pair of heels.
I wore 5 inch plus heels every day for over 10 years and now my feet are deformed, I can literally walk on my toes. Do this as a challenge, or wear heels for at least a week and then we're talking. 😀
Can the Try Guys do acrylic nails?
I'm Eugene... I don't wear heels to play I wear them to slay. Get out of here with kitten heels
honestly, what ELSE would eugene wear?
ive never wanted to wear heels, but zach's looked fuckiN awesome i kinda want them
Imagine wearing heels, being on your period and being drunk (ughhhhh)
When ever I wear heels I look like a hunchback but when they do it they look awesome
zach is literally the smol-est thing ive ever seen aww
I see how short the heels are and the shortest pair of heels I wear are 6 inch stiletto (The height of Eugene's pair)....I'll wear them all day and run in them with no problem lol. Maybe its because I'm a girl but idk... and Zach's are barely heels lol.
Little jealous of the girl dancing in Eugene's lap.. .
The try guys is the main reason I've stayed subscribed to buzzfeed for so long😍😂
They now knw the struggle is fucken real and eugen he did look hot
i didn't know how much i needed this until i realized i needed this!
2:25 so long god damn
owwww
Zack's heels looked so cute
But i make these high heels work
can i be the "EUGENE IS SO HOT LOOK AT HIS BUTT AT 2:31" comment for this video????
Poor Ned... He's adorable.
Ned's legs and tush looked A-friggen-mazing in those heels though, damn!
zack was the easy ones I wear boot heels everyday
Welcome to the females night
If only they could simulate pronation in the feet. That would show them true pain.
Who was the girl dancing with Eugene?
Eugene is so beautiful
i love Eugene so much
but let's take a look on Eugene's
 t-shirt, so cute ^__^
i lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt, but i make these high heels work
I HAVE THE SAME ANKLE BOOTS AS ZACK!!! They are so comfortable.
Eugene is doing stuff to me mentally i just wanna watch him dance all day
Zach: What is happening 
I was dying!!!! 😂😂😂
This, ladylike and unsolved is literally the only thing I watch on buzzfeed🙃🙃
zach looks good with ankle boots on honestly
The Try Guys and Worth It are my favorite
zachs are the best
heels: 2017's torcher device
I actually think that Eugene looks nice.
where can I get the shirt Eugene had on with all their names on it?
why dont they wear platform heels they're much easier. even i dont wear heals
'keith would you be a dear'
so cute
Perks of being a tall girl:
Wearing heals is a fashion mistake 

The only fashion rule I obey tbh
Eugene has worn heels before. remeber try guys try try fake preg at bellies?  and try guys try drag? and people learn iconic dances? yeah, Eugene is an experienced person in the art of wearing high  heels
My life goal is dancing with Eugene.
i made a terrible mistake but I look hot
If you dont wear them long enough that it hurts more to be flat footed for thirty minutes then you dont know real pain m8
Ah, this video made me want heels.
it's even worse when you stay the night at a friend's after a night in heels and you forget any flats and have to put the heels back on the next morning to go home...
Eugene is low key thicc
"Welcome to the real world" I'm dying gOd the assholes of the world
I wasn't going to click on this vid, but then I saw those three simple words: the try guys.and I clicked faster than you can say "Eugene is hot."
but I make these high heels work 👠
1:01 OH MY GOOOOD
(Don't read if you're easily irritated and an anti) 

This makes me remember about the time in which V danced and jumped in high heels with no problem
Kim Taehyung can slay in heels with no practice..
But I make these high heels work! 
Am I the only one who could only think of P!ATD while watching this, and that Brendon should have joined in this?
I would choose Zach´s heels. They look comfortable. But if I wear heels, I usually take flats with me also so I can change if I need to.
Eugene  is the only one of them that took the right heels the rest of them are just finding easy ones
"So when I was challenged to dance..
I motherfucking danced"

God I love that man
Eugene's heels are to big. There shouldn't be a gap that big between the back of his ankle and the shoe.
Dormtainment..
when eugene started dancing I died
how talk are you? I'm 5'7 😌
did no one notice that they went to a strip club and you could clearly see a girl on the poll?
bar to bar at the speed of sound... fancy feet dancing through this crowd... Oh yah!
Eugene is literally me, lmao. 6 inches are my go-to, and it's always painful AF but the reasoning "I look hot" keeps you going xD
they all looked great in heels tho. (I think Eugene's might have been a little too big) but Ned's calves and his butt??? Even better with heels
They should've given the advice that you should always buy heels the right size and preferably one size smaller than usual.... Because Eugenes heels were way too big lol it still looked good though
I had a dream that Ned got a butt reduction. I don't know why but I was sad and concerned..until he asked about his butt and then I realized everything was okey. 😂😂😅😅
Disappointed that Eugene didn't sing 6 Inch by Beyonce.
Zach's shoes is the most comfortable tbh
I like Ned's outfit lol
Zach has high heels that I might actually wear, his are the safest
next: the try guys try periods
Ngl those heels looked really good on Zach
I know the pain lol I'm a woman lmao.. I'm happy they experience wearing high heels.. high heels are sexy but deadly 💀👍🏼😂😊🙌🏻
Ok, you guys all look hot! xD
zach is me in heels lol
why am I not surprised that Eugene was the hottest when dancing??
Is Keith marrying a woman or a man?
Eugene always gotta be so extra hahahahhaha
Zach's shoes were probably the easiest. If I ever want to go out looking good without the pain of heels, those are the type of boots I would pull out.
Ankle boots are like an everyday wear for me. They would definitely be the last ones to flat out.
Eugene had the hardest heels though hands down
I love how Eugene always goes all out , he had on the craziest heels , i wanna be friends with him
goddamn eugene had some impressive heels
im dying
Eugene love yours
Con los años dejas de sentir dolor extremo
I actually think guys should wear heels, like as a social norm because, the guys all looked really good in them.
How does Eugene look good in literally anything
Did I hear Stacy Q in the background ?
Zach looks so cute but Eugene could literally step on me i would thank him
Where did zach get those shoes 😍
Ned and Ariel are so cuteeee 😭😭😭❤❤❤
Honestly Eugene is me
They are so hot, love those heels
omg... the whole time watching this i was so scared someone was going to roll their ankle
Can you please do this: Try guys were long hair for a day, I'm talking about down to their butts length
I would wear those little boots, damn they're cute.
The best thing about feels is the amazing feeling of taking them off after a long day.Also i want Zack's boots
Keith and Ned are shirt twinsies.
EUGENE'S DANCING. OH. MY. GOD.
I wear 3 inch boots almost every other day lmao
BuzzFeed should make a "Women wear a beard for a day" video. Who's with me?
So i was challenged to dance 

I muther fucken danced 
        😂😂😂😂😂 -----Eugene 2k17
Eugene. Aims To Slay.
Eugene is a badass
Eugene is a beautiful man
I'm sorry but isn't Zach cheating?
Zach's boots fit him so well I'd love him to wear more!!!
a good way to describe this video "I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK" Que that thing Brendon does when he say he makes the high heels work
I would have given up if I was bleeding or falling!
like so they will post thier 4000th vid
They look like failing drag queens
Hate heels, love boots! I prefer platform, but if a wicked leather knee-high has a couple inches, I'm down!
i dont even have words
This was honestly the best try guy video! Absolutely love it 💐 you go guys 😘
the Try Guys need to try either stripper heels or stripping! try not only walking in those, but also dancing in those for 12 hours a night! my feet are in pain 24/7
Look at all those booties~
Low Eugene 6:09 was just too much
Yeah, imagine having a job that requires walking for over 8h, and having to work in heels... that sucks, even in the most comfortable heels...
Ned has some fuckin L E G S and booty in this vid ! Yaaas !
Is it bad that I would wear all those heels? For like a whole day..... I know .... I'm bad
Only the beginning and I already love it.  Becky, Katie and Ariel at the start was a nice touch.  Well, Zach's are cute! And look totally doable.  Aw, Keith's nails look great!  Wish I had such nice, broad nails to paint.  Or, rather, be painted for me.  Ned, what were you thinking with a narrow, three-inch heal on a silver shoe?  Not cute, especially with that outfit.  And as for Eugene, I'm shaking just my head but every fiber of my being says no.  Uhoh incline.  Wow Katie looks great!   Love that outfit!  That black, flowy jumpsuit.  So cute.  And those heels work. 

Whoa okay four plus hours that's impressive.  Lots of sitting which I totally understand but that was a good long run in heels.  Ned and Keith good for you for saving your feet.  Zach's feet are going to be fine.  His Achilles might be a bit sore the next day but he's so stable.  Eugene though.  Yah, stabbing yourself in the brain with a heel I get that.  Wait did he just hit on that blonde so he could lean on the gate?  Or on her?  Oh he's going to be in such pain.  Owch.
Eugene with high heels looks really really hot. 

It's weird.
no one gonna acknowledge eugene's dancing?
sees a Try Guy in the thumbnail and clicks on video cos I'm easily sold
That moment you realize that Eugene was like 6'6" in this video
Except Eugene's I have tried all of them
I like how Eugene challenged himself because he already knew how to walk in heels
To be fair, if those shoes were right out of the box then that means they probably weren't properly broken into yet which makes everything even more painful.
He shoe too big for he got dam feet!
Love this and love them
Zack looks good tho
It's all fun and games until you step on some stones and have to dive into a dumpster to retrieve your shoes 😂
I'm not sure if those heels are enough for Gaga 😂😂
I wear heels that have a cover and aren't that high
Eugene looks good in everything!!! Howwww??? LOL.
why are they bending their knees so much? I wear heels, but this never happened, why???
Some women have to wear those to work because they are considered professional.
Of COURSE Eugene would pick the sexiest heel....when is he ever not sexy?? Lol
I heard Ned went to Yale... and here he is, wearing heels and doing some other ridiculous stuff.
They lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt...
But they make them high heels work! :')
I think I got gayer for Eugene

I'm 18 in two years, call me then, Euguene ;)
Of course Eugene chooses the most dramatic heels
Omg Eugene at the and with his feet, ouch 😖
i am never ever going to wear heels.
I don't know why they are doing this. They wore heels when they did drag.
Buzz feed like omg it's so hard for women to wear heels U DONT NEED TO
Coitado do Eugene :( :(
99% of the comments say how Eugene looks hot in anything
Ugean: so when I was Challenge to dance I motherfucking danced 

Me : dying of laughing too much😂😂😂
This test is kinda relative tho cos the heavier the person the more painful it is as there's more weight on the heels. Like Keith is a tall man so surely it's gonna hurt more than on someone like Zach
That's why you only buy heels that are comfortable.....
😭 I WANT CUTE ANKLE BOOTS and my best friends always holds my hands when I wear heels
Eugene's a baller lmao
Erm zach. have you tried creepers ?
Ned's hair looks good ngl
sus af just close down your company
I love their wives/girlfriends/friends, the ladies were awesome
Neds moves and but though!
6:08 just like OMG!!
Eugene looks hot in anything!
Toddlers on ice skates lmao
Eugene looks like he's magically balancing on his tippy toes lmao
Did they make those high heels work? Wheres the man in a chiffon skirt?
Of course Eugene had the hottest shoes. Of course Eugene looked hot as hell in them.
Eugene is literally my spirit animal😂😂😭😭😭😭💕👍
XD LOL
lol i am a girl and i hte helles
Not gonna lie, Zach is my spirit animal...
Eugene totally fucked that chick who grinded him! Haha
Knew it was WEHO!
7:14 that place reminds me of smosh
Okay, when is Eugene not hot?
Zach's heels looked great and I suddenly want to wear them?????? hmm..
2:36 YAASSSSSSS!!!!
This video made my heels hurt lol
Eugene the blessing
They wear heels better than I do in a million years.
They shouldve had the girls go with them and wear heels and see how they handle it
guys that's why you take a pair of pumps with you as well
The only thing Ned cares about is if his butt looks good. every video 'does it make my butt look good'
The guy who stepped on Ned pissed me off, if it was Eugene On the other hand I would be plotting murder if somebody hurt bae
i think only eugenes were bad
zac has the easiest one
Y A S E U G E N E
Zachs shoes are the only one of them I would wear for a night out. What's the purpose of shoes you can't dance in?
The give it a whirl fuckers
I'm a girl and I would never wear any of these, except for zach's boots
I would wear zach's heels
Of course eugenes heels are 6 inches
Eugene walked into the club like nobodys buisness ✋💜
Hahahaha A+ music choice @ Mozart's Requiem coming on when Eugene unwrapped those dagger pumps... "Confutaaaatis, malediiiiictis, flaaamis acribus addiiictis"... Ominous much? XD
Funny, but I thumbed it down because this was a hard watch. Thx.
i can't even find heels in my size, i'm mad
it's March now.   there is still a price. uhhh.   am I missing something
1:44 - 1:51 possibly the most adorable thing I've seen in my life time.
Zack rocked those heels xD
You buy your hills half a size smaller than you actually are. That's why eugene didn't fit.
Jebus Christ look at all the music used in the description
Keith looks even more of a giant with his heels
we can call Eugene the king that can slay a queen bee
Someone tell my why Eugene pulls it off more than I
Eugene is my spirit animal.
I want Eugene's heels
At my school there's a girl that wears high heels every day there like 6 inches or even more and she even runs in them in gym
0:12 is how I walk every time I wear heels.
Love Eugene's but here really just for the bedroom lol.
Eugine is extra af
These guys literally make Buzzfeed interesting 😂😂😂
Once again, Eugene is perfect
Ned is such a dad
I love Eugene's dancing
He lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt but Eugene makes those high heels work
You know, it really make you wonder does the money they get worth it?
i really wanted to see one of them in wedges
eugene is the most hilarious guy ever
"when i was challenged to dance, i mother***** danced!" yessssss
I wore heels to school....i got on the bus and immediately regretted it. I put on my flip flops at 12:30. I was close only had 1 more class.
so true about drinking just masking the heel pain
Does anyone know the brand of the black ankle boots he's wearing ?
"The try guys" videos are the only videos that make sense and have meaning on BuzzFeed
Anyone know where Zach's booties are from? 😮
Zach should wear the boots if he feels more confident in them. They look great
I feel so bad for dudes who end up feeling short when I wear heels, lmao, there should be shoes that have like, raised insides but they look normal on the outside, just so that short dudes can feel taller 😂that's why I like heels 'cause I'm like five feet tall, but I'm a girl so that doesn't count as much 😂😂
I call them ankle breakers
Eugene is so extra 😂
"But i look hot" 
When don't you Eugene
There is such thing as comfortable heels. Heeled boots are the most comfortable. If they have a wider, block shaped heel then they'll be easier to walk in and won't hurt nearly as much. Also, keeping it realistic for your foot is always more comfortable. I've got two pairs of black heeled boots like that and they are very comfortable for me to walk in and I can wear them all day. They're great. I can run in them too. Though personally I prefer flat shoes/boots.
Work it queens! 😝✌️😂❤️
Awww come on guys i wear 7in stilettos with 2in platforms most nights as a drag queen!!!!!
Is it weird that I want Zack's shoes? I have the grey version of them with a silver zipper and shorter. Lol.
Why do guys stick their knees way out when they walk in high heels? Lol 😂😂
Where are Zacks heals from!?!?
"When I got challenged to dance... I motherfucking danced."
dUDE LOOK AT kIM tAEHYUNG
My husband Eugene was again proves he's amazing
How Eugene walks in 6 inch heels is still better than I can do in 3 inch heels.
They should've worn the same type of heels so that it would be fair because Zachs heels are way more comfortable than eugenes heels and that's why zach lasted longer
Eugene is actually me tbh
If anybody could wear six inch heels, Eugene can.
"Keithhh, would you be a dear" Forget his wife, i ship it.
Zach basically wasn't even wearing heels
P.s. Eugene looks HOT
But I make these highheels work
Zach and his outfit won all of this night!
"When I stood in those six-inch stilettos I look f*cking hot as sh*t" 😂😂
I want to be a "Try guy" HAHAHAHAHA So much fun.
What about the try guys try to stop trying forever?
So basically.. Try guys is now '' Experience your privilege, you fuckin' white male '' .. Can you go camp or get drunk again please you pitiful, emasculated betas'?
tbh zach looks so good
Zach's heels were so cute! I'd be totally down to wear those, thick boot heels are the best and are so comfortable (Compared to other heels)
Ned looks hot!
I have the same shirt as zach 😂
Why do [high heel wearers] do this to themselves??!?!?!
Of course Eugene got the highest ones 😂
I love dagger heels... if the heels aren't 5-6 inches or taller then I won't wear them, but I love ankle booties heels those are the exception 😂😂
Zac looks so cute
Imagine being the girl that Eugene danced on
If anyone knows where the black booties are from that zach wore then someone please tell me lol
I wear Zach's heels everyday.....
when you have to google how much 3 inches is in centimetres 😂
The try guys to Marine Corps 54 Hour Crucible
EUGENE DANCING IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN
They walk how I walk when I have period cramps
Man spreading
"nope not wasted, just wearing heels" OMG SO RELATABLE 😂 I tripped over a carpet and slammed into my friend clubbing once and they kicked me out. I HAD ONE SHOT 😂
Of course Eugene goes full out with 6 inch heels😂
Zach has comfortable 3 inches boots and Eugene has the worst type of high heels? Not fair
In my country ,there are some weddings and sweet sixteen's parties that give flip flops near its  end.
zach's heels were the best and smartest, of COURSE he didn't have any trouble! I think i have those heels, too! they're so cute!
I think they all looked awesome in heels! guys should definitely wear more heels!!! Zach totally looked cutest this vid <3
Can we honestly say that any of them lost though?!
Can we just appreciate the fact that Eugene was wearing six inch stilettos that were TOO BIG for his feet?? Major props
finally a video
is eugene gay
Eugene, why must you look so good in everything??
lmfaooo i started laughing the 5 seconds in to the video
Omg Eugene! XD
Zach looked really good im gonna be honest
Ned's butt looked 👍 great
6:26 omg i wanna be that girl
Keith is me towards high heels
I would Definitely wear Zack's shoes! 😍😍😍
MOTHERF'N EUGENEEEEEEEE
What is the name of the asian eyes child
Eugene is so wild!! Grrr 🐯
we need a ladylike/try guys collab
hmmmmm......i've gone shopping at walmart and several other places for a project in ankle boots that have heels literally the size of my face with my friend.....she had to pull them off of me.
was that laganja and shangela???
also does that mean eugene and keith are now both 6'6
Damn those boaties
Eugene looks hawt.
Eugene is something special and i love him and we all love him
THEY LOOK LIKE SATYRS
DAMN EUGENE
honestly tho, Zac looks super hot in those ankle boots. he should rock those more often 👌
I NEED ZACH'S SHOES OMF!
I don't wear heels. EVER. But in the right circumstances I would give the ones Zach is wearing a shot! They're cute. And they seem like they would kill you just a little slower than the rest of them 😃
I feel soft whenever I imagine them wearing chokers IDK WHY I JUST FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO SEE EUGENE AND ZACH  WEARING THEM REGULARLY
I walk in 5 in heels no platform for 6 hours straight without pain. I must be a rare woman cuz y'all can't go 3 hours in a four inch
i cant say if eugene's a sadist or a masochist but those heels... god i would rather go barefoot
I think I would wear Zach's shoes, to be honest
Zach has t easy!!!
They... actually kindy looked hot in those shoes...
zach actually looks kind of cute in ankle boots.
As a short person, I always wear heels when I go out so I definitely feel Zach on that front. I've learned that putting bandaids on the main places that get hurt the most BEFORE you go out can help you last longer too! :3
Clicked for Eugene, stayed for... well Eugene
Eugene.... a personal hit to every single person self esteem including super models. He's literally perfection in human form. Dammit. And I'm not attracted to him, I just appreciate how bloody stunning he is. 
Oh the jealously burns.
I usually wear six inch heels the whole night, but the good thing is the feeling you get when taking them off
freaking Eugene
Did anyone else want to be that girl that Eugene um danced with? Lol
Is eugene bi?
This relates so much to Don't threaten me with a good time 😅
Lol I wear Zach's heels for comfort around the house.
yes eugene looks good HAHAHAH
They all looksoooo hoooot
4:13 I WANT THAT SHIRT
Eugene was wearing a try guys shirt! I want one!
TCU
there is no way i could walk in any of those heels, cause my skills are terrible
me laughing at men wearing heels better than I would ever do
just what i needed
I'd never thought heels can make one's feet bleed that much... They really are dagger pumps.
wow Eugene you look good in everything....
Eugene really toughed it out. He had the highest heels and he was very active and lasted till the end. Wow!
and women keep crying for equality when we bring this torture upon ourselves
Eugene went in when he was  dancing lmaoo
I need zach's heels in my life D:
I have Zac's shoes…...
Great Big Story is way better than your crap buzzfeed.
One day I went to a party and I wore a high heel of 6 cm the hole night. Observation: I'm 15 years old kkkk
I have the exact same ankle boots XD
All the Try Guys' hotness increased by 40% with heels, like dayummmm
I think that the buzz Feed guys are totally in the closet. and there spouse's cheat on their candy asses. I have seen way to many videos where they are doing woman like things to them selves. I honestly don't know how there women stay with them !
"make my mom and sisters proud" lmao
What are the "TryGuys"?
I need those black heels Zach had on in my life tho tbh
Who's Eugene?
I wanna wear stilettos because they're basically weapons for your feet. Ooooh, and then a little blade on the tip!

Everything I wear can murder you.
That moment when you realize a guy looks better in those high heels 👠 than you
that boi Eugene
Zacks little song 💖
Daaaaaamn Zach 👌👌👌
"welcome to the real world"?!! Seriously?! Wow Your real world is this?
How tall is zach?
Why a night, why not a day? Or a week?
Eugene looks hot no matter what he's wearing !
Oh Lord, they didn't break in the heel, brave men
I was expecting ugene to stab someone with his dagger heals
They smacked it 
I can't even wear heels properly and I'm a women 👏🏽😂😂
It gets easier overtime.
man down. MAN DOWN.
I LOST IT
like this hasnt been done before. how original!!
This video was so good. Everyone slayed. Made me smile and giggle, y'all looked godly despite the pain! 😘
LOOK AT EUGENE DANCING, LIKE DAMN.
How does Eugene dance like that in heels and normal
When Keith said "T-nails" I died 😂😂😂😂
Zach and Eugene killed it
Eugene's heels are impractical there should be a limit of high a heel can go
Shoutout to my mans Keith with the fiancé
I personally don't think heels look THAT good on males but I think Zachs boots with the heel are really wearable. He looks great in those!
did that guy really say "welcome to the real world" tho
I feel like Zach cheated. If this was supposed to be a competition, Eugene definitely won
I haven't seen this yet, but can only guess Eugene wins at this
Zach´s shoes are a lot of girls everyday shoes :D
lol
He doesn't like christmas?!
Oh you Eugene you have seriously underestimated how painful heels that high are...
I have worn 6 in heel before I can handle  it 😂👌
Zach had the right to go with a boot. In fact since heels were made for men just wearing heal boots would be fine for the guys to wear. They did look good though.
I myself am a larger person and I can't wear heels at at all. Once I loose weight you never know.
I really liked those ankle boot heels. They weren't to high either, three inches with a thick base? All good haha
This is bob 🦃    Bob can't swim.        SO DONT LET THIS COMMENT GET LOST IN THE COMMENT SEA🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃🦃
"My toes are bleeding... but I look hot"
IVE.MISSED.THE.TRY.GUYS
ANYONE ELSE GET A PIERCE THE VEIL AD??
They should all wear shirts with Eugene's face on it saying "I'm hot you're not"
NEED FRIENDS LIKE THISSSS PLZZZ GOD PLZZZ 😂😭LOVE U TRY GUY❤❤❤❤
Try Louboutins! 🤕
Eugene is literally hot💖💖💖
ok serious question were do you get those shoes from because I am size 10 UK and finding hills that size is super hard
Ok but who else lost it at 'that tush is got the push?!'
who wore it better women or guys?
THEY LOOK SO GOOD!!! 😍😍😍
Eugene is always hot.
Omfg Eugene I cant even lmao
Zach's are probably really comfortable. Like that's an everyday type of shoe, at least for me lol.
Who loves Eugene even more?....✋🏻✋🏻✋🏻
I watch Buzzfeed Video for the Try Guys and Worth It. I watch Buzzfeed Blue for Buzzfeed Unsolved. That's the extent of my Buzzfeed experience
But I make these high heels work...
Zach looks so awesome in his I want his heels
HAHAHAHAHA THIS IS GOLD!
try guys are the best!😂👌🏼❤
I want to marry Zach he's so adorable
Zach's shoes are cute and i would prefer to wear those than the other ones
Ned looked hot tbh
Zach looked so good in those heels
I feel like every employer that requires women to wear heels at work needs to watch this video and try to wear heels themselves before they tell their employees they have to wear them. They really hurt!
Eugene's shirt at 8:34 😁
But we already knew Eugene was gonna slay
OMG Zach same. I'm already shorter than my friends and they all wanna wear heels during concerts making me like a midget cuz I choose flats over heels. 
Comfort over fashion!!!!
Zach has such a good fashion sense! He looks great!
I want eugenes shirt (the one with all their names)❤️
Taking off heels is like having a huge orgasm
The ankle boots are actually comfortable and easy to walk in that doesn't count
Zach could just wear those seriously and look good!
That was not just a car. It was a Rolls..
Dammmnnnn those ankle boots. Would totally wear these. Not painful at all (compared to stilettos or pumps)
I was so happy to hear Ned say "but does it make my butt look good?" XD
Speaking of which - I wore heels for 11 hours straight on a night out a few days ago. I had brought flats, but didn't give in. When I came home, I felt like I had reached the epitome of my potential in this world, and I am still living high on that pride
"I WAS HUNGRY" 

😂😂😂😂😂
Still walking better than me ( a 20 y.o female).
8:00 That moment zach almost gets ran over by a rolls-royce...
those heels LEGITIMATELY look good on Zach I'm impressed with the outfit cooridnation
those ankle boots are so cute. and the most sensible shoes out of the bunch
at least now they can respect women a bit more
i wanted to see Eugene's relaxing moment after 6 inches why did you have to cut it
zac is unbearable to watch. he's not funny and disgusting
Zach's boots are cute as hell. best shoe choice. I want a pair
Zach`s shoes were basically an everyday shoe for most women I know. They look really nice and comfortable actually :D
I'm a drag queen who LOVES heels, and I was just like " Oh that's cute " When I walk every weekend in my 9 inch heels for 8+ hours!
The best bit of my night is walking to the taxi, shoes in hand feeling the relief, not aware of the Mount Everest blisters that will appear in the morning
Ned's butt looks 10/10
EUGENE WAS AMAZING IN THIS VIDEO OH MY GODDDDD
Eugene is the girl I wouldn't talk to in a club.
Omg i love Zachs shoes😍
LOL "U CAN WATCH THE WHOLE THING AND PAY NOTHING" OMG
said it b4 I'll say it again you guys are HILARIOUSLY IDIOTIC!
"What advice do you have for us?"
"Don't."
Zach looks cute in boots :3
EUGENE YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE SKJDNDBD
Lmao at them walking down the steps 😂😂😂😂
don't let your kids watch this.
👠👠👠👠👠
I feel bad for everyone but Zack. As someone who lives in 2-3 inch ankle boots, I refuse to hear any complaints.
WHO WAS THA GIRL EUGENE WAS DANCING WITH (⊙.⊙(☉̃ₒ☉)⊙.⊙)
Zach and Eugene look lit af
Eugene is amazing.
What an as$hole who said Welcome to the real world. Just say sorry
I'm simple person. I see Eugene, I click.
oh heLL YES
"Who's that man walkin down the street with delicate feet? It's Zach." He's honestly adorable
"t'nails"
If this gets to 15 likes I'll buy you a nandos.
I can't even wear a freaking 1/2 wedge or whatever it's called without falling on my face
9:46 You see, a normal video would get flagged or something, I wonder if that would happen here...
I love Eugene's and Zach's heels but hate Ned's and Keith's. Only Eugene's are tall enough.
Is wearing heels the only way to prevent Eugene from walking away when they drink? Let's find out! 😂
I told the girls in my group that went to prom that they were being babies about the heels. They told me to try it that night. I did. I danced for 3 hours and I honestly can say my feet felt fine. I understand they hurt but I fell like some girls are a little overdramatic on how bad they are
One word to describe this:

'F A B U L O U S"
Zach's outfit was gorgeous, 10/10 would wear.
I sometimes wear 8+ inch platform heels for drag and honey walking home isn't fun in those a six inch is a bless
I already forgot...was it Eugene and Zach that were the perfect friends (from the BFF genetics vid)?
😀
04:21 TWP OF HEARTS TWO HEARTS THAT...
When Eugene dropped it low 😘😍🍑
Zach made the best choice for heels that wouldn't murder his feet
Zac's heels went really well with him tbh
Zach looks friggen great in heels
zach had the best choice
Fun fact: 
Men actually wore heals before women did back in history
Zach had a daytime bootie. Like come on man that's not a heel.
I have never wore heels out but I did got out once with brand new shoes... and I walked a lot so by the end of the day my feet were just bleeding but I didn't want to take them off because they were too cute 😂 the struggle is real
is anyone else really surprised they didn't make this a feminist thing about how society makes women were heels. props to them for just having a fun nonpolitical video for once.
When I can't dance half as good as eugene
Dramatic af
yas i love how they are breaking "gender rules"
Petition to normalise men wearing heels cuz they look HOT
or course Eugene picked the dagger heels.  of course
I want Eugene's heels so bad, but I also know I would wear them once and complain the whole time.
They're so gorgeous though.
Ariel kinda looks like Iskra Lawrence 😛
I'm only 15 and I'm killer in heals.... I'd last more than normal women 😂🤔
Eugene is the reason I still watch Buzzfeed
jealous of the girl Eugene danced with
I love Zach's shoes!
omg
Zachs heels were actually sensible and looked cute with his outfit
7:09 "He just stepped on my toe!" :) Aw
The dancing between that girl and Eugene is goals, that was so hot in so many ways.
Heals r soo comfortable 😂😂
eugene went all in and I'm happy for that
Eugene is so freaking extra
hey that's not fair. Zach got the easiest one
I've never seen anyone get down in heels like eugene did
If I'm going to wear heels out I'll wear a boot type, something with ankle support. I have 6in stiletto ankle boots and they don't hurt my feet, but other times I'll wear the dagger heels. Mostly I wear flats because I'm already so tall.
wise wise Zach
6:42 Aw, he kissed him!!
Am I the only one who thought that Zach looked really good in his heels?? Like he pulled it off super well
these euguene stans got to go
Zach must of listened to others about which heals to wear.

Also I feel like taking your heals off are better than taking your bra off.
gosh dang it Eugene 😂
Of course Eugene got the dagger pumps, the highest and most challenging of all their shoes!
i think zach wore his heels the wrong way
I love it when you guys try smthg that we girls do all the time and suffer through - so taken for granted! You guys understand now 😭
6:13 Yanis Marshall, is that you? :) ily
Eugene is a better girl than the girls at my school😂
High heels are bad for your feet.

Les talons sont mauvais pour vos pieds.
I feel like Eugene got into his drag persona when he wore the heels
0:03 honey, you'd look hot even wearing a Chewbacca costume.
I wish they had noted the fact that you should NEVER TAKE THE HEELS OFF AND PUT THEM BACK ON. It makes it feel SOOOOO much worse when you take them off for a little break. Sure that break is going to feel good, but the pain that happens when you put the shoes back ON???? My god
Does this mean ankle boots win with less pain?
lol what's next the try guys try gay sex.
Eugene I pity his feet so much. I can't even do 3inch let alone 6
ARIEL AND NED LINKING ARMS IS MY NEW RELIGION
zach should wear them heels regularly he look Fine 🔥
Eugene dancing with that girl thoooooooo
Haha now they know how us women feel.
Ned: "What advice do you have for us?"
Ariel: "Don't."
SHE KNOWS THE PAIN
They should wear high heels like this AND the boob weights for a day!!!!! That's when they know what we go through✌✌
I can run and jump in heels i feel offended
Zack's outfit with his heels was actually really cute and paired well with them. He looked good!!
Im a simple girl... i see Eugene... i click
Eugenes shoes are crazy, I would never wear those lol
I once went out wearing 9 inch heels and they started to hurt like crazy but I didn't want to take them off or walk funny so I just put up with it. The next morning when I woke up the middle part of my foot (the bit that arches in the heel)  had no feeling in it, and the feeling didn't come back for a month :(
5:28 Ned always reminds me of Rick Cosnett, or Eddie from "The Flash". I mean, look at their faces!
Zach is the only smart one, I couldn't walk in the other ones
they're all walking around looking like confused baby deer
😂
Hahah step ahead boys girls do it best ;)
Ankle boots are easy to wear, that's why I like them
EUGENE GOING ALL OUT ❤️
zach has the safest one, im a girl, not only i cant walk in heels... i cant walk in flats either.. i always trip over 'something'
Ah yes one of the struggles of being Pentecostal ✌️ we're basically all heel lovers and they kill out feet 💯❤🖤
One time I held out all night, 10pm to 5am and now every time I wake up in the morning, get out of bed and put my feet down on the floor, my nerves ache 😅😅 haven't been the same since haha
One time I held out all night, 10pm to 5am and now every time I wake up in the morning, get out of bed and put my feet down on the floor, my nerves ache 😅😅 haven't been the same since haha
2:32
you're welcome.
Possibly the best Try Guys ever.
I can image Eugene in a club dancing very clearly 😂😂
The worst mistake is taking off your heels in the middle of the night for a break. Your feet are swollen and its only that much harder to fit them back in the shoes without some fresh bouts of pain.
Holy crap Eugene at 2:30 unpause and watch this move omg
keith the tajin should be in the kitchen it s for cooking, it s not a decoration XD go make yummy food in it bro XD
YES MY TRY GUYS, I HAVE BEEN WAITING
"I may have made a terrible mistake...but I look hot." Haha!
Welcome to the real world
pls let's normalize this guys look so good in heels
if your heels are uncomfortable dont wear them??? i just wear comfortable heels
Katie's face at 00:17 is priceless
they didn't blur the faces of the guy(s) that walked past Ned 😂😂😂
I've never related more to a video than I do right now.
Eugene always rocks wearing girl outfits...he looks better than me and i'm a girl!

Mwah 💋
omg I would be feeling uncomfortable wearing heels all night
Of course Eugene has to wear something that looks hot and deadly. 😂
Zach's heels are very comfortable...
Did Eugene say "you're really hot" to that girl?? He's in the mood to flirt even in excruciating pain 😂
Eugene "I think I made a terrible mistake...but I look hot"  me😂
why is ned always worried about does his butt look good ??😂
You can see that they applied the advice from the video where they got professionally styled to their everyday life 😁 You all look great, but Zack is B A N G I N
Is it just me or were Eugene's heels a bit too big for him? Probably only added to the intense discomfort he would have felt anyway...
I never wear heels because I know they will ruin my night lmao
The calves must be burning
MAN DOWN. MAN DOWN. 

LMFAO!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Eugene does look sexy in those 'Daggers', but when doesn't he look hot?!?
Gah Daym  , the force of cringe is powerful in this one ..
They all look so good in heels!
Keith's toes are the same length as his gf's fingers...
I love the heels that Zack is wearing
Brendon's the only one that can make those high heels work
Zach looks the most unsteady and hes in the easyest ones i wear wedge boots and i love them! I race my friends to dairy queen when we walk downtown after school and i full out run and win!
I'm a woman and I hate heels. it's bad for you're body and ankle WOMAN please wear flat or just no shoes. this is my opinion so if you disagree it's also you're opinion I just want to say this because people don't understand
How tall is Zach?
i am taller than all them except for Eugene
As we all know, Eugene makes a better girl/woman than all of us
and that is why you buy foldable shoes to carry in your bag
Zach looks pretty good with those little booties haha
Must be weird seeing a bunch of grown men dancing in high heels
Poor Ned....
Wait guys I wear shoes that have like a 5 inch platform and a 7 inch heel and can last through like nine hours of dancing in them, my friends and I have tried. Am I just a superhuman? Probably.
im a girl and I can't even rock heels like Eugene 😂
I feel like most of the guys went safe but Eugene went all out
DAAAMMN EUGENE!! 👅
Zachs out fit. Matches perfectly
Mens used to wear heels and women use heels to look mascular.
u made this already with other guys.
Can we all agree that Eugene rocks everything he wears
ned is me on a restaurant tho
Please i´m from Venezuela and i need your help! If you share this on Facebook will be help enough and a little of your time
https://www.generosity.com/community-fundraising/please-help-us-in-our-hour-of-need-sos-venezuela/x/12553434
Eugene is always so extra I love it
3:34 i had to do a double take i thought his hand was deformed!
I like how Zach says (talking about himself and Eugene) "Only the hot ones are left" yet they are the only single ones in the group
Now I'm really curious as to how tall Zac is 🤔
Ned: What advice do you have for us? 
Ariel: Don't. 
Hands down best advice ever
eugene in six inch heels? HELL YEA
Eugene looks the hottest
"when you drink, it distracts you from the pain" -- motto of my life
Zach picked the easiest ones haha
But they have done this before ? I think....
everyone is talking about how hot is Eugene but can we just appreciate how bomb Zach's outfit with those boots look??
i mean dayum, I would wear that
Zach's look so comfy I want ten
Zach's booties are the most comfortable, I similar booties almost every day.
eugene could probably still look hot even when he wears actual rags tbh
I feel like Keith would make an AWESOME Venus Van Dam
the ankle boots weren't supposed to be that bad
Zack's the only one with nice, pretty, more practical footwear.
No matter how bad my feet hurt I try to wait it out until my calfs start cramping
"any advice?"
"Don't."
when Brendon and the try guys lose a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt. but they all make those  high heels work.
Zach looks adorable in heels
1:12 He's pulling a Jenna Marble with those very divided/stretched toes...definitely not like our Holosexual queen, Christine.
Why do all man go into this almost instinctive stance of bending at the knees? I'm crying. What so hard about walking, starting with straight legs, and then you bend slightly at the heel but you move at the hips, not the knees (meaning it's the hip that does most of the work). They look like chickens with wide legs, walking with their knees bent. I'm laughing so much xD
Eugene lasted longer in heels then my mom can last.
Zach was the only one who didn't flip out most the time.
Ned fell off his chair and face planted which was actually the best thing on the internet.
Keith..Keith just got taller and that's all I have to say.
Brads wife got fired on his birthday. 
#justiceforbradswife
booooyyyyy let me catch my son on high heels
I squat like Eugene when I get tired in heels 😂
Okay they really look gorgeous wearing them heels . what a funny video I love it.
When I grow up I want to be Eugene, not LIKE him, I want to be him
i have zachs heels ....they're comfortable asf.
Actually a lot of kpop idols wear shoes kind of like zachs or wear insoles he should try it more
"When I was challenged to dance... I muthafuckin danced"
Did we just witness Eugene fail?
Does anyone else find it funny that eugene always goes for the hardest option
I love how they didn't even mention they went to gay bars the whole night haha
damn eugene always looks good
I like the way Keith says toe nails lol
This is exactly what ballet dancers feel like when we take off our pointe shoes
zack has the same jacket as me LMAO
Heels are a "hot, fancy thing you get to do"? SInce when do people "do" heels?! :)
heels don't hurt that much wtf
yo he almost got hit by a rolls royce did anyone notice that
I could run a marathon in Zach's 'heels'
Drinking and party vids r the best
Live stream of giraffe giving birth on my channel!! Link is in my newest videos description!! Comment your favorite color in the comments for a subscribe to your channel
Zach Those are not heels those are chunky boots
Eugene looks better in heels than I do
When Eugene dropped it like it was hot lol
I don't think Eugene is hot. hears loud, shrieking cry of girls in the distance charging towards my house
I got the same as Eugene, and let me tell you that those are a living nightmare. 
I love em tho and I wear them as soon as I spend the night out
"I got catcalled" 

I think that when that guy said 'welcome to the real word' he thought you were a drag queen or something and stepped on your toe to show you that if you were gonna wear heels as a guy then you'd get beat up....Why is no one in the comment section addressing this?
Ned's outfit is SO nice!
I need that "Keith and Ned and Zach and Eugene" shirt!! @ 4:16
haha here at 59,843
"but i look hot"
Zach had it easy, those aren't really even heels
I liked Eugene's heels the most, because they made him bend over repeatedly. #booty
Zach chose wisely
They all look fabulous! But I love Zach's shoes the most and he was the smartest of all them also the cutest! 😘
Eugene and zack looked amazing in high heels
How to be Ned:
"My Wife"
"Does it make my butt look good?"
Ankle Boots is more Eugene's style
did eugene get that one dancing chicks number is the real question
I've never been so attracted to Eugene
Zach had it so easy! Those were everyday boots while Eugene was rocking those Lady Gaga level stilettos and they lasted the same time
High Heels on men look so freaking attractive
Eugene ur Goddamn hot🔥🔥
I wear 6 inch heels and I am 10
Yeah, this is why I rarely wear heels.
Eugene is crazy
Why does Eugene always look hotter then me.
This has been done about 700 times, think of some new relevant stuff like maybe girls try coal mining because that's a bit more of a struggle then wearing pointy shoes
EUGENE!!!!!!!!!!! OH MY GOD
I died at eugene's dancing
Ned looks like those guys that have boats in ten Mediterranean. 
Keith looks like that mom at their child's every performance and event at school 
Zach looks like a trendy, normal mom/woman 
Eugene looks like that girl that can do everything like a boss.
Who loves buzzfeed?
it's the give it a whirl fuckers
if you got no new ideas , don't do anything
Random fact: Heels were actually made for men.
I have to say: Zach looked really good in heels
"nope not wasted, just wearing heels" Yesss...!
Nice throwback to the og try guys vids
Nice
all could walk better than i ever will with our without heels.
6:05 "It's fun to dance on the floor" made me laugh idk why
I think Ned and Keith stopped cuz it was a stripper-bar and they have a girlfriend!! lol
kitten heels & boots? nah man. Eugene and Ned did it right.
also Ned went through the ringer that night, props to him
Zach's Heeled boots look like something guys should wear normally. They look great on him! Does anyone agree?
Zach got the easiest ones, Eugene got the prettiest ones
"who's that man, walking down the street with those delicate feet- it's zach"
i wanna see eugene with a girlfriend
Eugene looks great idk if im lesbian anymore
"My T'nails"- Keith
"im just trying to get home without a broken ankle" me ecerytime i wear heels😂
of course eugene wore the most extreme shoes.
All of them lasted longer than i ever would in heels
Buzzfeed you have already made a video like that please please you need sleep
i want zach's shoes
0:03 oh man... but you always do!!
the trt guys try quince dresses
Oh mah god my feet actually started hurting halfway through this video. I feel you guys.
I need Eugenes T-Shirt like now!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
They would put Eugene in the thumbnail for me to click eo fast and like so fast.
"Six inch heels he walked in the club like nobody's business"
Rip. Just rip.
heels might look nice but theyre so bad for you
bootie heels are the easiest to walk in in my opinion
does anyone know where zach got his heels?
Neds heels​ are cute
Aaaand this is why I wear platform boots instead of heels!
Don't watch this video with a facial mask on!!! You won't be able to keep a straight face lmao 😂 😂 😂
Eugene's dance killed me  XD
I looked at Zach's outfit and bust out laughing because that's exactly what I wear on a night out.
Eugene would've made it with 4 inch heels for sure
Did anyone else like 2:32 ?😄😄, oh and has anyone else missed the try guys ?😭
zack got lucky with his shoe
yaaaaaaay
This wasn't really fair, Eugene had it the worst by far
That weird feeling you get in your heels after taking your high heels off.. Like your sinking into the ground 😂
Always wear heels with a platform, wedges or a thick heel😂
Anyone wanna hang out?
"I may have made a terrible mistake... but I look hot" me everything I wear heels lol
Damn Eugene got the worse high heel, I fell sorry for him.
I just love it when Ned brags about his butt <3
Eugene held it down!  😂🙌
all the try guys get handcuffed together for 24 hours
"My Fiance painted my toenails"....so is keith gay or what?
Zack's heels are what I wear every day haha and keith's are so lowww... Eugene is the real hero with hot as hell 6 inch daggers!
Is it just me who got worried that they would step on glass when they were barefoot next to a dumpster or walking home?
I'm female and let me tell you I don't look good in heels and these people do LIIIIKE!!!!
dammit they look better than me wearing heels
I'm a short girl and I wear heels all the time. Even to school
Of course Eugene looks the best in heels
EUgene is so fly he gets girls while strutting like Queen Bee
I wish it was a test every men had to go thru  XD
the best way to explain why girls keep wearing heels
 ¨my toes are bleeding but I look hot"
The old try guys videos are back!! :DDDD!!!
Damn!!! That booty though @ 7:47
As soon as I saw the title of this video I knew Eugene would have the tallest ones.
And beyonce dances on them for 2 hours while singing
XD Neds Wife...
Eugene's heels don't even fit, which makes it even more painful
The Abby lol
eugene is literally hot with anything
EUGENE!!!!!
I love you guys :D
ned's but looked great tho xD
and that girl who danced over Eugene girl you daring ;)
I Would Wear Zachs High Heels
Would legit wear Zach's shoes
more of the same 😖
They look like penguins waddling
I want Zack's shoes :D
Zach's legs looked amazing
Eugene is thicc
Zach is literally me when Eugene started to mothafuckin dance : "WHAT IS HAPPENING"
My feet hurt just by watching them wear heels 😂
that's my dad on Wednesdays
U guys can twerk better than I can tbh rofl
I'm a woman who doesnt own heels. I go dancing in my Nikes. 😀 And yes Eugene does look good in those heels! I probably walk sideways in those if I wear them.
Eugene looks great!
When Ned threw out the shoes my heart sunk.
Ned is hot
I'm a women and i can't use high heels all nigth
The best part is the fact that I wear Eugene heels for modeling...
"But I make these high heels work" -beebo
i have never clicked so fast.
I see you using that EDO typeface.
Ned looks so cute
Where can i find the shoes zach is wearing??
and again Ugene is trying to lok sexy Ned is trying to imitate his wife Zach is the cute one and Keith is just funny XD
YAAAAAS SLAAAAY, this is before I even see the video
I actually want those ankle boots zack has lol
Eugene killed me in this video😂😂😂😂😂
neds outfit is sooo cute and so feminine 😂😂 And zach looks so hooottt and cool THE HECK ❤❤❤
lol when I wear heels I always bring sandals in my purse or bag so I can change when I am done dancing or clubbing :P
i was dying at eugene dancing
Try guys: so what advice do you have for us??
Ariel: don't.
OMG Eugene
....Eugene Slays Everything 😂😭
Zack had it WAY to easy 😂
that toosh has got the push
when I tried on the dagger heels I cringed.. ouch
Ned looks pretty good in those grandma heels
Well they wear it better than I do. Sometimes I wonder about these boys
"These high heels are so tall, they'll muthafucking kill you"
I totally agree Eugene
Taehyung will be good at this. ;p
Zack is wearing the boots on the wrong feet LOL
They match their personality
I LOST A BET TO A GUY IN A CHIFFON SKIRT, BUT I MAKE THESE HIGH HEELS WORK.
sweet jesus christ...  buzzfeed made eugene gay...
I have heels I
Zack honestly rocked those boots.
this is why i dont wear stilettos. WEDGE FOREVER!
Their calves look good
I would sell my newborn child to be the girl dirty dancing w Eugene
They still pull of high heels better than I do
I seen korean women do dishes and house chores in them. LOLs.

''because they're so tall, they'll motherfucking kill you." brb dying
Painted my tnails
Zach looks pretty good with his heels. He should wear ankle boots more often.
that crouch at 9:03 GIRL I BEEN THERE
I love the try guys
i wear sneakers out #converse4life
isn't it just torture?
EUGENE'S DANCE OMLLL
Just watching the video hurts my feet
9:06 Eugene looks sooo adorable hahaha
Omf Eugene
I walked in heels as a dare once... then I started running in them 😏 that's when I found my hidden talent 😂
😱💕This is so cool, I wish people would try different fashions more (probably less painful ones though)😂❤️
Am I the only one who loves Eugene so much I skip to the parts that he is in?
zachs shoes are my everyday winter shoes
I laughed so hard , i can't think straight XD
Ned is me "They make my butt look good"
gosh I would toats date eugene and his dancing skills in heels
OMFG I CANT 😂😂😂😂😂😂AHAHAHHAHAHAHWHAHA
ZACH!
You cheater!
when eugene can pull off anything better than you ever will
Subscribe to my channel and like the comment and I'll subscribe back!!!
"They get taller! I get shorter!" That is total logic!!! 😂😂😂
Dammit Eugene stop being hot! (Don't actually. Plz)
I feel like Eugene took a dancing w/ high heels class or something...
the dagger strikes
"My feet are on the dirty ground and I don't care" I feel you!
eugine you have a dangerous weapon on your feet
On Halloween I had 4 inch heals and I walked around for 3 and half hours well trick or treating
No fair Eugene looks good in everything
I lost a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt 
But I make these high heels work
Who else wants to dance with Eugene? ;3
definitely took YEARS of heel wearing before the pain was no longer there.  but thats because im sure theres some nerve damage, cant feel all ma toes 🤗
I was staring at their asses in the beginning-
I'm ten and I can walk better than them combined
omg I pay to watch eugene  dance
Omg I loveeeeeeerr Zacs heels they r soooo lush where were they from ???
Don't read myy name
Zach could actually wear those and they would look like normal boots
Ok but I NEED to find Zachs shoes 😍 anddd of course Eugene looks hot 😑
why can't I drop it low like Eugene 😣
Zach, my boyfriend, is gorgeous. he just doesn't know yet.
I told you time and time again
I'm not as think as you drunk I am
I have the same boots as Zach 😂
I love the ankle heel boots
DOES ANYONE ELSE HEAR THE MOZART REQUIEM NEAR 2:30
lmao as a woman i literally cannot wear heels they hurt waaaaaaaay too much!! i'm already 5'9 tho so its not like i need the extra height lmfao
Ok, but can we talk about how fierce Zach looked???
Tbh they look cute in their shoes😂😂
The boots were nothing thoo like it's not even fair
what's the point
I love the look of heels and the way they make you feel, but I have chronic pain so there is no way I can wear those damn things anymore.
totally dig zach's look, heels and all
They re looking hot  😂😂
Is Brendon a secret try guy?
Zach actually looked really good in his heels xD
Each one of them looked really good! even though they ended up in pain haha
Eugene looked better in heels than I ever have wtf
i am LIVING for eugene dancing and getting down in those heels
How sweet! Keith's fiancé painted his nails!
This video made me realize that Eugene twerks alot
Eugene looks so goood
where can I get that tee shirt that says their names on it like the one eugene was wearing??
i aspire to pull off everything i wear like eugene
I liked zach shoes those are the only ones I'd wear
damn eugene knows how to really drop it low
respect. i never wear heels. just never. im the practical over fashion type of person. however, this video is genuinely entertaining.
When they look better in heels than you do...😂😂
LISTEN EUGENE. STOP BEING SO PERFECT IT'S NOT FAIR😫
Zack looked pretty good in those shoes.
what the heel are they up to next?
Those boots looks good on Zach's outfit
I identify with Eugene so hard because I also wear freakishly tall heels (I'm average but all my friends are at least 6 inches taller) and am also stubborn so I don't want to give up.
Let's be real they all rocked those heals, but Zach rocked those heals the best(?) and I also want them even tho I can't walk in them
Eugene is serving sass on the dance floor
i lov the try guys!!!!!
I love watching Eugene take on 6 inches.
Was it just more or did Zach look pretty attractive in those heals?
eugines dance killed me
they look better in heels than I ever have tbh
I honestly liked Zachs outfit
Eugene looks so good in heels
Why does Eugene look good in anything even heels
love the classic try guy vibe of this video. keep it up!!
Didn't Buzzfeed make a similar video before??????
dang, they rock those heels!
I love Eugene so much
I love the try guys
Sooo Eugene is gay, right?
I love le tryguys.
hilarious
To be honest the only good thing about Buzzfeed is the Try Guys.
Damnit, Eugene, what CAN'T you do???? on a side note, this is really sweet of y'all to do this. Maybe it can start a conversation about changing some fashion rules.
Try guys get their faces beat (makeup)
Why is it that men can make everything look good without trying?
Zach kind of cheated lol
This got me shook and bald.
looks like they got gay vibes from them heels lol
Ankle boots DON'T COUNT
Zach's heels are the best!!,  Eugene what were you thinking? lol
Why do they all look so good with heels on?!
Eugene is just always 😍😍😍😍
Eugene's tshirt with all their names on 😍
Worth it plus try guys. Love my sunday mornings.  thx buzzfeed ♡
Beauty is PAIN
this is what happens when you lose a bet to a guy in a chiffon skirt
a ladylike and a try guys video all in one day? wow
Damn poor guys 😅😅😂
A TRY GUY VIDEO THATS FREE ..... WHAT YEAR IS IT???
Ned looked really good in this video!
Eugene dancing thO
Damn Eugene!
can I be the girl dancing with Eugene please? oh my god. Zach really had the most comfortable heels though,  they're shorter with the thicker heel, so they're the easiest to walk in.
those booties dont look tht bad on him..he should actually wear thm to add inches to his height ..just seems normal
My mom has 6 inch heels 👠 that she wears everyday! Lol! She wears 7-8 inch heels for parties!
Keith and new in the same shirt
Keith was so excited about his painted toe nails 😂 I love it
lol I have those same exact ankle boots
Of course Eugene chose THOSE shoes! He's so extra™!
Heels were traditionally made for men back in the day.
Kudos Eugene. Wearing 6 inch heels is brutal!
The fact that Eugene went all out while dancing in heels gives me hope that I won't "flat out" at prom
Eugene's dancing.... oh my lord o_o
There should be dude heels
Eugene KILLED IT
yaass guck it upp😏💯🔥
Basically the most feminine and un-masculine guys you will ever see
Yasssss Eugene, those dagger heels are hot 🔥🔥🔥
Eugene is sexier than ever
Eugene doing a bend and snap in heels is my aesthetic
OH ....MY.....GOD LMFAO!
Who chooses the highest heels? Eugene.
Whose butt looks best when wearing heels? Eugene's.
Who looks best all in all? Eugene.
Who is killing the girls? Eugene.
Damn this guy!
Zach had the right idea.
didnt they already do this (or at least some men did on buzzfeed)
Anyone else ship Eugene and the girl at 6:24?
I see Eugene I click
Try Guys, Ladylike, Worth It. Please complete the list with just one more video, Unsolved Mysteries.
THOSE DANCE MOVES BY EUGENE THOUGH.
Lol if they had Zach's heels they would have lasted.
"Welcome to the real world", WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN WTF NED DOESNT DESERVE THAT
when you're 12 and like and can walk in heels
eugene dancing in heels. my dream came true
Zach looked great! They all did. :)
I love guys that do things like this ♥
When you dont need a nofication cause u are 24/7 on youtube😎
THIS IS SO RELATABLE! 😂😂😂
Eugene is so extra
it's easier to walk on heels when you're shorter, it's why zach did the best. if ned's heels were on the same level of comfort as zach's he would've lasted longer too
i feel like eugine is gay af
Eugene killing it as always.
I live Zachs shoes
When Eugene is sexier than you'll ever be. :)
those shoes look great on zach 👌
Advice for us: don't😂😂
I just love The Try Guys
Wedges are where it's at 😂
ZACH'S HEELS WERE THE BEST
Omfg Keith's getting married

EUGENE, ARE YOU RELATED TO KIMORA BLAC???

Eugene slaying in them daggers 😂
I'm 12 and I wore 6inchs for about 6 hours once while walking all day my feet didnt hurt at all
Ned  and Eugene 😯😍
Zach had no excuse
Eugene got down harder than I've ever seen anyone in the entire world get down
I CLICKED ON IT WHEN IT WAS "NO VIEWS." THE VIDEO STARTS AND IT'S 80K WHAT THE HECC
"I may have made a terrible mistake ... but I look hot ."

0:57 "Did I flush the toilet"

They are the reason I still watch Buzzfeed.
they're not walking properly
Eugene is literally the embodiment of being extra and savage. Like what. And he's always out there doing the most possible, like wtf six inches.
Whhaat! what was that on Keith's feet, slippers? baby heels!?
Ankle boots do NOT count >.>
Omg Eugene's feet at the end of the night 😱😱😱😱😱😱.

"But I look hot"

Hi

Eugene in this video is hilarious!!!!!
why does eugene always look hot no matter what he is wearing?
packs shoes are gorgeous
EUGENE
Haven't even started the video and I already know Eugene is gonna work those heels
I would wear what Zach has but not what Eugene has on. Those six inch heels are a no go for me.
Ned is really annoying me lately
😂
nope not wasted just wearing heels
honestly I don't know how I feel about the try guys anymore, I use to love them but I've discovered a new side to zach and keith, not a good one, and now I can't unsee it...I still love ned and eugene though
I'm a cobbler . You'd be surprised how many men wear heels . :p
"Does it make my butt look good?"

Wow. Flashback to the weird underwear vids they did.
I LOVE YOU...oh wait you guys aren't aloud to interact with us.
"What advice do you have for us tonight?"
"don't"
Eugene looks so good what the heckk
They all still look hot👌
Zach's heels looks most comfortable.
" what advice do you have for us" 
" don't." LMAO FACTS THO😂
I was wondering why I hadnt seen this video before then I realised it was just barely uploaded.... whoopsies
who thinks they were posting videos a lot
eugene is so extra
hi
Hi ._.
welp... I think they finally died inside 👠
They walked better and lasted longer then me...I've failed as a woman😓😢😢😢
I prefer Dager Pumps. I may stumble and fall, but it's worth it.
I guess their pain tolerance will go sky HIGH.



Yes, I know, terrible pun.
I'm a feminist and only sexually identify as an attack helicopter
if it's shorter than 4 inches, it's not even "high" heels
But they weren't drunk.
Promise it would have gone 10x worse if they were pissed!
i was just thinking when are the the try guys going to post a new video
