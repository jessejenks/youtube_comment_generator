I am decently interested in japanese culture and like anime. I don't try to fap to it or try to learn japanese.
I guess I'm half weeaboo. I am learning to speak it because I want to, but I do pronounce it wrong sometimes. I really love anime, but I don't think characters are my wifus. I don't cosplay them too. I do go crazy when people talk about anime that I like and talk about why I like it.

My friends made me watch this saying I'm a weeaboo. Now I sit in silence.

Everyone gets shit.
my favourite anime is Barney
There's also minecraft players in minecraft forums use anime profile pic and they act anime that I actually deleted the forum
Well f ima weaboo
at 0:08 you said : ‰ªäÊó•„ÅØ„Åô„Åî„ÅÑÈù¢ÁôΩ„ÅÑ„ÇÇ„ÅÜÊïô„Åà„Å¶„ÅÇ„Çã„Çà„ÄÇThat's not grammatically correct. To me it sounded like "today i to teach you guys awesome interesting too." (the more literal translation) You used two adjectives "sugoi" (amazing) and "omoshiroi" (interesting) in the same sentence without the proper conjugations, which if you were trying to say "I will teach you guys something amazing and fun" or "amazingly fun" you would say: ‰ªäÊó•„ÄÅ„Åô„Åî„Åè„Å¶Èù¢ÁôΩ„ÅÑ„Åì„Å®„ÇÇ„ÅÜ„Åä„Åó„Åà„Å¶„ÅÑ„Çã„Çà„ÄÇ
I love filthy frank
Looking at other uploads of this video, I see that the blurred image at 8:47-8:50 was some guy with his manga books. I assume he didn't want Frank using his image. Makes some sense. Now that blurred image is gonna be a hell of a distraction.
Seinfeld is the best anime I've ever watched.
my nigga
i studied japanese for 4 years and i still cant remember shit
I think we can all agree that Blue's Clues is the best anime
Everyone in the comment section is either freaking out about all the people with anime pro pics, or are trying to argue that they're not a weeaboo
notice me chin-chin
so you don't care if i watch hentai or just watch and like anime XD
Rick and Morty best anime ever
Weeboos... Sigh Disgusting...
how about have a marriage with me
filthy frank(Legend)
i fucking hate all the bragging weeaboos. they are the most triggering thing.
i changed my profile pic for this reason
im 25% Japanese
weeaboo david
sheeh
Weeaboos are so fucking sensitive.
This was my first Franku video.
Fuck you Frank! Important video playlist is the pinnacle of anime.
pfg
"Cause you know i get all that poosy, and it is scrumdidlydumtios"
So my classmate is half-japanese I call her half-weaboo is that right frank?
I may like anime and some Japanese culture (holds up flame shield), but these losers have to stop obsessing over this one little country like it's a god. Have some respect to your own nation and appreciate it. And this comment section is filled with assholes and trolls that attack any person who just happens to like something from Japan and call them a weeaboo. Man, people have to take a joke (I'm talking to you actual weeaboos as well.)
HE KNOWS JAPANESE!! WEEABOOSEPTION
My favorite anime is PINK SEASON
Oh, man I can't believe how close I was to being a weeaboo. I used to really love anime, I have a lot of anime songs in my phone and I get offended when I hear people say anime is cartoon. It's a good thing most anime today got shittier, I got really tired fast.
My favorite anime is World History (Anyone get the reference ;3)
Your Japanese is so good when you actually talk, and btw your Japanese voice sound so good
My favorite anime is:
Naruto , Boruto , Tokyo Ghoul , Assassination Classroom , AOT.




1. Does having the mask of kaneki and the headband and the kunai/shuriken from naruto count being a weeaboo? ;-;
Didn't this video used to have 30 mil views, and be the most viewed video? Now the Best Of PInk Guy is and it makes no sense to me...
Lol wut a weaboo
4:27 " key word borderline" #okay
weeaboos pounding on keyboards apparently: JHGSDFGJVSDJGKdscjHKBVDSJKHBSDZ VJHKBSDZV JHKBVSDVJH MZSK,JLXFLX FCLKD

I have a katana but I actually use them I don't collect them
lol
„Ç´„É´„Éú„Éº„Ç§ Áî∞‰∏≠ „Åï„Çì
CORY IN THE HOUSE
I'm here
1:30 Toy story is the best anime
oh my gowd
I have a Katana but that's because I've been fascinated in them for over a decade. I didn't get it cause I watch anime. Does that make me a Weeaboo? This is a serious question btw.
i thought weeaboos were dickless nerds that watch henti
this whole channel is like WTF?
He doesn't say, "Are you ready to have some fun? I sure am!" at the beginning. He says, "There are two Jews in my closet. They're both dead."
Hi
This is horsecrap, everybody know Baywatch is best hentai anime ever made in human history! PERIOD!!!
My favorite anime is Shrek 3
supersick bossssss ‚Ç¨:
every guy in the grade above me watches this anime called cum guzzlers 18 gay edition and makes a big deal out of it, i'm just gonna check it out.
My favorite anime is Bizaardvark.
i learned japanese to visit family that really doesn't make me a weaboo yet people call me a weaboo...
masturbating to 13 year old Japanese girls doesn't make you a pedophile cuz their japanese "animationsss and [you're] a human"...c that, i referenced to one of ur songs XD
masterbating to cartoon 13 yr old japanese school girls isnt pedophilia, cuz THEIR JUST AN ANIMATIONNNN AND HE'S A HUMANNNN
those fucking dumbass weaboos with their anime profile pics
Legit Burns bro... still, Weebs are ded to normal anime fans and Japanese culture supporters
My friend sent me to this video in hopes to cure me of my Nekopara addiction. It didn't work. HELP
I like, anime, the japanese culture itself, the food, 
I dont get body pillows, i dont, do about 98% of the things mentioned in this video....
then you said they are both dead not i sure am!
you didnt say ready to have some fun you said theres 2 people in ur closet im japanese
What is under that one cencor?
The first thing seen in heati is cum      My favorite word.  üçÜüí¶üçë
scrolling through the comments for anime profile pics
I hate weeaboos. People should be themselves of who they are, instead of trying to be like "I'm gonna learn from anime oooo" Those people are annoying. FilthyFrank is the real expert of Japanese culture.
Well thanks to filthy franks I now have to witness cringy over used "kys weeaboo" comments every goddamn day. Even people I know that watch one anime will be attacked by some asswipe 10 year olds saying "kys drink bleach dum weeaboo" and hose same kids are too fucking braindead to know what weeaboo even means
What if Filthy Frank and Brandon Rogers did a video together?
Personally, I think 2 girls 1 cup is the best anime ever made.
I love anime, but my favorite anime of all time is Arthur.
the best anime is defo's the fresh prince of bel air!!!!!!!!!!!

My Favorite Anime is Law & Order
Anime
im my moms attic? they evolved or this world devolved oh god noooooooooooooooooo
I originally thought Frank was white with just a double eyelid, just like Jennifer Lawerence.
I am from India , Recently an Anime channel was shut down due to poor viewership rating and was replaced by a Kids TV channel. Weaboos are pretty angry up here , they are flagging and reporting the Kids TV channel Facebook page and cursing them . Even though they are Indian they are calling Indian animated shows poor and shitty . They are indeed losers just as described by filthy Frank Sir , They are jobless , lazy ass people. God save us from weaboo
my favorite anime is jay jay the jetplane
he looks full Japanese when he's normal filthy frank and when he's safari man, but kinda looks Spanish or something when he is pink Guy or salamander man. it's crazy how his face changes
when even Filthy Frank thinks you're unhygienic you must really stink so bad
I realized today that I am the definition of weeaboo
Wanna see my katana collection? <3 <3
4:34 This is my I wear headphones
I don't consider myself a weeb but I understood ever word he spoke in Japanese üòÖ
Can I type the fuck out of a comment here? Thanks:



Now, we all know that "otakus", or whatever, can like Japanese pop culture, but that doesn't make them a weeaboo. HOWEVER, even if they WERE a weeaboo, so fucking what? If an immigrant applies for citizenship in the US, would you call them something like "American wannabe trash"? Weeaboos can always apply for citizenship, so shut the fuck up. Yes, there are annoying weeaboos. Just like how there are annoying otakus, annoying bronies, annoying gamers, annoying memers, and annoying members of EVERY FUCKING FANBASE. That doesn't mean you can just make a generalization of all fans and call them annoying trash. Going back to my first point, notice how Frank doesn't say anything against the otakus. He gets that liking anime doesn't make you trash. Yes, the people who are all "OMG SO KAWAII!!!1one", they are annoying. But most fans are just "I like anime." I say this because all of you Filthy Frank dicksuckers attack anyone with a god damn anime avatar, especially the ones who say ANYTHING critical about Filthy Frank. Filthy Frank is an asshole. He's cancer, he's cringe, he's mentally fucked up, but he knows when to play the trash card. You guys just call anyone who looks at you the wrong way a weeb. Now, if they were typing something like "ur gay u hav no life", fuck them. But what if they typed their opinion of Frank's crassness? Are you really attacking them because they like anime, or are you just attacking them because you disagree with them? Next time you're about to call someone weeb trash, ask yourself that question. Also, please remember that you're about to call someone trash on a video made by a guy who ate Pewdiepie's ass hair.

What am I doing? I'm trying to be reasonable on a fucking Filthy Frank video!
mmmmmm slap my ass and call me moist, that's a good Japanese voice!
ffs my neighbors can hear your screaming too, listen to the fight without watching it.
I have never laughed so hard at a YouTube video üëåüòÇ

Love that voice crack
There is something I don't understand though people call me a weeaboo I don't think I'm Japanese and there something I don't understand people that are Japanese can love things in their culture and we can't love things in their culture that's pretty messed up

 Signs you are infected: you have a sword collection, you have a body pillow, your studying japanese eventhough your probably not even going to japan.
Weeaboo Jones looks pregnant
my favorite anime is Thomas the tank engine
When somebody screams WEEABOO

The police cars be like

8:45 WHY DID YOU BLURR IT!! you fuckin weeaboo
Cowboy tanaka should be a new characther
some reason filthy frank sounds cool while speaking Japanese. but english ya know
I think the only anime I've ever seriously enjoyed was "One Punch Man," because it mocks other animes.
I like anime and manga but not too much. Some girl pronounced manga man ga and it was awful ;-; I didn't wanna look like a weeaboo doe
Filthy Frank should got to McDonalds. And McTear a manga in half

You better shut up. I will have you know I love japan and I'm gonna go to Tokyo University when I grow up. Stop acting like people can't assimilate. I can speak japanese fluently and I learned it through the internet and anime, so you can just shut the fuck up. I wish I could make you die by writing your name in my deathnote. You need to let people be who they're going to be. And there's noting wrong with dying your hair and having body pillows.

The intro is way more funny if you actually understand Japanese XD
I don't discriminate... I don't give a fuck about anybody

No worries boi, I'm the first non-weeb with and anime avatar, I don't even know the anime my avatar's from. Sorry bout the weeaboo problem
WEEABOOS ARE LEMON SCENTED
pffft
Weeaboos should all be forcibly collected to camps where they would have to work without pay. And maybe learn how to concentrate. The camps would probably be situated around central Europe.
So many people in the comments saying, "even though I like anime and have an anime profile pic doesn't mean I'm a weeaboo!". Stfu yes it does.
my favorite anime is the incredibles
"My waifu is coming to life" I'm dying üòÇ
meh, because of Life Of Boris, im changing from a weeaboo to a slavaboo

It's been a year but I stand by my first statement: "Best subscribe of my life"

The weeaboo song, made me genuinely sad, thinking about these people wasting their lives. And that song.
ANIME IS FUCKING STUPID
Hey Frank, why is that one part blurred out?

"there are two foreigners inside my closet"
Question, what if your already Asian?
Anime is a cartoon.

What happened? Why is that one part blurred out now?
My favorite anime is the one with... um the... Japanese people.

I'm not a weeaboo, I just like Naruto
I'm Brick Tamland. People seem to like me because I am polite and I'm rarely late. I like to eat ice cream, and I really enjoy a nice pair of slacks. Years later, a doctor will tell me that I have an IQ of 48 and am what some people call "mentally retarded."
8:45-8:50 Why is it censored there?

6:58 best jumpsacare of 2017
what is he talking about?
I like watching anime and I learn Japanese in highschool, does that make me a weeaboo? ( im not japanese)
Is it bad that I actually want to learn Japanese?
you know, I think the video is hilarious all except for the use of the word "faggot" I dont think people realize gow offensive it is. Believe it or not, its basically the "N" word but for a different group of people.
Lel it's so true though like I can mess with the anime shit but can't be going that far with what them weeabo's do besides your just trying to be honest with people and honestly if they gots issues then they need to go get a reevaluation on their life.
2:46 was the best part

:Cory in the house
We where visiting a college and this one girl raised her hand and asked, " Is there a class on learning the japenese language." And she wears like japenese anime shirts and talks about it and I wanna kill them
Some of these kids at my school are weeaboos! LOL!!!!
Ok ok ok, there's this one kid at my school who, get this, calls me a fucking Weeaboo and a fucking hypebeast just because I watch anime. I honestly don't even know a single word of Japanese. Just because I think attack on titan is a fucking amazing show doesn't mean I own kunai knives and body pillows...
are these those kids these days who watch those weird chinese cartoons?
My preschool teacher would shove lego's up my tight virgin ass
I'm not a weaboo I just like good porn jeez...
My favorite animes consist of Johnny Quest, King of the Hill and The Andy Griffith Show
My favourite anime is Barney & Friends
Wait am I a weeaboo then? I like to learn Japanese language and I was thinking about going to japan one day because I think it's an interesting country. I also wanna visit Tokyo because of the bright and colorful light. I do watch anime but I don't watch obsessively.

hentai is better
I mean, I don't have an anime avatar, but my name is anime related. Do I still count as a weeb???
This Is kind of scary, I hope I haven't been contaminated by Weeaboos.
Anime is just trash
There is a pure white bitch at school(im white too) who wears a japanese schoolgirl outfit almost everyday and then theres a bunch of white ass "popular kids" who run around screaming scurt scurt and fucking telling people to look somewhere then screaming "BROKEN NECK!!" and if you could not tell its basically made you look but i dont want to look like a three year old edition this came out of nowhere but yeah

help me god
Check out my rocket launcher collection
Hey Bous
weebs are really creepy faggots who never get laid
what do you call a white girl that can run faster than her brothers?A redneck virgin
My best friend is a weeaboo... is there a center to help stop her addiction of calling stuff Kawaii, and acting like she knows the lyrics to Japanese songs, even I can't understand because none of them are real Japanese, which is a language I know I speak, and she tries to correct me despite the fact that she knows I can help her learn real Japanese?! ugh! and her name is actually Sakura Bloom! No fucking joke, it's her God given birth name! so just because of that, she believes she is Japanese! Help me get some sense into her!
That AOT bit is true. It's an awesome show. but, don't try to learn the Japanese language from it. Get practice from someone that actually knows the language. Like me! I'm from Aomori!
he changed the thmubnail not fair i thought new vid SHET NEGGGGGA!
The reason why people dislike is because they don't know frank is actually a normal person.
i hate kids with anime profile pictures
Hentai is ok... It's Loli that creeps the shit out of me.
You're not a pedophile if you're twelve
What's with the subtle thumbnail change, Frank?
Did this get recently edited?
We have the same eyebrows
I just wanted a peace of percys ass
Lost itüòÇ
This was fucking awesome man
House
Fuck off Franku-san I shower at least twice a week
Thank you far clarifying the definition of a weeaboo in the beginning of the vid, and also clarifying that not all people who watch anime is like this.  Some people just don't know the difference between a weeaboo and a regular person who watches anime.  That still won't help you getting hate, because there will always be stupid people.
We need to stop anime avatars
I have serious teeth pain, and this video made me laugh so hard, that I forgot that pain.
10:08 Why does he have a sponge-bob necklace?

I'LL STAB YOU WITH MY CHOKUTO BITCH AND IF YOUR FUKIN RETARDED AND DONT KNOW ANIME THEN THATS SASUKES SWORD ASSWHOLE MY BODY PILLOW COULD KICK YOUR ASS. Hehe it's just a prank boss
What I got from this is is that I can watch Hentai without being a Weeb.
he changes this video's dumbnail to a ugly ass weeaboo girl lamo
I've had so much sex with my body pillow that it stands on it's own now. 

Ah well.

Who's looking for weeaboos with anime avatars in the comment section
Did you change the thumbnail?
So since I just watch anime and sometimes cosplay but still embrace MERICA FUCK YEA, that doesn't make me a weaboo? Also I kinda want to visit Japan because it's a pretty place and i want to see the differences between MERICA and Japan. Am I a weaboo?
I like it how weeaboos write f*cking  paragraphs when you write a hate comment XD
SO MANY VOICE CRACKS
ironically enough i'm half- japanese myself who only likes the 90s Yuyu Hakusho [or ghost fighter]...yet i prefer good ole liberty and "running away to fight another day" over "dying for honor"... i love Mediterranean food and good ole pasta... have a hollywood russian accent and pretty much the only thing i want in japan is the walk in the cool breeze of the night... and convenience stores. not there for the anime... and pretty much prefer speaking in english because learning my 2nd language is fucking difficult...and a pain in the ass... but will give me assets and advantages says dad...

honestly i still the 70s disco afro culture with bellbottoms, huge collars, and swing

I do love Anime , but I don't spam japanese , or try to learn it.
I try to distance myself from "Weebs". I eat sushi from time to time. I don't eat it every month.

I accept the low level furrys. I slightly liked MLP , and I seriously hate weebs.
My profile picture is one of my favourite anime characters
anime is gay
I wanna move to Japan. to see papa franku
I'm the "dont talk shit about attack on titan" guy
Honestly, Fanbase ruined anime, especially these weeaboos and fangirls, I stopped watching anime as soon as these creatures started to spread around the community, "OMG ONII-CHAN ORE WA JAPANESE GUYS" 
Just piss off, I don't give a shit iif you disagree, it's as annoying as I'm saying it.
The fuck is wrong with your voice

The translations at the beginning of Filthy Franks video are incorrect. What he was actually saying, "Welcome everyone. Welcome to the Filthy Frank show. Today I have something exciting to tell you. I have two people captive in my closet. Both of them are dead."
i watched this while reading the google auto generated subtitles and your Japanese (ACCORDING TO GOOGLE)  was as accurate as riding a submarine made of screen doors
I cant be the only one who sees a different thumbnail
Dude I collect weapons and I can fucking use them.
I know this is late but I'm a waraboo because all the ww simulator s taught me Japanese

Why was the Thumbnail changed?
do one one furries plz
i like the character transition in your video, it's smooth, and the weebs in other country seems really really disgusting from the pic, i like the song, it's really really fuck the weebs up
I knew that there was something that turned me off on anyone buying weapon replicas. I'd be paying hundreds to thousands of dollars to cut my own hand off. All very good points that do you no good in online communities. Trust me... I tried, and felt like a dumbass lol. Don't get them started on the concept that anime is a cartoon. They were pissed lol. It was funny.
Notice how the thumbnail changed.
I'm the one who likes anime but not a weeaboobshits

Mabey if you stopped pretending to be us you would get a girl or someone other than you're mum for fucks sake grow up you dorty wanna be weeaboo. Or i will meet you and show you how not to mess with you okay good.

In Japan, they don't say "I love you" they say " „Åô„Åπ„Å¶„ÅÆ„É¶„ÉÄ„É§‰∫∫„ÅÆÊ≠ª ' Which means, "I hate everybody today, but you -- You I can stand with" and I think that's beautiful!

My fav anime is Sausage Party.

I only use this profile picture for meme trash, I have no opinion on anime
hey b0ss
i like anime and i can speak some japanese becuz of my friend and i like the food fucking delicious candy and soda
Im osermus bin lerdus and I aprove this message.

another thing I want to say is that please don't call yourselves weeaboos because it's actually offensive to the Asian culture because that you're pretty much saying that you're like all of them saying that they're like anime
that song was awesome that you just made
That slideshow made me so sick. Find some real pussy like my man Frank.
My favorite anime are Toys R US commercials.

My Favourite anime is Thomas the tank engine
In the long run Animes are still better, they are focused on all ages and their characters are much better designed than any western shit thats why they keep dominating worldwide. Even the videogames that are made by Japan have much better character design for both males and females.
9:57
PeanutButterGamer is a weeb confirmed!
I only like watching anime so I guess Im not a weeabo...thank god.
I wanna move to japan. So I can get hit with a tsunami since I don't wanna live in this world
Anime is amazing, if you say otherwise then you're a faggot and should commit suicide.
Danke daf√ºr Iblali

when i was in highschool i called a girl a weeaboo because she brought her body pillow to school and she got mad and told on me (pussy) and the school couldn't decide to suspend me or not because they didn't know what a weeaboo was.

I like anime and I laughed at the video. I honestly don't mind if you say terrible things about anime because I don't have to take it seriously and I laugh anyway

YOU FUCKING NIGER KIYYYYSSSWS
i think my friend is a weeabo he dyes his hair and he always smells
This video is a blessing and curse.
Blessing because this is the best filthy frank video.
And a curse because people are now misusing the word "weeaboos" everytime.
I can't stop laughing. I'm just sitting here cackling like a fucking insane person. This video is great!
"just because you try to dress an act like a certain ethnic group, it doesn't mean you're that ethnic group."
i really like this quote because you can switch out the word ethnic with the word gender and it's still true
Papa franku :v

I watched this video about a month and a half ago and I still love it! Even though it's 3 years old I laugh at it to this very day. I had a friend who I didn't realize was a complete weeaboo until I saw the signs too late but I still love her even though we don't keep in touch anymore plus she was extremely intelligent(and I don't mean anime wise) for a 14 year old and I was pretty stupid. Nonetheless I love this video because it brings back so many good memories of one of my closest and smartest companions. I knew there where some benefits in Frank's videos deep, deep, deep down in there somewhere and I thank you.

I love you...I hate you

Don't talk shit about attack on titans,it's a really good show.
My friend owns a couple katanas, tries to learn Japanese, and has a couple of cheesy Japanese tattoos....

Should I be worried...?
filthy frank is a sertified memelord Lord like if you agree
UGH. I hate weeaboos. I'm an otaku, just because I love japanese culture and I respect it.
Is that one old man my grandfather BECAUSE I SWEAR IT IS
My friend said he was a weeabo.

I'm a great fan of anime,but i don't try to be Japanese,don't even try to learn the languase cuz itz useless for me,like Japanese culture as i like many other cultures around the world!I like anime,but i could like DC and Marvel instead!Is there a name for those guys?Btw this video is funny a fuck and double4anime is an embarassment for the anime community and should not be attached to it no matter what!!
wheres the subtitles... üòÉ (hilarious!)

I do watch anime ... Not a lot tho ... 

So I won't Whine like a lil bitch

heavy breathing Smashes keyboard Gets hit with reality check dies
"Prejudice equality." That's beautiful.
Cory in the house is the best anime üëå
Dad, when I grow up I want to be like you, a Porn Star in real life Hentai you Weeaboo.
at the beginning his voice sounded like a guy I just watched in hentai :/
I appreciate that he knows what a weaboo is, rather than just assuming anyone that watches anime is a weeb (thank ya, Frank ‚ô° :")
the last part was disgusting
My '24' year old Brother isn't a weeb, but he has 2 samurai swords, tbh, I think their fine though, since he isn't actually... a weeaboo xD
I love anime and not even I am this obsessed.
7710 weeaboos are offended because of this
thank God he knows the difference between a Weeaboo and a person who watches anime
Guess who is trying to get that 10 minutes
The Only Weeaboo I Like Is Daniul
Listen. I went to a Japanese market for the first time yesterday. And it was damn good. However, I don't try to speak Japanese and I hate anime. WHAT AM I?
my fav amine is thomas the tank engine
Initial D intensifies!!!!!!!!!
ur sick
why would anyone want to move to japan anyway? they're one of the most xenophobic contries. they probably won't even accept you into the actual country in the first place. even if you are allowed into the country, they are extremely strict and if you don't know the language perfectly, you probably won't ever get a job and you'll get discriminated as a non-japanese person. outsiders that praise japanese culture is absolutely hilarious, almost as bad as girls who leave their homes and join ISIS.
i agree with you @crazymadsmartguy
Plz be My Teach 

I HOPE TO 
CUS I CAN...

"konichiwa you magnificent bastards"-filthy frank

SAO is the worst anime that ever exists.
Like if u agree
0:09 for those who don't speak Japanese. He said there are two foreigners in his closet and I think they're dead......
Why did¬†you said "two dead jews in¬†my closet" in Japanese and didn't translated it.
You know, Papa Franku's right. Those people with the anime avatars are a cancer that's spreading throughout this world. We must gas them all.

Hey...I smell something.
im cold
My favorite anime is The Adventure Of Luckypie.
I learned how to speak Japanese from Frank's videos ...
Knights are more powerful than samurai.
Ironically my friend has a girlfriend and their are both weaboos, appearantly his girlfriend is pretty hot I mean I'd smash as hard a a hammer to a nail but she is younger than me so.




What... forget I said that.
a redneck virgin
6:19 That sounds like Welcome to the Black Parade. Why?

You ever just stop and think holy fucking Christ these are real people
Fox News is obviously the best anime you faggots, do you even have Rosetta Stone?
this is the best Vid on the Internet
Not every person that has an anime profile pic is a weaboo. (I'm not one though; I like anime, am interested in Japanese history, and actually learning a few sentences in Japanese, but I still respect my own culture and I do all of the things, listed above, in moderation.
it's all about the lolis man
corey in the house is not an anime
4:10 jesus fucking christ,I understood everything he said....
People like weeaboo's are so, so sad. 
Look, America is kinda shit. But that doesn't automatically make its citizens or culture shit.
Besides, do you seriously think they're that much better over in Japan? They make cartoons where even when the women consents, she still goes "No! No senpai! Stop!".
Also, tentacle monsters.

Stop it. Stop it now weeaboo's. It's okay to be USA. It's a nationality, not a fucking disease.
Franku-chan ;)
thanks for the definition I'M NOT WEEABOO! But i still love anime

The best anime ever is how it's made
This video's comments in a nutshell: Guy with an anime profile pic: "Lol at those weeaboos, I'm definetely not a weeb I just like anime" insecurity intensifies
listen I'm an otaku and im not a foolish i love watsh anime so much and i use to learn Japanese not from anime when i talk to my friend not like a foolish otaku anime lover and all my speech is for anime. that people in that photos who can call them a weebos becous they take the anime like a drugs... listen anime is life style you use to watsh anime becouse you love it but destroy that life style with that fucking shit its like a atomic bomb of drags. 
in the end  the anime is a animation its an artworks its a draw on a paper....
please understand. the anime is so amazing you can learn from the anime so much things like friendship, justice, wars, and so much thing...
ANIME IS A LIFE STYLE BUT DONT DESTROY THAT LIFE WITH AN ATOMIC BOMB OF FOOLISH PEOPLE AND NEET PEOPLE WHO DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE ANIME AND DESTROY THEM LIFE WITH THERE IDIOT FOOLISH THINKS.
My favorite anime character is Steve Harvey.

no one but you wants to go to Japan... Unless they are carying some atomic bombs then Americans will take a trip down their
my favourite anime is the filthy frank show
Fresh Prince of Bellair
is he Japanese
"it even stands on it own" xDDDD
I know a joke frank i am a basterd
how old?
Weeaboo Jones saved my life twice in battlefield 1 (revive).
His voice is so sexy.
filthy Frank is the best anime
wrote an essay about weeaboos.... got an A and got to read it in the front of the class... :l
Well, he hasnt touched salvadoreans.
he is a weeaboo
HowToBasic is my favourite anime
i just like anime.. not LOVE IT!
im a weeaboo so what
When I go to school and see kids trying to do jutsus...
I lost it when he said, "SEX INVERTEBRATES!" I don't know why though
you should check out melon pan, he is my favorite weabo
fuck those weebs are closing in on our position.......call in the Islamic terrorist
i've never laughed so hard to a rant in my life....good show bro good show.
7,620  people are weeaboos or triggered.
7K weeaboos disliked
damn son, my throat would be bleeding if i talk like that, chill bro
asians trying to be white are called amiibos :) they even decide to make game figures to make it seem less racist :)

Nerdsoft what are you funking gay
Hahaha anime people they fuck pillows
s e x   i n v e r t e b r a t e s
He scared off that pigeon.

My favourite type of ramen is meat pie.
100% accurate
I'm black and Jewish
From 0:10 it says something different in Japanese
"Theres 2 Jews in my closet"
"There both dead"
Jajaja OMFG!!! I'm fckn laughing a lot
konochdismdisicsj
I like the song
pink guy is my loli waifu
Wait. Does he actually know Japanese?
Checks Wikipedia
I guess so.
my favourite anime is Bangtan and EXO
Frank obviously spended 6 or 5  hours to do the intro
I think i am a japanese but its no use im here in philippines T^T what a shame ;-;
The sad part is that he may one of the only japanesse people I've seen on YouTube  that expressed there full opinion on this subject.Most of them keep quiet about it because they probably don't want to lose the revenue because one of the most prominent things Japan has gave to the US is in fact, anime so then they wouldn't want to lose sales.They made ME ME ME to try to tell us to stop but it just brought in more weaboos.Its like they are stuck in a economic bubble filled with weaboos and ramen.
I share the EXACT same opinion as frank does, I f@&*ing hate weeaboos, they disgust me, and screw them. I don't mind mind that people love anime, just as long as they don't do stuff like having sex with a body pillow until it begs for mercy. And going 'nyyaa' until my vital organs start leaking out of my ears. I instead watch Rick and Morty, cause that is some legit content.
"yAmEEEeEro!"


same
would i be a weeaboo if i lived in japan for two years?
Dont try to say you know anime if you don't know who filthy frank is 100% 100%
I've been learning Japanese for 4 years, I dont say that I am japanese, and I haven't watched Anime for about 5 years.
Hentai on the other hand, I watch that shit 24/7
Am I a weeb?
My favorite anime is Friday the13th
If u like satire content sub to me
i made the mistake of watching this at the airport without headphones
NOT ALL WEEABOOS ARE LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!
yes make fun of everyone/ everything BUT anime
Best Anime.
I order mcfurrys at McDonald's
i like  and watch anime but i am not a weeaboo
I love anime and all but....I'm not a weeaboo. you can come to my house if you want to see for yourself but I'm not a f**cking weeaboo. lol
did frank make the song at the end of the video??¬†was that him¬†singing
Well, I have 2 swords. One is a dao , a chinese sword, and the other is a katana, BUT I have been learning Kendo through real training and I'm learning a little bit of Iaido. So I know how to use swords, asian swords.
This kid in my Spanish class speaks no English only Spanish and idk if he knows another language but he's the biggest weeaboo bitch I've ever seen he literally only anime shit and other weird stuff liked all his shirts consist of anime or other weird shows.
My favorite anime is Steve Harvey.
ANIME SUCKS
8:40 is he giving birth?
Telltale signs of being a weeaboo are loving weapons and using an anime avatar, shit

I love anime. I just watch it in English dub just to piss off any weeaboos out there especially the insane weeaboos at comic con conventions. Keep in mind I do watch English sub but i like not having to read subtitles unless it is an OVA or an actual live action filmüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Corey in the House = best anime

everything went down hill at 6:05
The guy at 9:56 reminds me so much of Peanut Butter Gamer
I sexually Identify as an Anime. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of having a harem in which i dropped hot sticky loads on busty wifus. People say to me that a person being a anime is Impossible and I‚Äôm fucking retarded but I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm beautiful. I‚Äôm having a plastic surgeon install big eyes, censored penis and large cum sacks on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me ‚ÄúSenpai‚Äù and respect my right to not notice you. If you can‚Äôt accept me you‚Äôre a aniphobe and need to check your  privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.
Frank is Japanese right?
Yes, the strange yet common weeaboo has some very annoying traits, such as thinking that they speak Japanese because they know the word sugoi. They commonly use "desu" at the end of each sentence. For example, "Oh mi gosh, Naruto is sugoi desu!" They commonly watch mainstream anime and don't know any anime that aren't popular. I KNOW TOO MANY WEEBS
Anime is fucking gay
How does your voice feel after theese videos??
I had never typed this fast in my entire life
clears throught... sword art online..... attack on titan.... dragonball....insert anime title here...
my anime avatar is ironic.
Cory in the house is the best anime the rest are terrible.
I like anime I watch anime I like the genre butt then there's "Sasuke" real name troy
When filthy frank is the best anime
I am interested in Japan and anime but I am not rude or crazy about it
An americaboo Japanese person is something I'd fucking like to see. There must be balance in the universe.
holy crap you talk perfect anime and plus i really love your jokes m8 amazing
I Hate Weeaboo's

Filthy frank please be filthy for me in a rat cave

cory in the house isn't anime because its not Chinese
I am a proud American.
The song is great
anime is life
4:49 I do to
Frank's neighbor must think he's an autistic porn director with all the sounds he makes.
I don't fuckin understand Weeaboos. 
Like, seriously, if you love the culture so much, then leave the US and make it a better place. Hell, I'll even pay for a one way ticket there for you.
I like anime, but I'm not gonna go out and buy 17 kitanas, 43, throwing stars and 74 copies of "Neon Genesis Evangelion" to give one to every person I see while buying groceries.
Again, I do like anime(in fact I just finished The Devil is a Part Timer the other day), but weeaboos need to leave the US and the internet.
dude one of those weebs wad Christian western chandler
Asuna is my waifu
i study the official language of japanese NON weeaboo style. i mean i like anime but i'm nowhere as crazy as weeaboos who think they're japanese. p.s you're really funny lol
It's actually quite sad(
Why can't people collect weapons from other countriesLike go get a shotgun from Switzerland, it would kill someone way faster than a katana
the weaboo i know cuts herself she literally has an x in her arm and DIE just scarred there n all
u sound just like this rlly FUCKING annoying girl i know who is a weeaboo and an emo at the same time

phew lucky I don't watch anime
This is hilarious
so what happened to the two dead people in the closet?
I love this video people call me a weeaboo because I wear skirts but I started wearing skirts before I started watching anime meaning I am not a weeb and plus wtf is wrong with them thinking that every Japanese high school girl has either giant tits or flat tits and the they ALL love food or reading manga and that ALL Japanese high school boys buy porn magasines like wtf poeple
If I want to learn the language and respect the history and current culture of Japan yet am not obsessed to the point of complete ignorance, am I a Weeaboo?

At least weaboos are helping the manga/anime creators by buying their stuffs and not watching from illegal sites
I'm only a anime fan here, but why the fuck do these weeabos do weird things with waifu pillows and try to cosplay as anime characters
My avatars are usually my drawings. Someone called it a cartoon once. I wish. Lol.

.  .  . ANIME!!!!!! what ... i dont like anime i-it's just a hobby
Weeaboo's are religiously devoted to anime subtitles, and will go psycho if you ask them why they would rather read subtitles, or how they read them, and watch the video at the same time.

Weeaboo's.

Are.

Cancer.
Wh, Where, Where The Subtitles lmao üòÇüòÇ

They only ever think about going to Japan, not actually going to Japan. When I was younger, my weeaboo friend and I planned a trip to Japan once we were old enough to drink. When the time came and we had saved about 3k each, I told him it's time to plan the trip and buy some tickets. He decided he wanted to buy a gaming computer instead. WEEBS, man...

Weeaboos in China are much worse. They behave like radical Japanese nationalists instead of Anime funs. They think Japanese is the most high level race in the world and others are pigs.
Say something really insulting about ginger people.
Japanese people always sound like they're getting fucked really hard in the pussy
Do one about musically fucking hate seeing ten year olds fucking waving there hand in the air and changing fucking angles with there phone.
"A pigeon just landed on my--"

The last time I fucked a weeaboo my life got turned upside down.
my favorite anime is jimbles nutren
At the 1:54 minute mark I stopped the video, went to the youtube search bar, and typed "airpl".  And what was the first suggestion?  Airplane instruction videos from the 80's.  Not joking.

Youtube knows, YouTube knows.
something tells me your howtobasic
Can you make a video on weaboos that likes to predict the next anime episode? those kind of people really wind up on every anime lovers' nerve. They are like a bunch of junkies that cant wait for the next episode to come out.
ey b0ss
Hey Boss üòõü§ö
I lose it when he talks about getting a piece of Percy and Harold's ass
Hey Filthy Frank is your voice nautrully like that bro
Oh god...what Frank says at 0:11 is not 'Are you ready to have some fun? I sure am!' lol

He actually says 'There are two jews in my closet' 'Both are dead'
My favorite animes are Law and Order and Judge Judy
So he has two friends dead in his closet?
i love me some ramen
Sponsored by W.E.T. Weeaboo Exterminating tyrant
anyone notice that when the subtitles read "are you ready to have some fun" and "i sure am" he actually says "there are two bodies in my closet.. my dead parents"
I think the pigeon is a weeadoo and it hears Frank talking shit about weeadoos so it came to start becoming a window pecking warrior
No one knew this would start a revolution 6:57
My favorite anime is Full House
I agree with Frank. Cory in the House is my favorite Hentai. Pink Guy is my favorite anime character.

In my country, there are these people, I feel shame for them, for their parents feel sad. A funny man who forget history, forget the lineage, how funny it is.
7534 weeaboos do not realise they are shits
is the translation correct at what he says at the beginning of the video?
"If you own collection of weapons that you dont even know how to use, that's-that's a problem. You should notify your school." 
holy shit this is gold

Airplane instruction videos from the 80s XD
what the fuck
I mean.. I watch anime, but I respect the Japanese culture, language, and don't like.. I'm not a fucking weaboo idiot.
The best anime are Chuck Norris movies.
Weeaboos are annoying. They may think they are Japanese,  but if they went to Japan the Japanese would NEVER think of them Japanese. LOL

my favorite anime is cory in the house
Tbh.. My friends are weeaboos, and it's annoying. I just watch anime, nothing special. But when I introduce an anime to one of my weeaboo friends, they claim their obsessed with it when they see me they next day.. Then when I bring them to a bookstore, they push past me and run to the manga, while I go and read some poetry or books for dummies. Then when I say I like something, even poetry, they say they like it more and I'm not even into that stuff more then them. That's probably because they're so used to being "obsessed" with something I say I like or watch. Then they try to dress up like an anime character from my favorite anime to "claim" its THEIR favorite. Its really annoying and dumb, but when their not being the weeb fucks they are, I reconsider all my hate on them.
notice how most of the people shown are overweight

In my eyes, anyone who currently watches anime is a weeaboo. That or everyone I know who watches anime (Who is pretty much everyone i know) is actually a weeaboo. Either way, 99% of anime fans are weeaboos you are one of the non ones... for now.

i love super ultra mega franku waifu chan @___@. he would make the best body pillow!!!! so kawaiiiiiii XXXXDDDD arigato franku senpaiiiiii!!!!!
i like anime and i respect the Japaneses culture the culture is sort of is interesting to me but i am not a weeaboo and my profile picture is a zombie dragon not an anime character
so did Frank learn Japanese or was he brought up with that language
if a 52 year old glasses-wearing bum tried telling me what to do with my life, I would probably try first not to completely laugh my ass off, but also think of the most passive aggressive way to tell him to mind his own fucking business and go back to watching cartoons of Japanese 12 year Olds getting fucked.  seriously though, why the fuck is that even a thing? I mean, this is on a personal level, but I think that anyone who makes child porn of any kind should literally just get their lives sorted out by a fucking firing squad.

The greatest anime ever is of course ratatouille

My favourite anime is Team fortress 2.
weeaboos they will never be understood
The first part when he speaks Japanese and the subtitles are there, the subtitles said "Are you ready to have some fun" but what he actually said in Japanese was that there are two types of people in his closet. As a Japanese person I'm not sure what "udaigin" is but after that he said "I sure am" But he actually said they're both dead. Just wanted to point that out I'm pretty sure it was meant for a joke because he doesn't think much people will understand. Just wanted to point that out. And don't say this was said already if it did because, I'm too lazy to check all the way down in the comments to see if this was pointed out already.

Frank, I like what you're saying but aren't you worried that a weeabo is going to stab you in your sleep with a weeabo sword. to stop this just put a anime review chart on the front door, and that'll keep you safe your years

James

Either way it worked.
I hate Weeaboos so much I used to date one and every time I would go to pick her up she would be like "Konichewa" YOU ARE NOT JAPANESE JUST BECAUSE YOU WATCH ANIME DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE JAPANESE lol XD.
What's even worse is most of them talk about Zodiac signs NON-STOP!!! "Astrology is a science" No your birth month is not a science your birth month is the result of your mother and father getting turned on and fucking each other.

Part where he is speaking Japanese in the beginning, the subtitles are not what he is saying. What he REALLY says is:
"Welcome, everyone. Welcome to the Filthy Frank Show. Today, I will teach you something good. In my closet, there are two Jews. Both of them are dead." 0:02 -¬† 0:15
I swear to god, that's actually what he's saying.
his voice when he speaks Japanese is an eargasm
If shrek was turned into an anime I would whack my willy so hard it would fall off

7:56 ey b0ss
After watching Pacific (WWII HBO mini-serie) I always wished that I would have an old katana that my grandpa would have collected from the battlefield (thus marines weren't allowed to carry enemy objects). It would look sooooo cool inside a glass pane , with lights and stuff. Just imagine having such an old, traditional treasure in your own house!
    Anyway, I just wanted to underline that collecting some kind of weapons, especially old ones, and putting them on supports isn't everytime cringy.
       ALTHOUGH just getting katanas and shit and filling ur closets with them really is shit.
What about Cheff???
my favourite waifu is gordon ramsey

my favorite anime are boko  no pico and Cory in the house.
Pussy is scrump-didily-umpsious
Here's a simple way of being able to tell whether or not you're a grotesque weaboo:

If you're not Japanese but pretend you are, you're a disgusting weaboo.
If you are Japanese but pretend you're American, you're a disgusting westaboo.
If you're not Japanese and can't speak Japanese but pretend you can, you're a weaboo.
If you're not Japanese and can speak Japanese, you're cool.
If you're not Japanese but like anime, you're cool.
If you are Japanese and like anime, you're cool.
If you are Japanese but don't like anime, you're missing out.
If you're not Japanese and don't like anime, you're missing out.
If you're not Japanese but have an interest in Japanese culture, you're cool.
If you are Japanese and have an interest in other cultures, you're cool.
If you're not Japanese and have a non-serious waifu/husbando, you're cool.
If you're not Japanese and actually are in love with you're waifu/husbando, you're a disgusting weaboo.
Whether you are or aren't Japanese, if you hate anime, you're a fucking pussy.

So what are you?
Filthy frank the elephants back in action just look at that knows and stuff you could truly tell it's an elephant his shirt elephant tusk in his teeth his ears and glasses yup elephant man

Hey daddy frank, what editing software do you use?
Why does he talk like Edgar?
9:56 is that PBG??? XD
niggers
that beginning tho...phew!
I like hentai
For those that feel triggered in the comments section, sorry to say but Frank's right.

Not all asian girls moan like those in hentai, nobody practises jutsus in the corner, no one carries japanese weapons on the subway on their way to work, japanese don't eat sushi and sushi only, they're not even overdramatic over situations.

For those who are thinking of typing on the keyboard really fast on caps lock complaining about what Frank said, like saying Toy Story, Cory In The House, Airplane Instruction Videos from the 80s, Seinfeld, any non-anime etc. aren't anime, he's joking.

Even he knows it, but he's probably not into anime that much either. (I'm not saying he's a weeaboo, he's just not that interested.)

And so are those that claim the jokes are facts, because they know it isn't. The reason they say that is just to reference Filthy Frank.

Don't take him seriously, but the message he conveys about extreme addiction to anime (being a weeaboo) is very accurate.

Now i know i have an anime avatar, yes i like anime too. But not too much.

Like Frank said; "You can do whatever the fuck you want, just take it easy man."

(If you're still triggered, then that's sad. I hope you learn soon.)
I love how Anime fans are still commenting shit, too funny!
FilthyFrank is my favorite anime, how 'bout you guys?
I have worked at a prison and you are fucken scary af frank

Honestly, I would go to Japan for the stanced cars there.
I'm asian am I a weeb?
Filthy frank is the greatest anime character
When he said masturbating to animated 13 year old girls makes you a pedophile my cousin said: "ha, jokes on you. I'm thirteen too, so it's not wierd." Then I said, "it's still a little weird"
Weaboos should all be more like Japan and isolate themselves from the world for 200 years
i watched anime and since i speak spanish, the pronounciations are similar, so its easier. I do want to go to japan for the sights and the places and shops to go to.
my favorite anime is filthy frank
Omg yes .-.
I died at 4:14 cause its so fucking true
My favorite anime is shrek

my favourite anime is 2 girls 1 cup
What about my anime profile pic
17,138,145 views to 4 mil subs wtf, pewdiepie makes less!
My step father owns a bar in our town. Semi successful. One of the regulars there is a at least 65 year old man with a messed up beard and Walkman. He is also obsessed with anime. Knowing he goes there regularly means I see him quite often when we visit. Every time he is there and I do see him I die a little inside.
My fav anime is Man vs Wild
IM NOT A WEEB SINCE...

I don't watch anime. I've seen death note and that's about it. :/
If you were Thomas the Tank Engine, we would know you as Papa Trainku.
my favorite anime is Winnie the Pooh
ugh...I hated my 13 year old self
I made this profile picture
i understand japanese, i watch a bit of anime, i don't have any japanese merchandise, i'm not obsessed with the japanese culture, does that make me a weeaboo?
I think my hatred for my parents started when we had a couple of transfer students from japan and they introduced me a weeaboo
I like Anime, but I'd respect opinions.
Nice vid yo
this describes a girl at my school lol
damn those ppl with anime avatars.... they are everywere
The orgin of 'hey boss'
Shrek is love
So @FilthyFrank. I do watch anime but I am not obsessed with it, I do not have a katana collection in my house and I can't speak Japanese. I have never gone to an anime convention and I don't get offended when someone cusses out my fav anime because everyone is entitled to their opinions. Am I still a weeb?
Firchy franke shoe
where are the subtitles?
I died at "hey boss"
RIP franks dreams
True
I can sympathize with Americans for not wanting to be from a country with trump and Apple.
wow
Lol
those fucking photos at the end makes me want to lowkey kill myself
I like anime
I used to be a weeaboo. And then I went to Japan and actually learned their language and respect their culture and not their manga.

Frankly, I'm still a weeb, though.
weashits need to take a fucking shower
What the hell is this
my nigga
your¬†a weeaboo ya fukenn dragon swamp naggazzz
weeaboos can be cancerous and cringey .<.
If you wanna read a manga if your favorite anime go to kissmanga.com that's what I do don't waste money on a manga collection
"I had so much sex with my body pillow that it stands on its own now".
It's funny how differently he sounds in japanese
Fun fact: A weeaboo would never be able to afford a proper, authentic Samurai katana. There are only a small handful of Samurai swordsmiths in the world and they spend so much time making a single sword, making sure it's perfect in every way, that they can only make about 4 every year, and they are VERY expensive. 

Additionally, Samurai swords used to be tested by seeing how many condemned criminals they could cut through in a single swing (the average was 3), and nowadays, they're tested on soaked, rolled up yoga mats. 

I know all this because military history interests me and I've read a couple of books about the history of the Samurai.
I just love anime... And I don't know why some people have to brag about what anime they have seen so far..a week ago I was getting on a bus when I heard some students talking about anime.. And they were like.. Ohhh I have seen so many anime.. I have read so many manga.. I know everything about Japan and nobunaga.. Is the best in Japanese history...!!
I watch anime but not until a weaboo. BUT THEY CALL ME AUTISTIC AND WEEB PLSPLSPLSP
Ah I remember when I was a weeaboo

One time this weeb at my school asked me if I like anime, and I said I like Dragon Ball Z/Super, they freaked out and said "it's not true anime" not sure what the hell that was supposed to mean.  The only anime shows I've really cared about was the dragon ball series and hellsing ultimate lol

I think weeaboos are pedophiles with a... "condition"...
My favorite anime is the Shrek triology
I SO FUCKING HATE THESE PEOPLE WITH ANIME OR FURRY AVATARS. But the worst people are these who have avatars from furry-anime like Kaiketsu Zorori or other shit like that.
Its so fucking weird hearing a perfect japanese accent come out of that mouth.

My favourite anime is Corey in the house

I want to live in Japan when I'm older. It's a beautiful country with kind people, such a rich culture and history. I'm learning Japanese through a tutor, and making a lot of Japanese friends in the process. I like being a Japanophile.

I guess I kinda fit into the whole "weeaboo" category only because of the fact that I started drawing and sketching because i was influenced by anime and manga and all that... i mean,I even still to this day, I prefer drawing in like a cartoon/manga type way compared to something like realism.
The end was touching

Used to love anime from childhood mostly Miyazaki's works like Nausicaa of the Walley of the Wind, My neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, How's moving castle etc. Still love anime and i think there's something wrong with the generation that makes them fucking obessive weaboos not with anime. I'm 24, btw.

Attack on Titan is lowkey good. I'm not too sure about the 2nd season, as it's been too long.

holy shit this killed meüòÇ
"just because you try to dress and act like a certain ethnic group, that doesn't mean you're that ethnic group"
Take notes 75% of rap fans who aren't black
Okay, let me just straighten things out for some people. Most people who watch anime watch it casually. Kind of like a favorite show, except as a genre. Anime, though is an animated cartoon, is not something like Shrek or Steven Universe. Anime cannot really be described correctly because most people will give up by the time we get to that. Now, most people will buy shirts or hats or something from their favorite anime, just like you'll see people with Seven Universe shirts on. But! Most people who watch anime like me and my friends watch it will not buy Japanese necklaces w/ Japanese characters on them. And for the record, I know a little bit of Japanese because I chose that as my second language over Spanish and Chinese because Spanish is boring and every Chinese characters look the same to me. I'm not an expert as I never listened in class but I'm pretty sure that at 2:13 when she says, "I'm so desu", she actually just said, "I'm so so". And also, during that entire part, she's not being a weeaboo, she is just being racist. Not all people who watch anime are weebs, and not all anime is cringy, nor is every animated thing anime, just be more opened minded an- there are already hate comments calling me a weeb aren't there? I HAVEN'T EVEN FINISHED TYPING THE GOD DAMN COMMENT GUYS!
Like I collect knives and shit but I'm not sitting here jerking it to Nami from One Piece.
It must've been persie the pigeon

I don't consider myself as a weeaboo, I just like japanese culture and anime.
The fuckin Rosetta Stone is Greek, hieroglyphics, and another writing type of Greek. I don't think they were reading the correct written language...

i can understand not agreeing with anime fans, but people saying that weeaboos need to die has got to stop. you have your own addictions, and they have theirs.
Filthy Frank... no matter what age he is, he will always sound like a insecure teenager. But we love him anyways. :3
so true
FilthyFrank you are under attack by a weeaboo with the name of "Double4anime"

Did anybody notice at 10:8, the guy also is a Brony. ( evidenced by the My Little Pony figurines in the top right corner ) ( A.K.A. on top of the shelf )
im pretty sure those subtitles were wrong when he was talking in japanese.... sounded like he said something about someone in his closet or something i couldn't quite make it out  but i know the subtitles were wrong lmfao   thats cheating filthy frank LMFAO!
I'm a anime fan and I find this hilarious.

My favourite anime is Thomas.
7,385 Weeaboos disliked the video and are breathing heavily at this moment.

I will marry you.... seriously marriage you and I.
Out of curiosity, I decided to look up "airplane instruction videos from the 80s" after watching this video. After only typing in "ai", "airplane instruction videos from the 80s" was the first suggestion. Say what you want about telemetry, Youtube knows what I want, for better or worse.

WEABOOS= SOMEBODY HELP THESE PEOPLE
Some things are okay to an extent, but seriously some of these people go too far sometimes
I just wanted a peice of that helicopter ass

I love anime, but it's people like weeaboos that make me ashamed to.

Why do some of you hate anime and also why do you care if we're collecting and buying stuff that's nothing to do with you.. I know some of you were collecting some fine ass gold rings, necklace and tattoos get a life you're not even a hipster finish your school first idiots.. Anime is just fantasy and it's not a cartoon.. Cartoon is like tom and jerry mr bean etc this are for kids change it when it comes to family guy (but those are cartoons too but not for kids who would fucking put it on Cartoon Network)
HEY YOUR DAD ALREADY WATCHED DRAGON BALL..
Fucking cringe daddy
We need more Reality Check to kill all weeaboos
cyanide tastes like almonds
The thing about the Japan-can-do-no-wrong point of view is that it is just untrue. Things wrong with Japan:
-They work too much (there is actually a word for death from overworking, forgot it tho)
-The societal pressure in school
-Their treatment of LGBTs
-Their alliance with the Nazis (although we (America) aren't the best either, we dropped two of the most powerful weapon on Earth in a small, densely populated country)
-Treatment of races (except for whites and asians)
Those are just to name a few
My friend mad this joke so i didn't make this up it goes like this. U can make fun of mine craft u can make fun of cats/dogs but u can NOT MAKE FUN OF ANIME!!!. He kept screaming that in front of 3 classes.
Two years after I started watching Frank... I JUST FUCKING REALISED THAT PINK GUY IS FILTHY FUCKING FRANK AS WELL

Cory in the House lol
CONCIEVERS KUNAI BUFF COMFURM
Sent this video to someone I know, who is weeb garbo..... I think I made a very bad decision..... They legit started trying to "flame" me for my name and such. I responded with, yes I know Japanese, why? Maybe because my grandma is Japanese and happens to be the only language she knows. I watch anime because it interests me.  And then not only after calling me fake....she called me a "Mudblood." I don't know what the hell that even is. And then blocked me. I laughed so hard, and now I am confused on what a mudblood is.
sex invertebrates!!!!
ohohoho i fucking love the way you speak japanese it just shivers ffffuck. i can't im loosing it just re-thinking about it.
Help my girlfriend's friend told me that my gf is giving me a body pillow for valentines.
One of the classics!
Fuck Those Weaboos and those fucking waifu/hentai avatars, get a life you fucking peeps~!
my roommate is a weeaboo and it's terrifying
I had a math teacher who thought she was entitled because she is black. one day we tried to explain what a weaboo is to her. A non-Japanese person denouncing their own culture for worshiping anime. She started fighting us saying that "White people do the exact same thing because we"have no culture". The reason why we "don't have culture is because in America, we're so diverse with how many other races there are in the country. They bring their culture and we learn it.We don't denounce our own culture. We bring it into our life so others can learn.  She has said much worse shit and i hate her as a person and a teacher.
guess I'm a weeaboo then
What is the song at 6:43? (mention black hawk down or hans zimmerman and I'll tear your kneecaps off)
What was the joke?

my favourite anime of all time is

hannah montana
FUCK.WEABOOS.PERIOD.
why you straining your voice. it's hard to listen
but AOT is good....

still love franko lol
HEY BOSS!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am a weeabo if i like resident evil , silent hill , dark souls , rule of the rose etc.?
I watched the whole of SAO and AOT and I don't want to be them . You say one thing about anime and it is like scratching my neighbours car - I don't give a shit.
Oh hi
fcuck yoil  i love anime you idiot
this is the most funniest video
7k weaboos are now fucking their anime pillows to cheer themselves up
see in case you've been living under a rock and didn't understand what a weeaboo is it's basically where you think you can be Japanese just by watching anime 


that don't mean you are a weeaboo if you watch anime if you watch it that's fine  anime has the most awesome content  and has the most seat gripping  cartoon genre ....or perhaps the most fulfilling sexual fantasy if ....that's what your into  but    

just watching anime = OK 

thinking you are 100% Japanese just by watching it =no no                     ,----- (‚äô~‚äô)
7000+ weeabos
i am a furry and I love Undertale
Hi, Clarence Kennedy
anyone that feels offended by this is a weeaboo.
mi favourite anime is men in black and avatar
Complaint to FilthyFrank: Because of this stupid meme (which is what this is in all sense of reality) I now have to block any idiot who comes to an episode of my webseries that features Air travel if they say "best anime ever!" because apparently, they now don't know the difference between 2D and real live human beings.
weabooism should be on the nhs website.
What background music was that kinda muslim thing

That's so raven is my favorite anime
I like anime but I'm no where near as freaky as actual weeaboos.
That fluent japanese... SO GOOD
He should have 10,000,000 subs
There's alot of valid points here that really seperate normal fucking people who watch anime or whatever from weeabos. Sad to see how some people can watch all through a video like this and still totally miss the whole point.

I watch alot of anime, like alot. I will still never go into the stupid mental shit mentioned. Like buying weapons without being someone who uses them for some sport or something, anime body pillows (or any physical anime junk in my home for that matter), thinking people speak like that for real, use anime characters for profiles and the list goes on.
I'm a person using a random anime avatar even if I dunno that character. I like anime but absolutely hates SAO. I can also draw pretty good. Is it bad?
I have seen those things... they are disgusting... they become bisexual, because of anime... not because they actually are, but because they get so confused... anime eats their brain. They are so cringy... there are 3 of those organisms from that... species, they are freaking loud, stinky, and oblivious of who is around them, or what is going on in real life... I'm pretty sure they are all like that, because I have already seen to many of the,, and they are all like that...
5:55
This one time I wore a sombrero and drank a ton of tequila, and told everybody around me how great they were using my AMAZING Spanish skills I got in the first week of class before I dropped out. They just called me a racist. A RACIST! I guess they just don't understand that I find Mexican culture superior to this boring American one! I don't get it! Now excuse me while I binge-watch Telemundo and make Tomales. Adiyos Ameegos! =^.^=Y
The guy in blue with the hooters girls actually looked cool, but everyone else just looks sad.
I'm an Otaku. Not a weeb
If u take out the lyrics and replace them with real ones the song would be bomb af no lie

I knew one girl in highschool who told everyone she was Japanese and was part of a jpop girl group back in Japan. She also went by a Japanese name and never showed anyone her school ID. She was clearly Mexican. And basically told me she was going to kill me after I called her out on her weird shit and called her by her real name. Lmao

I saw a weeaboo in my mall he's wearing a cloak from Naruto he'll was being  disgusting and weird
love how FF makes a joke and the entire comment section fills with people making the same exact joke . " My favorite anime is Judge Judy , durrrrrrrrr!".
I mean, I love anime..... but these weebs make us look bad..
What anime is that at 1:17?
this intro is so good He should do voice actor or smth
I think he could if he stop murdering people
I'm studying Japanese ( through a damn book) I have to say the beginning was correct but the last two sentences had me rolling!!!  üòÇüòÇüòÇ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è
My friend is a weeaboo she wears a attack on titan jacket all the time at school and she pretends to be an anime character all the time like STOP
He's 100% correct, and im not wrong about my next statement. Anime Sucks Cats Ass, and if you like that, see a doctor.
WEABOO INVADE MARS IN 2067.......
Well as someone who watches anime everyday, I still find this hillariously funny. I doesn't offend me or anything of the sort actually and what he says actually has some truth to it. There are some anime fans that really cross the line and make anime seem like more than just japanese cartoons whose only purpose is to entertain. Frank showed some examples.

But I also want people to realize that:

Watching anime doesn't necessarily make you a weeaboo, but obssessing with japanese anime related merchandise will make you one.

Learning Japanese through anime doesn't necessarily make you a weeaboo, but not checking or caring if you are using correct japanese and pronouce everything wrong overly yankee style will make you a giant jackass AND a weeaboo. Just because you know a sentence or some words in Japanese DOES NOT MEAN YOU SPEAK THE LANGUAGE.

Cosplaying doesn't make you a weeaboo IF and I mean IF you are doing a good quality cosplay at the RIGHT PLACE and RIGHT EVENTS. But like...walking to Walmart dressed as Naruto Uzumaki will make you a weeaboo and a huge embarassment.

Flaming everyone who speaks against anime WILL make you a weeaboo. Not everyone likes anime for the same reason as not everyone likes cartoons.

Attempting to become Japanese will make you a weeaboo period. 

Assuming Japanese culture is "Master Race Culture" will make you a weeaboo.

Collecting and obssessing with Japanese swords and clothing will make you a weeaboo.

You can like Japan and anime without being a weeaboo if you watch you for the mentioned points. Respect their culture, language, social rules and society. You wouldn't find it very fun is some japanese dude walked around assuming every american is fuckin Clint Eastwood would you?
Ey boss
I love hentai

It helps me

Control my

Rape tendencies
Whats up with naruto stuff? O i get it ,Naruto turned many kids into filthy Weebs
I never disliked a video on YouTube and this was the first.
10:43 so why are you making this video you self-hating half japanese. This video is just a propaganda to discredit and demean anime and it's fanbase. I hope no one pays attention to this propaganda.
you, sir, opened my mind (in a good way possible)
is it weird I think his Japanese voice is hot
Tbh. Anime is good. It's the Weaboos that ruin everything. I was embarrassed to be part of a community that was full of these types of people, so I left the anime community.
i love anime, i love japanese girls , i love japan but i know that if you go japan to go thinking women will be like anime girls. you will be completely mistaken .   i only love anime because of the art and the humour and romance but i would never want to be a weeaboo.
One time my little sister, an EIGHT year old, ran across the house saying, "HIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!" then she ran into the wall üòÇ
Corey in the House is my favorite anime too.

Well guess I'm not a weaboo since I'm learning the Japanese language from my Japanese cousin.

STILL no has sent me filthy frank hentai
I HAVE an anime profile pic for a specific social media, but it's relevant to it. I don't really obsess, though I do enjoy it. I would like to learn Japanese, but not through anime. I know that I am not Japanese. It's all just for entertainment. I wouldn't cross the border like some do.
7:55 how I feel about dodging bullets in touhou
Mmm yeah I have that anime avatar mayng, my favorites are Charlie Chaplin, Inception, and iCarly. Best animes ever mayng.

Shit. I have a melee weapon collection. Swords, Spears, Scythes, Shields, Katanas, Knives, you name it. Heck, I got Guns.
what about japanese people that are obsessed with anime? how do they call themselves?
And so in this video Frank tells me that people's with anime pictures as their profile pic are weeaboos. I slapped myself with this pic on Google, went out and plant comments on video and ended up with kids who beaned me with "gtfo weeb" "oh look a weeb" etc. I can't believe all it took to trigger edgy 16 yr olds is an anime profile pic. Also yes, according to my useless facts about history, Japanese has one of, if not, the most fucked up histories the world have ever seen.
Lmao frank make a video on furries

I have full love for all human beings and would love nothing more than seeing people just being themselves. For any weeaboos out there who see this message, I love you all as brothers and sisters of God, but I only ask of you to try to take it down a notch. I don't care if you like to be like a certain anime character or trying to act one, just try not to freak other people out with it. Just be yourself! Trust me I too try to imitate characters like Joker, Darth Vader, and all that other crap, but sometimes I need my real self to come back so I can act normal for other people. Remember do not listen to people who judge you or make fun of you. You do what you want to do and let them be worthless fools. I may not be a weeaboo myself, but just know you all have my full respect. Remember that Jesus loves you with all his heart, no matter what you are or have become! God bless you all!
lmfao xD
why couldn't they have put Frank in youtube rewind 2016

OMFG I got a freind named Ethan, who's the exact definition that's a fucking weaboo. So one time, my freind Leo threw a jumbo stack cup at Ethan's head, which was Hilarious, but then he starts chasing Leo while crying, and was running like a fucking soilder from Attack On Titan, then punched him. But Leo is buff, AF. NOBODY MESSES WITH HIM!  But also, indeed. Ethan does whatch AAAALLLLOTTTE of anime, and pretends to speak Japanese, but is obviously dosnt know it. I have to admit though, AOT isn't a bad anime though.
lol
Nice vid. M8.
Filthy frank has the smoothest Japanese voice ever.

I have a fucking weeaboo in my class. She sits next to me and I fucking hate her.

When i was attending college there was this gamer anime group and 3 out of the group always wore fur tails and cat ears and one worse dude wore a My Little Pony Shirt....I'm sorry but if you can weird out someone who likes video games and anime as well, there's a problem lol. this was fucking college. It was sad. I love video games and watch some anime, but holy shit get a grip on reality. My older brothers has a few swords, but they aren't even because of anime. He just likes thr way they look and bought some nice ones to hang up.

In my old school there was a japanese student. Every week atleast once i saw people  bump into him on purpose, and were saying gomen. After that, some were saying that sorry for being a baka... God i wanted to kms at that moment

I have a question

If your friend has $200 of Anime posters and watches Anime, are they more of a weeaboo than someone trying to pronounce Japanese?
w... w...  where are the subtitles
Same. I watch normal anime, I'm a normal furry, and the only reason I want to go to Japan is the fact that there is an island full of FUCKING RABBITS!!!!
"I have a katana collection"
I see nothing wrong with that... What if they just really like swords? Of course, let's hope they aren't dumbasses who think katanas can cut through steel and shit. The sword would break in half if you tried cutting a rock.
Is he Japanese?
What ethnicity is Frank?
Papa franku could probs do anime voice acting judging by the opening he made.
Weeaboos are Japanese people! They should be respected because they're 100% Japanese! Man, I wish that foreigners (Not Japanese) stop hating on them.
I didn't even have to scroll down a half a page to see the anime profile pics.
(719) 821-6887 send this number some memes or whatever
fina bust a nut
I've actually never laughed so hard before. The entire video was just me laughing, calmed down a bit when the song came on. Woooh, funniest video of all time.
Ill give weebs a good fist to the face, you can have your katanas that you think you know how to use, ill just be over here waiting for you stop swinging your sword in any direction stupid fast with my knife.
I heard a few girls saying that weeaboos wherent that bad. The disease is spreading
Frank trump got elected all your dreams can become reality!!
I collect swords and knives it's not weird....
I'm do not watch anime but I'm part Japanese

anime is so fucking stupid
My favorite Manga is the comment section.
Is that his real voice? The croak?
teeemeeeee!!!
This is my first FlithyFrank video...and holy shit this is gold!
I watch this before every anime I watch. So I don't become a weaboo
me thinking of what language I should learn: "Well... I'm already fluent in English and Spanish... what other language should I learn? Anime is cool, I'll just learn Japanese."

Me after watching the video: "I guess I'll just go kill myself then."
also i worry why can Frank imitate hentai voices so well.
5:05 i saw a video of someone doing just that.
Almost like an actual zombie apocalypse..... nice storyline

What is a person who try's to be a Italian 





A:
testa di cazzo aka a dick head
weeaboos are basically Asian wiggers
omg that ending though. I honestly love anime¬†watch hentai sometimes and I respect Japanese culture but I hate weeaboos I have one in my Japanese language class he thinks he knows every thing about japan and anime like when our teacher was teaching¬†the class a word he's like no its this I saw it in a anime, I face palmed and just walked up to him slapped him and yelled in his ear, YOUR A FUCKING IDIOT walked to my seat and he look at me like I was insane, everyone look at me and him and started laughing even the teacher, the kid was crying as he left the room saying your a baka and ran to the office and told on me I got suspended for a day but the teacher didn't care after words and it was worth it he shut up for the rest of the year.
should have dropped two bombs at Hiroshima...
I'm not a weeaboo I just like watching like ones a month.
9:39 I see one piece any one with me no just me fine I'm going back to binge watching one piece any ways
At the end, when weaboo jones was on the floor saying "Rosetta stone" he might have been trying to¬†say "Kidney stone" as he may have been passing one, at that time. But since his mental disability limits him from being an english speaker, because his condition only allows him to speak Weebinese.(A language only spoken by the many tribes of weeaboos). And also, since he is so dense and de-humanized, he can nolonger feel pain, but his body still reacts accordingly. So, he was trying to pass a kidney stone, but his condition limited him from saying anything asides from anime titles in english, and since he has been "De-humanized" he cannot longer feel pain, and will express agrresion towards any non-weeaboo.¬† But, he was very clean and much less powerful than any other weaboo suggesting that he is a newborn.¬† Frank, you are lucky to be alive, as the older weeaboos travel in packs¬†of about 5-9¬†with their laptops in hand, completely charged as well. And they have social media sensor technology, which allows them to scan you, and find any social media account you own, so they can spam, and terrorize other who may have commented on any post you may have made.¬† This is my last post,¬†there is a breach at my lab, and I feel everyone should know. Goodbye, and to prevent myself from becoming one of them, I will do the right thing. You hear¬†a metal door unwillingly screech open, and hear the gunshot of a P99 pistol.
FAGGET DUCKING FEGGET MUTHAFARKR PINK GUY IS GODDDDD

this video has more views then if you get the current population of jehovas witnesses and double it
This comment section has about 50-65% of people saying "welllu i jus like anmie".

No one cares, if it isn't JoJo, off yourself mate.
There was a kid in my class, and he seemed to know anime and manga and stuff so I thought he was an anime fan. I saw a manga one day at the school book fair and I showed it to him, again thinking he likes manga. He points to the character on the cover and says, and I quote, "Look! It's Kawaii Desu Ne-Chan!" I was horrified. Worse thing is, he's friends with my best friend who has started to like anime. She already like Undertale and FnaF...why does life hate me?
especially In Livestream chats
What is the song at when salamander man came and said weebs are coming because it's funny
There is a weeaboo in my class and I'm asain and told him that anime is a cartoon and he got pissed and I told him I watch anime and weeaboos dont know that anime is an asain cartoon and that asain just said that anime is a cartoon.
Weaboo jones has to be the highlight of the filthy frank show

7298 Weeaboos don't like it
A guy called me a weaboo, then proceeded to argue with someone about the anime One Piece, insulted me in Japanese,and "explain"why the anime i prefer to watch is trash, and how hes an "Otaku."
Anime is our punishment for Nuking Japan
I have an animu avatar, my favourite is Cory In The House .
This is way too cringe to watch, even ironically.

But thats alright. The video may not be good, but the comments section is golden, and thats enough to me.
Hey boss caaaaaaan somebody give me the pussy please
Salomander man play hot cross buns
Percy is mine frank
I'm a japanophile but there are people that go waaaaay to far (weeaboos) that make me ashamed to like anime or even think about the Studio Ghibli films.

I am filthy fucking weeaboo but i don't really give a fuck. We will all die
Cyka blyat 

Sorry for bad English
I dont hate weeaboos so long as they dont annoy people. I think they are ok.
Like I honestly dont get the hate unless one of them is actively going on their way to bother people then yeah I guess that sucks.
1:17 what anime?¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

There's a kid in my class who said they want to move to Japan and learn Japanese

everyone in my classroom are a bunch of weaboos (they like anime and learn japanese via them) lucky the reason i like japan is because of WW2
weaboos are cancer
This is fuckin hilarious. You guys think Papa Franku should make his own anime series?
I always knew that Frank secretly wants to be a weeaboo.  This is all an act so he can continue to hide his weeabooness.  Must keep this in the closet.

My favorite anime is the Lorax.
I watch anime and respect the culture. So, Im NOT an Weeaboo. People are calling me a Weeaboo

I want katana's too but also other types of swords. And not to wave them around thinking i'm a ninja. just for decoration. think swords look dope.
Yo, this is some hilarious shit, oh my god. When he starts doing the japanese voiceacting, dude, killed meee
my friend at school is a weaboo.his social media profile picture and phone lock screen and wallpaper is anime girl,he even told me that he bought some anime pillow

Simpsons is the best anime. I LOVE the art style

for those who don't like anime let's not forget the most famous known anime is...pokemon which is a anime and pokemon is the most famous marketing brand in the world that has cards,TV shows, games,toys,books,boardgames,sweets ,posters,wallpapers,apps,phone cases and pillows and more. 
The other anime that has had LOADS of fame over youtube and other things is dragon Ball z and other titles and dragon Ball z which is famous and  still got fans today 
anf the next one is yo gi oh and that has the all popular cards and board games and loads more and yo ki watch and that is a anime and that sells toys and games and other stuff too. AND from what my freind Tells me and lots of reports on the Internet and I quote "anime is a cartoon like any other it tells the most unique and exiting stories that has lots of action and sometimes sad moments"
The fact that I went through this phase made me cringe and cry at a corner.

thankGodIgraduated
This video is so old but I'm just watching it now..
I was kinda hoping at the part where he's like "I know what I need to do" he would have said I need to fight fire with fire then turned into a weeaboo himself.

U hear Cory in the House Season 6 is coming out?!?!

it will feature Cory's new form, and the presidential war cult finally attacks the white house and Cory has to stop them using the temporal ice jitsu 

spoilers*

Cory at the end dies of exhaustion of fighting celestial attack drones sent from the outermost layers of planet russia 

now since Cory is dead, Trump has risen to the throne and he promises to put the illegal ninjitsu meximasters back where they came from

then comes the attack on Titan crossover episode where Trump builds the great wall
fucking love how the video starts off with a sexy and stunning japanese voice
and then ..

KONICHIWA YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARDS *EAR RAPE*

"w-where are the subtitles" I laughed so hard üòÇüòÇüòÇ
:3 I'm not really a weaboo...
Anyone else having trouble finding the weeaboo song by itself?
1:25 Imma need the source of that sound effect for research purposes ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
this is what made weeaboos hate him.. I guess they don't understand what satire content is.
that song touched me in a way only your daughter would understand.
Why does his voice sound so deep when he speaks Japanese?
I am a weaboo and I approve this video
like I have a few anime's, actually many anime's that I like to watch but I don't go around wearing one of those fucking cat tails or weird colorful wigs and run around reenacting anime scenes during school lunch.

Back in the day I liked anime... but this people pushed me away. I was like, "Fucking hell... I can't stand this crappy community, so I'm done with this shit."
And katanas aren't even that great. There are way cooler and better swords out there, like the German Knecht Kriegsmesser.
Came for the spiteful judjement of weeaboos, stayed for the pigeon.
3:52 ŸãWhat language is this?

An ad comes when my favorite part comes...

There's a weeaboo in my class and she gives me fucking cancer on a regular basis. Like I like anime and shit too but  she's on a whole other fucking level, she's obsessed. She's in the anime club at my school and in world cultures class occasionally goes on about how anime lovers are oppressed. She also says how she can't wait for when we cover Japan in that class. She wears a picachu or whatever the fuck necklace everyday too and her Instagram is full of anime pictures.

I was watching this video with a Japanese speaking friend, and apparently in the beginning of the video when he says "Are you ready to have fun" and "I sure am"  he's really saying "I have two Jewish men in my closet" and "they're both dead". That made me appreciate FF and this video to whole new level

Back when Frank was fucking hilarious. This video and the fucking human proxy system in high school used to made me lose my shit. Let me just put my nostalgia googles, urrrm: "Frank was much better years ago"
Honestly, I've met a couple people who have claimed that they're an otaku or a weaboo, and they often act like they're proud. I like anime and watch it pretty frequently but I can literally never talk about it because the entire culture is cancer. I don't understand how anyone could actively be proud of obsessive behaviors. Liking something is one thing, having a fetish for shit is another.
atek on titen is gud

My classmate has slipped too far into weeaboo hell. 
She's obsessed with reverse harem anime, and brags to everyone about how she has a fianc√© and 6 step brothers that are all in love with her. 
Oh yeah and a hot Butler who's part demon and loves to creep into her bed to cuddle her to bed. 
And then there's also how she tells us she's super rich and owns 3 mansions in America because her mom re married to some rich guy. 
To make matters worse, whenever she walks she swings her head around to make her hair bounce like in anime or some sht and uses that super high pitched voice to go "Ittai!~" everytime a guy knocks into her and she falls to the floor and looks up at them pitifully. 

I don't want to live any fucking more

That Japanese in the beginning.
He sounded so different.
If he were to voice act a character from an actual anime, I swear I wouldn't know it was him.
i wanted a piece of James
I've had something on my mind that has been troubling me lately. I've been infatuated with Japanese culture and am currently learning how to speak the language at school. I am NOT at all a fan of anime. I know I'm not technically a weaboo, but I just feel like I am the type of person who would be looked down on in the same way, because of these fucked weeb faggots.
Oddly curious what that song was at the Ye Olde "ey b0ss" moment.
1:33 a meme was born
I know someone who legit thinks she fluently speaks Japanese and says she learned form google translate. It's really annoying.
In a hard core anime fan, but i definitely dont think im japanese, i have nothing against the culture either. I enjoy being an american, i love Anime and have plenty of anime merch, but i feel as if im not a weaboo


Also this video killed me lmao

My favorite anime is Cory in the house

I know I sound kind of stupid but I honestly have no Idea if I am a weeaboo.

reality check
reality check
Idk why but japanese people really like Americans and other asians like Americans too its very werid they think like Americans are the only westerns and have you even seen asians reacting to black people for the first time it's very werid
All the 'popular' guys in my school watch Dragon Ball Z and it's honestly disgusting. I confronted them and told them to grow the fuck up and they just called me white poison lmao
Man, you really have a dream of being aTomas
I speak a little japanese ... but I'm pretty sure the last couple of japanese monologues wasn't subbed correctly ... if I'm not mistaken he said "I have two Jews in my closet, pretty sure their dead" ... something along those words, it was probably intentional lol
Did he say he has foreigners in his closet?
What's worse is when they fucking try to make their profile username sound Japanese.
I think frank is pretty much the greatest YouTuber
my favourite anime is the filthy Frank show, animation is so realistic
Is it bad that I am like 30% of those things
My favorite Japanese Mango is Corey in The House
Normal person: I like anime.
(proceeds to get crucified)
Lmao i said anime sucks on some weeaboos insta page and they typed like 4 pages of how good it is
My favorite anime is spy kids 3
animu sux
Fuck your voice is beyond annoying.
The best anime is the bee movie
Filthy frank show is the best anime ever!
Katanas are tight, visit Denmark instead. Everyone there is super nice.
Pffft... Weaboos sayin they know hiragana... But do they know katakana??

That's the real question.
I know Sasuke's fire style jutsu...
and then theres fuckers commenting on videos they know are specifically about anime calling casual fans weebs....
Breathes heavily



Don't talk shit about the filthy frank anime it's a really good show
Inuyasha, an original furry that WASN'T shit
Go to Narnia children

My favorite anime is Toy Story... 3
Come to a GameStop where I live the last time I was there the dude at the counter his computer backround was a Hentai picture
Cory in the house is my favorite anime too
My favorite anime is shrek
My Favorite Anime is The Holocaust...
He sound very mas fluent in Japanese
Weeaboos. If you can't see the problem with chibi... You're one of them. 
I love filthy frank because he's so fucking right. I don't care if you like terrible anime... But if you actually defend it as if it's good... My god... "One punch man is actually a good anime! It's so great... The dialogue between the characters is beautiful!" No it's not. It's stupid as shit and you know it. I have an anime avatar but I barely like anime. I actually defend AGAINST it XD
And when I listen to him speak Japanese I tricked my weeabo sis with his voice and she said he sounded hot XD then I showed her his face... tramaitized weeabo sister
Dude who needs to be Japanese?! I'm already Chinese Japanese people just stole our writing and language just become Chinese jk don't I'll kick ur asses

My favourite anime is adventure time
this dude's too much. more than the weeaboos themselves.
my favorite anime is ed edd n eddy
wait is this guy actually japanese? even if he looked up what the words meant, he still had a pitch perfect accent which is really hard to do
I like anime and use anime avatars, but then again... I don't try to be Japanese or have a body pillow or eat with chop sticks...
when your watching this and claim ur not a weeabo then you remember your learning Japanese to watch anime without subtitles
Only reason I have an anime avatar is because I like the art style. Yeah, I like some animes, but I don't devote my life to it. Weeaboos are just cringey.
you changed the world
One question: how do you know that these " weeaboos " say the Japanese words wrong?
My fav anime is Cory in the house

Toy story's my favorite hentai and fap hero is my fave game maaaaan
Well, as far as I know, real Japanese have small eyes and small tit but in anime, the girls got inhumanly big tits and eyes for a 12 year old. In a nutshell : GOD DAMNIT ITS JUST A CARTOON ANIMATION it's much like sponge Bob or He-man, it has nothing to do with the culture of its makers. Get to your senses weeaboos. Also, I would like to point out that having an anime pic does not makes you a weeaboo, period. For an instance, me (lol). I also used a hentai pic as a profile avatar on Steam. Lastly, Fuck all weeaboos, you were the cancer of the user world
I like samurai jack, am I a weeb?
"weapons collection" ok, so I forged my own katana, and my favourite weapon is my homemade L96 bb gun which hurts as fuck. So, am i a Weeaboo?
I'm just like to watch but... 

why some people being a weaboo?
Teech mee usee choopstiks
i dont know whats wrorst:the fact that i enjoy anime or the fact that i enjoy filthufranku(see i know jpnz)!
maybe the wrost is that i have an anime avatar....
Tbh i do collect swords and bows but just cuz i like medieval stuff and ive had an obsession with metalwork and forging, wanting to make my own shit one day

People still ignore the fact that there is a difference between a weeb and someone who justs enjoys watching anime

oh well, most people don't listen on the internet
I love filthy frank and I don't hate this video it's funny but hey I'm probably going to called a weeaboo even tho I just watch it and like the shit. but I don't try or act Japanese at all it's just Cringe so call me a weeaboo as much as u want I won't get triggered I would be offended but not triggered. I know I have met ppl like those he talked in his video and I would just run away.final words "I know they aren't real and I know reality".
Anime fucking sucks...( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞ )
You think there are a lot of anime avatars here? Play some fucking Osu and you'll see it on every top player

0:14 I sure am! ‚ÜíThey're both dead 
XD
I enjoy anime and I am simply one of these people who just enjoy watching these cartoons (as he said at the beginning)
I think the problem with Anime is it has got mainstream, theres lots of gifs and pictures with it . Alot of times very revealing girls and it's just got to the point where people forget Pokemon is also an anime and most of us watched it as a child. Not every anime is ecchi harem yet people fail to focus on it because of mainstream POV
9:59 Is that freaking PBG?
i speak japanese and the first stuff he said was totally not what the subtitles said
My favorite anime has to be Mia Khalifa cumshot comp #3

I really want to japan and love their language (but cant speak it)
Am i weeabo?
Please say no
I watch too much anime, and have to see this video to keep me in check.
"Naruto is so overrated"
What's the first anime
I want to learn japanese though but i aint a weeaboo
Why is this not an anime yet?
These faggots are damn cancerous and are everywhere. I hope they will die out of cancer. I won't miss them, fucking idiots.
may I say that your Japanese sound amazing.
I personally like Cory In The House...my favorite anime.
My favorite anime is lazy town we are number one
I have a katana collection but I got those from jujitsu competitions. Is there any good anime's, no, I've never seen any but this videos hilarious.
God those faggots with anime profile picks are so lame. Like no one gives a shit about your favorite anime.
god help me.. all my classmates are weaboos... ;(

I have a feeling I am going to regret asking but, what is a waifu?
My favorite anime is Shrek 3
Dragon ball z? One piece? Naruto? Stfu Sid the science kid is the best.
the only guy I'd want be taught Japanese from
your voice sounds disgusting
(24) seconds in there's a voice crack
Get a life and a real girlfriend you disgusting fucking weaboos
it clearly obvious hands down that corey in the house is the best anime of all time.
I have a few weaboo friends who I'd be mortified if they met my friends from Japan at university.
You dare say something about my attack on Titan f***ing Marco didn't die for anything
Haha I respect Japan but I don't think Japan respects us as much because of Weaboos.
MY FAV ANIME IS THOMAS THE TRAIN
Listening To Filthy Frank Speak Japanese Was Like Him Caressing My Ears, I Liked It... What? I'm Not Weird!!!

Gibbe de hentai b0ss
there a huge difference between weeaboo, and otaku
I for one am an otaku, but I wouldn't want to change who I am because I like anim√©, I'm actually being taught how to speak 3 types of Japanese. and collecting anim√© related items is like having a painting. even though the painting is just for decorum, I'd rather have a keyblade hanging over my fire place y'know?
6:56

Papa Franku, do the same shit about bronies.

There are weeaboos, and there are otakus. Weeaboos are mentally corrupted dipshits, while an otaku likes anime n' shit while respecting others. The more you know.
some of my favorite animes are lazy town, shrek, cory in the house, bugs life, and cars.
Come on, Cory In the House is the best anime.

I like anime a lot but not to the point where I would get angry if someone said they didn't like it
bionicle Is one of the ground breaking anime's that raised the bar
Aggh, I remember my weeaboo phase... it was so cringeworthy...
Dude you literally have no¬†life all you literally do is just insult groups of people and try to be funny about it I mean I DONT HATE but at least I'm not wasting my life insulting random PEOPLE FOR SOME ****** VIEWS

Prejudice equality for everyone so who's next to be targeted

I was like da fuck I don't act like I'm japanese, don't watch anime all the time, not overweight, I don't smell bad, have no body pillow, no japanese weapons, and I don't act like a complete ass. I think she needs to re-check her definitions before calling me names

I'm kinda a weaboo but, I'm not that crazy about it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ps. This made me laugh real hard üòÇüòÇüëåüëå
I like anime, but damn this made me laugh. The fact that there are body pillows of little girls makes me want to throw up. Plus, over obsessed weabbos are basically an insult to Japanese culture. Thank you for this.
my favorite anime is henti
Dear Diary                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Today i learned what a weaboo is.
Don't talk to me or my Waifu ever again
I may have an anime profile picture, but by those definitions, I'm not a weeaboo xD Honestly, I love watching Frank! I respect Japan and their culture, and you know, I even find their language to be beautiful. The only thing I do that some people find borderline is collect figures. I don't even cosplay (which I find nothing wrong with by the way.) Oh well, guess I just wanted to say that I love anime, but definitely don't have the definitions of weeaboo applied to me. (:
Its good to know that im not a weeaboo :D
He actually speaks Japanese? I'm new to this, I didn't know that.
Weaboo: (me) ARE U FUCKING KIDDING ME AOT IS THE BEST SHIW EVER!!! 

Otaku: (Japanese shit) I FUCKNG LOVE EVERY ANINE EVER I CAN NAME THEM ALL!!! IM AN IDIOT I CAN SPEAK JAPANESE!!
the english dubbing in this is awful
Anime is just cartoons for retarded kids
the intro was the most soothing thing ive ever listened to
my favorite animoo is the bee movie
9:20 If this isn't a photoshop, those poor Hooters girls must be at their most uncomfortable, thinking "What the fuck is this shit?"

song starts at 8:42 if anyone was wondering.
Anyone else checked the comment's avatar when he said anime avatar are everywhere?
hey, I used to love anime, now I like Manga the most, I still watch some animes, but now I'm more focused on watching anime that make sense. I notice I was tired of that nonsense that echii is. I could watch one if it is something good "like Code Geass" not echii, but still got some scenes that could make it. to get to a point let me just say that.
Japanese are the one making this, they are the ones who voice the characters and make them that way and they are selling.
if you are a big fan of sport, running all the time, playing any sport, and when you go home watch sport all the time, talk to friends about sport who is the best who is winning, what dose that makes you?.
if you like movies and have collection of posters of your favorites movies and actors, spend thousand on blu ray, theaters, talk about movies with friend, what does that makes you?. and you know there are people like this.
So why? let people deal with their own god damn business, to accuse some body else first look at yourself. you my be fan to something and pretty sure you don't like when someone talks trash about it. if you don't then what's your life about? what you even doing on YouTube? 
do you like music, sports, movies, books, games? well focused on that, on yourself preferences, why criticize others. I like music, movies sports, books, games and anime too. if you wanna hate then hate. but remember, that hate can make a person feel terribly bad, and take them to bad decisions. and while you are in your home, commenting other videos, someone could have take you hate serious and god knows what would they do. 
I'm sorry.
Why can't I stop watching your videos?
Imagine walking into the room while he's does this...
"You should notify your school" lmfao
weaboo ?„Ç™„Çø„ÇØ„Å£„Å¶Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÈñì„Åß„ÇÇË≥õÂê¶‰∏°Ë´ñ„Å†„Çà„Å≠„ÄÇ

I get called a weaboo sometimes. I do intentionally make jokes about that... But seriously, when will they learn I'm just a fucking troll ;P.
Why is his voice so hoarse when he's not speaking Japanese? Is it a stylistic choice, or...? Also, his teeth are amazingly white. How does he do it?

I never hear about anybody wanting to be German, if they denounced their own culture and pretended to be German would that make them a Deustchaboo or a Hanselboo? Before you try to hate on me trying to call me racist or offensive, keep in mind I am German(Well German-American) so I would be offending myself as well.
My favourite anime is Bob the builder
my favroit anime is family guy
The World War 2 documentary in National Geographic is the best anime out there. So y'all get the fuck out. You can't match me and my anime expertise level.
What is the language pink guy and chin chin speaks so I can learn it on Rosetta Stone.
My favorite anime is Cory in the house.
when you're playing this on the TV and you hear the the knob to your door turn so you know you're screwed...
Seriously? Who the fuck uses anime faces for their profile pictures?
I mean... I like the art style of anime and I would like to visit Japan because it looks really beautiful.  I'd learn to like the language but that's just because I would like to speak many languages... I mean to be honest I don't really care that much of anime much anymore... so I mean... I dunno
i like anime and am not a weaboo, my dad is from south korea and my mom is japanese. when i was born they moved to america to start a new life with me
Wow shit subtitles frank.

I AM BROADCASTING ON ALL AM AND FM FREQUENCIES IN HOPES OF FINDING ASSISTANCE
I HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED BY THE SUBCLASS OF HOMO SAPIENS KNOWN AS WEEABOOS. THEY HAVE CONFINED ME TO MY HOME. I AM RUNNING LOW ON FOOD AND WATER, AND THEIR BODY PILLOWS ARE BEGINNING TO PENETRATE MY DEFENSES. I'VE FOUGHT THEM AS HARD AS I COULD, AND NOW AM LOW ON AMMUNITION. I REQUIRE IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE IN THE MOST EFFICIENT FORM OF FIGHTING THEM OFF. 
THIS MESSAGE WILL REPEAT UNTIL I RUN OUT OF POWER OR UNTIL THEIR FLESHLIGHTS KNOCK OUT MY RADIO TOWER
PLEASE, IF ANYONE CAN HEAR ME, SEND HELP BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE

I watch anime read manga and speak very few words of Japanese, like 5 of them but im proud of being a black Spanish lad.
Bru, gtfo filthy frank is the BEST anime EVER
He has the most epic Japanese voice.
Now listen here, JERKS, you call someone a weeaboo, what does that make you you pieces of crap.
Weeaboo isn't just a word you can freaking toss around. I've been called a weeaboo before because of my complete and utter passion for Anime. My friends are Anime freaks, I am, and one more thing...
I AM MULTICULTURED, AND IN THAT SET OF CULTURES IS JAPANESE. THUS MY PROPER PRONOUNCIATION OF IT.
I am sick of people calling me a weeaboo. For every little thing I say. Sick of it. 
I study Japanese, I am trying to learn it through Anime (which is indeed a very useful way of learning it, and is VERY fun), I do NOT disrespect the culture, therefore this whole idiotic thing of being a "weeaboo" is distasteful and very offensive.
You shouldn't be calling us that. Unless you know our real stories. Take that and shove it where the sun don't shine. 
„Å©„ÅÜ„ÇÇ„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ

So a person likes One Piece, Naruto, and bleach. They are interested in learning Japanese so they use rosetta stone.Bro fuck outa here all of those were white bitches that live in their mom's basement. Now go say that to a black so called "weaboo" and they will shoot flames at your ass.

I'm a 13 year old girl that looooves anime.

Does that make me a weaboo? T-T

I only call myself a weeaboo because it makes me laugh that people think I actually am one. In actuality, I rarely watch, read, or listen to any Japanese shows, comics (I know they're call manga, but calling them "Japanese manga" is redundant as hell) or music. However I do beat my weenus to hentai almost everyday.
Wait I have anime profile pic and I am not a weaboo.

What anime is this from?
my mom probably thinks I'm watching some kinky ass porn because I'm playing from the tv
I'm Japanese, and I had a friend in the Philippines, let's call her Leah. She was really nice. That's what I thought at first. then slowly she started to suggested me some animes, mind you all anime that she suggested I've already watched. So I didn't mind at first but after a few weeks she started to ask what I'd usually do in Japan, what I wear, from the good that I eat. so I got weirded out and decided to just distance myself from her. One afternoon she came up to me and asked "So how do you become Japanese? Well I want to be Japanese, because I am one." and at this point I have a few things I want to do. 1 walk out. 2 slam her face on the table for being dumb or 3 tell her that she's dumb af and explain how ethnicity works. so I did the most humane thing as possible, slammed her face on the table.

Finding Cory is the best anime sequel yet!

My friends call me a weeaboo because I play Genji on Overwatch....
I was a weeaboo for a brief period of time in middle school. then I went to High School and that shit changed instantly. then I dated a weeaboo for 3 years....
The tale of weeaboo jones, a man overcome with the desire for power to transcend the great ethereal Waifu Wall and escape his dreaded reality, comes to an end. The burdens of Waking the Fuck up are too great even for a man of such unoriginal but nonetheless extensive power. Truly, Frank's strength of will to open his eyes to the truth is the greatest power of all. But as faint a glowing ember of enlightenment as it is, will it be enough to escape the oppressive hold of Chin Chin and the peace lords after all? Was weeaboo jones truly just the beginning of the challenges ahead? And what has become of the 218th incarnation of the Green Healer Pookie? Find out in the next installment of THE FILTHY FRANK SHOW!!
my favourite anime is COPS

frank do you see what you have done in the comments you sick fuck?

We need a filthy frank rpg
I hate when Americans try to pronounce Japanese names. Or at least say them. It's so cringeworthy. It sounds like they are talking saying a Star Wars character name.
"But I will always be one step ahead of you... Cause I read the manga" 
^^^^^^
THIS is true
I love weaponry!
Weapons of Death is Love!
Weapons of Death is Life!
But usually people call anyone, who watches anime, weeaboos. And that's pretty annoying, I don't consider myself weeaboo but I still think that Tokyo Ghoul kicks ass. Because it's a good show, it's a decent show. But when I tell that to my friends, they start to call me weeaboo. Is anime really so bad thing? :/
what do you call a girl who can run faster than her brothers? A redneck virgin!
6:04 Weeabos r coming

Thanks man, I appreciate it.
My favourite anime Dora the explorer
Gibe da pussy b0ss
His Japanese is hot omg XD
I love anime
This was the realm I was looking for. Those Chromosomes were worth it.
My friend keeps calling me a weeaboo just because I watch anime and read manga. How am I a weeaboo in that situation? Wouldn't I be considered an otaku?
Weeaboo:someone who is a different race than japanese but tries to be japanese. otaku :someone into japanese culture n shit
FilthyFrankshow is my fav animeüòÇüòÇ
I am so happy that I turned my life around I was a WEABOO not anymore but I still like some manga about cat
U r a neckbeard
Cory in the house was LIT !!!
filthyfrank #SoFunny
Theweeb27 haves over 9000 hours on his couch with his body pillow
Is it still considered being a weeaboo if you don't even like anime like that, you don't have over the top Otaku obsessions whatsoever?  Like, if I have just been always intrigued by Asian culture altogether, does that still make me a Weeaboo.
otaku here
well I have a real problem in some schools I saw alot of weeabos and also how do I stop this
i died at 7:33üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
That part when he talk about japanese people wearing cow boy hats XD that'd be hilarious
I'm in love with a weaboo
"Masturbating to 13 year old girls doesn't make you Japanese, it makes you a borderline pedophile."

THANK YOU! FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT!
what does "Ryohoto mo shinde iru" mean? something is deadn but i don't know who?... also why are there 2 aliens in your closet?
When most people think of anime they think of 13 year old girls with giant boobs getting raped by tentacles. Or they think of shows made for kids(or something like that xD) Trust me there are fewer kid friendly anime than adult anime series. When i think of anime i think of good 16+ series like Attack On Titan. I just watch anime for entertainment. Just like people watching their favorite tv shows. But if i ever come across a weeaboo i'm gonna stay away as far as possible. My friend's sister is a weeb and she didn't even know what a dab was until last friday..... wtf
4:11-4:20 xD killed me
My favorite anime is spongebob squarepants
hold on, the japanese stuff he says, does it actually translate to the subtitles?
If you feel like you're starting to become a weeaboo, there's a wonderful anime called Boku no Pico that will fix that.
I fucking love anime. I'm a filthy weeaboo!
i live in japan but no fucking big eye PROOF FOR WEABOOS
damn good impresion
wow just great japanese
so whats up with all the realms? like realm 900 what is that? just some random ongoing joke?
i love you
I really do think it would be dope to get a sword. Not a ninja one but like some skyrim/lord of the ring type sword
imagine his neighbors just live streaming a game or something and Frank is screaming in his room in the background.
i can't understand you go back to your country. weeaboos my ass
IM DYING
Can't a person just appreciate Japanese culture without being called a weeaboo!? I admit I love Japan, I love their food, culture, history, language, technology, art & music, as well as anime & manga, but does that make me a weeaboo? Even if I love Japanese culture, I still love my own nationality, even if there are times I wish I was born Japanese, but I wasn't, and I am proud of my nationality that I was born with and I won't trade it for anything else even if it's Japanese. Does that still make me a weeaboo? You want to know what a real weeaboo is? It's those cringey people that I always see in anime conventions that will speak like this, "You're so kawaii~desu." I literally hear this all the time. They won't even speak their native language and will only speak english and insert it with Japanese words that they can't even pronounce correctly, and trust me, I know a bit of Japanese and have lots relatives who could speak it fluently (We came from Japanese ancestry and we have Japanese relatives.) I even have two weeaboo friends (one of them was my ex-bestfriend) that needs to say a Japanese word everytime they speak. Like sugoii, kawaii, uruse, etc. It's extremely annoying hearing the same words over and over again, especially when I painstakingly try to study Japanese and I still get embarrassed to speak it in front of my Japanese uncle. And there they are, speaking like they studied it for many years, when they only learned it from watching anime. That's the real weeaboos! So stop assuming anyone who likes Japan are weeaboos! We are only appreciating a culture dumbfucks!
Tbh, my favorite anime is Shrek
I lika hentai
In the beginning he's saying he has dead people in his closet lmao
attention all weeabos:your all fucking idiots go fuck yourselves
i have a pair of sia that i told someone about with a stab dose that count

I actually want a body pillow but without some anime person on it. I just want a huge pillow because they're comfortable.
Wait I love anime and I'm kinda tryna learn Japanese for my future career so does that make me a weaboo ?
Here in Vietnam,we have the things called:"Russoboos",people who never been to Russia,but act if they know everything about the place.
Tmw you have a character from an anime as your profile pic üòÇ

I have the same wacom tablet as you :D
anime is cancer in visual form.
10:00. I'm pretty sure I know that guy irl from my school. Kill me.
I wonder how many white liquids that are supposed to be humans wasted by each weeaboo on the planet.

disgusting
They transcended the brain. Weeaboos connect all parts to their own unique elements. No one thinks this is normal. But, each people has a unique value, and the only person who can fully understand his or her values is himself.
Am I a weeaboo if i obsess over what capacitors my computer power supply uses? (The best capacitors are japanese)
Bitch, the best anime is Regular Show
my favorite anime is the Paris attacks.  the prequels good too.
Was that pigeon Percy the Pigeon??

I bet your neighbors hate yuou
The only good anime is on pornhub
Since i don't pretend to be Japanese, actually respect the reality of Japanese culture, and only enjoy anime to an appropriate extent, I can still like anime, yes? Cool. I'm gonna go for a run and get my dose of reality now since if I don't keep that balance in check there's the possibility of becoming a weeaboo. Thanks for the warning.
This was my first Frank vid
this haves to be the worst anime of all time
My favorite animes r sponge bob the nutshack and lazy town
I'd much rather read manga than watch animae.

Weeaboos remind me of Clayton Bigsby.
I bought a Japanese Katana because I believe I need to protect myself, 
And my arm strength is weak, so the katana is a perfect choice. I do love the Japanese culture, their food, and their beliefs, but I also respect my own
How to identify a Weeaboo's channel:








There's something about being a "cum dump" in the username, 
I know this because I've seen these types of channels, some of them even have 2000+ subs.
1:50 If I ever kill myself, this will be the reason...
can he really speak weeaboo or is that a voice over
there are people who watch anime and enjoy the show, and then there are weeaboos...

The holocaust is the best anime
He sounds like a Pewdiepie parody...
The fact that google's shitty automatic subtitles can tell what Filthy Frank is saying more than most other youtubers is kind of sad.
Well it's a well known fact that everyone in Japan is either a giant monster or a 13 year old girl.
Srsly bruh. Don't judge ÂÜ¨Â§© ÊàëÂÄëÂøÖÈ†à
Cory in the House is the shit
I like my anime avatar.

X-Files is my Fav Anime
I really went so deep even to watch yaoi stuff and try to learn katakana :'D became socially awkward when i WASN'T idk what kinda magic shit anime has to make you a freak in so short... also thought that japan was the only place for me but after a really long period i found series which i could talk about with friends, read  a lot of how the real japan is and kicked myself out few by few. Recently still watching a couple of animes and still wanting to visit that country but i don't want to be japanese or marrying to one anymore and i'm glad of that! I went from like SAO to BB haha
Yees boi
Everyone is a weeaboo in my school
I'm here if you need me frank

I lost my shit at "Hey Boss"
I watch it, but I still call myself an american.  I have an old WW2 katana that was a gift from my (sword) fencing instructor, only for my 16th. Would I call myself a weab? No. An average anime fan? Yes. Anime is not my life. My heart is always bound to Jurassic Park and Marvel. Thank you Frank, for giving the public closure on this matter.
I personally believe anime is not trash, but many weeaboos ruin the whole fuck out of it
Isn't Rosetta Stone a stone with three languages on it?
Anime fucking sucks kys
My friend is a weeabo. I'm not friends with her anymore.
Natsu Dragneel 4:10
my favourite anime consists of south park,attack on titan,regular show and adventure time.

My dream was 2 be a a WEEABOO
i hate anime
filthy frank is the best anime ever
Well, I have a katana NOT BECAUSE I'M AN WEEABOO, it's because I'm a brown belt in martial arts and I have to practice sword spinning xD
at 1:10 frank makes a point that can be applied to any fandom
The weebs will kill us. These fucks will  call Japanese people weeaboo believe me I've seen this before. And it gets more shitty as these fucks grow.
Too funny
HELL YEAH MAD THAD MCMICHAEL.
your waifu is shit
2:56 is what ruined the Youtube comment section forever.
+TVFilthyFrank Japan's not even xenophobic.......
i have a friend with a anime profile pic and she enjoys wayching anime like black butler ( i do to enjoy anime myself, shout out to seven deadly sins) but that doesnt make my friend a weeaboo because she doesn't like keep a mini Katana(and collect them) in her purse or she doesn't try to act all like a japanese school girl and shit..
i wish the Vytalian Royal Air Force missile strikes those Weaboos!

And thus the Cory in the House meme was born
The first time I watched this I actually thought he was a 52 year old man that only had this YouTube Channel to live for. I'm a very Gullible person.
WATASHI AM NOT A WEEABOO!! WATASHI ACTUALLY AM JAPANESE!! WATASHI KNOWS HIRAGANA AND HAS ANIME DRAWING SKILLZ! I LEARNED ALL MY JAPANESE ON ROSETTA STONE AND WATASHI KNOW HOW TO SAY WELCOME AND STUFF IN JAPANESE! IRASSHAIMASE!! SO DESU KA! KAWAII DESU NE!! WATASHI NO BAKA WEEABOO DESU NE

(I watch anime, but not a crazy weaboo)

So dont ask

I wish I could see Frank out of character.
hahahah I love this guy he's amazing and he's so funny üòπüò∏üò∏
I'm here because I was watching Gwen Steffani's Hollar Back Girl video and read some of the comments and saw "weeaboo."  I just learned the word "weeaboo" and it looks like I'm 2+ years behind everyone else? What is the origin of this word? Who made it up and first used it? How do you get "weeaboo" for a "Japanese culture lover"? And who is Filthy Frank? And why does he have to yell at me with that voice and wake his neighbors? And I knew there were anime fans out there but I didn't know it got to this level. I can't believe I watched this whole video.
My friend said something about all Japanese girls doing a peace sign in pictures (it was a no context insult towards japs)
I responded with:
"After two nuclear bombs all they want Is peace"
poor pink guy all he wants is a pusi
I seriously don't know what's wrong with this guy or how he is successful in this website, but he sure is disgusting and retarded.
please somebody answer
What is this?
I love his little ukulele
Frank's animes are also my favorite
the fuck has my life become
watching this again i just noticed filthy said rosetta stone
Anime sucks sack
No Espa√±ol
why did the anime cross the road because the weeaboos are invading
Harambe is my favourite anime character.
Would I be considered a weeaboo if I got this Attack on Titan sweatshirt? It's not a cosplay or anything, just a green sweatshirt with the Wings of Freedom symbol printed on the back. (serious question)
You should talk about Koreaboos they're bad as Weeaboos
Was clean shaven til 6:43 
Wot happened.
I ain't afraid of weeaboo even if they have a katana I have a airsoft gun I think I'm safe
YOURE CRASY
Animu iz bed
avatar is my fav anime
A weeaboo takes my school bus....
Be careful Franku, that was only a level 3 weeaboo. That's far from the worst I've seen.
ok i am an american
when you realize that 50% of the subtitles were misleading and he was actually saying some dirty shit xD
Anime is dumb as fuck
Hey...this isn't anime. what is this?
My grandpa is japenese, but I look white. I don't like anime, but I would really like to learn japenese, and when I retire, I would maybe even move there. Does that make me a weaboo
weebs are the most retarded fucks on earth

10:10 was a lot to take in
twenty third times a charm
i am not hating but his voice is making me  my cough to clear my throat
There's a really good spin off of Seinfeld called the Bee Movie. Such a marvelous anime. There's a lot of fanservice though, it's only recommended if you like bestiality
what if someone is a Hispanic amd try to be like a north America people
let me be clear, for people who hate weeaboos, we don't fucking care really we don't. Well at least we are more fucking open about things then your furry/bisexual/gay/asexual ( i dont not hate you if you are that :D ) fucks.

I get an odd Pewdiepie vibe from this.......lololol
Thank you for this video. God damn Weeaboos, they're so, distasteful.
Can you enable subtitle adding so I can add spanish subtitles?
10:19 teleports behind you
"Nothing personal kid"
I really like anime but the idiots who try to talk japanese when they are american as fuck and start putting their dick in body pillows are just plain idiots...
I'm going to get attacked for saying this but I think anime is dumb it has no plot line and just has japenese anime character running around and screaming at each other
Fist me Daddy.
All weebs will be purged
                     -The Voice In Your Head
I weep for mankind.
me üòÇ but luckily I don't think I'm Japanese. üòÇ I'm a little too 'dark'
the only reason that I would ever go to Japan is because so I can tell my weeaboo Friends and rub it in.
1:00. Agreed.
it's funny how weaboos collect swords to be more Japanese but swords and weapons are nearly impossible to get in Japan
Rorschach voice. close enough haha.
konichiwa u magnificent bastards üëè
idk i like collecting weapons and wall scrolls but because i appreciate the looks
Straight fire Frank, thanks for this education video.
XD
How does he keep a straight face throughout this video? I'm impressed.
Cory in the loud house is the worst anime
So according to this video i'm basically 20-30% weeaboo? Damn that's still pretty fuckin terrifying.. Does anyone have more symptoms so I could diagnose this disease early and save myself!?
MY WAIFU IS REAL K ?
So at the start when the subtitles say "are you ready for some fun? I sure am"

THAT IS NOT WHAT HE IS ACTUALLY SAYING AND I CANT FUCKING BREATHE
I just noticed I have been subscribed for you to a while, and I didn't ever mean to! I'm getting out of here.
3:51 always get me

I'm 1/4 Japanese but I don't really like anime
Weeaboo detection test #69 :

Attack on titan is shit

(The weeaboos will start commenting on this video)
hahaha
in the most darkest parts of America, there are weeaboos. good god
My favorite animes are buzzfeed and dramaalert

"holy shit his voice sounds like he is fucking choking on dick he might as well stuff his own cock in his mouth and say "weeboos are so disgusting rrrrr rrrr rosetta stone rrrrrrrr " you sound constipated as shit. Also calling me  a weeaboo is a very bad idea because last time someone did that i choked them unconscious and left them knocked out inside a dumpster i took a shit in"
4:09-4:20 was so spot-on xD
If Hitler was in an anime I'd watch it.
Is that frank singing that weeaboo song?
You are amazing 
And if put this in a video you will save the lives of three children
My favourite anime is the Big Bang Theory
I am Japanese that is why I was able to understand what did he say at the beginning

Dear Filthy Francis,

Love, Jacob
how do I know if my cousin is weeb
Is it wrong to use anime characters??? Like drawn stuff also this gives me a reason to watch dub lol
Someone needs to photoshop FilthyFrank's face to thomas the train's head.
I'm a japanophile woop
how many people just changed their avatar
Why did you do that with saiko? ;-;
I've never seen a Japanese Youtuber...
Frank in 60fps :3
LOL Did anyone else notice the paddle said Yaoi? Yaoi = Gay Hentai.....
i feel bad for the guy who was a weeaboo and a ginger
‚ùñ 8:03 "Etaiyo" I used google translate. It translated to "I want to do it" ... oh...
That voice he does sounds exactly like Forneverworld...
booooooooo get scard bro
filthyfrank is trolling us by making our emailboxes to 99
Hands down that's the best video of Otou-san Franku.
I like to collect medieval weapons, but weeaboos take it too far. There's a difference between collection weapons because you like how it looks, and collecting weapons because it makes you think you're japanese.
My favorite anime is Dora (btw my avatar isnt a fucking anime character)
I may have watched this video 10 times now it's forever funny
Still to this day the pigeon part is my  favorite. And it doesn't have anything to do with the fucking video XD
Love it to bits.
Pfft...lol...anime....yeaa.....whoo....Yaaaaay....
I used to be a weeaboo then I changed too a normal guy whom watches RWBY
I'd bet that your neighbors really enjoy the screaming coming from your place all the time.
im gay
Pls do furries
I know its fun to laugh at these types of people but please keep in mind that some of them might have mental health problems. Its generally sad to be stigmatized and ostracized from society

The 6000 dislikes are weeaboos
There is this kid who never leaves me alone at the start of school, he is full weeaboo! Not even in the same class, what to do?
He uses a Wacom tablet!
1) Can we all agree if you cringe to some weeb shit like "desu" and "kawaii" your not a weeaboo?

2) Would it be considered weeb if you want to go to Japan  (actually planning on doing that with 2 of my freinds in the future) I just want to see the scenery and try the food and other shit like that.
fifty two years old... what
Okay I like anime but I don't go crazy when I see a new video or when people go like omg your so weird  just f--- of

Are you Japanese Papa Frank? How did you say the opening?
lmao. I just called somebody a self-righteous faggot last night and that reminded me of that
It's like no one remembers how to play the weeaboo game. It all started in the Perry Bible Fellowship web comic. 
The first person to say "weeaboo" gets chained to a pipe and their rear smacked with a wooden paddle. 
Easy to remember rules, right?

I have been watching anime and reading manga since age 9. However, I don't collect manga, or cosplay. I thought about learning Japanese because it is a badass language, but I never tried learning it from anime. I was going to go to college for it. I use an anime profile pic because it looks cool. There are people who don't like the anime I like, but I don't say dumb crap like "its the best show ever, so don't make fun of it." people are allowed to have their own opinions. The only time I say something is when a person is clearly trolling instead of just giving their opinion. There is a clear difference between a person who just likes anime compared to a person who is so obsessed with it that they want to become anime.

Was at a meeting earlier today filled with students who want to study abroad. 
You don't have to look carefully to see whose going to Japan, their fan gear and poor grooming habits give it away. 
Along with the constant, "I know Japanese so I'm okay with getting around on my own :)"

Where are the subtitles? I cannot understand English. I only speak dank memes.
Don't forget, the word "Weeaboo" means someone who thinks they are Japanese, but they mispronounce the Japanese words and they don't know that they are actually  disrespecting the Japanese culture. They also use their parents money to buy katanas and pocky. Watching Anime or playing Japanese games does not make you a Weeaboo, but thinking you are Japanese and disrespecting the Japanese culture makes you one.
f##k you c##t go kill youburger kiltyh
Filthy Frank the weeaboos are coming for u
Breathes really hard like a Japanese school girl getting slapped in the face by a middle aged guy with a condom shoved up his nose

Looking back at this it's still fucking great lmao

ok let's test it anyma sucks
Are people honestly questioning if their weebs? A weeaboo is someone who is obsessed with Japan and thinks it's the best thing ever. Watching anime does not make you a weeaboo.
I only like anime xD, like I'm not a weeaboo but I think I know a couple of people who are.
I swear to fuck those anime impressions are the greatest
Cory in the house is the best anime
From a Japanese person interviewed on Yuta, after watching this video:  "Maybe he is basically a bit like weeaboos, and he thinks he knows better than other people, so he attacks people who know less and feels superior." 

That's exactly what it is.  You have pale skin, but speak Japanese.  To the majority of westerners, and even to the Japanese, you're in the weeaboo category too.  So own it, and make us all look better collectively, instead of scapegoating and being divisive.
Watching the utter stupidity of humanity is my favorite Hentia.
I don't think I'm a Weeaboo I just watch attack on titan.. immune friend Vivian is such a weeaboo it's almost as cringey as Jacob saggytits
Cory in the house
This is total bullshit.  This is just an attempt to distance yourself from the word by insulting other people who like the same thing as you, in order to create a separation and save yourself.  It's selfish, and petty.  Just because you don't think you're a "weeaboo,"  I promise you, there are many many others who will call you one for enjoying the culture or knowing the language.  There's nothing you can do about that.  Instead of trying to find scapegoats within your own community, how about you stop being so divisive.  Weeb Nation
4:45 im dead
papa franku how do I find the weebs

AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP ACTING LIKE I KNOW WHAT THIS SAYS!

filthy Frank you are a weeaboo.
fuck animeme
am i weaboo i like to buy manga books and some action figures and watching at online
kys fag
Funny, but mostly bullshit, just because you appreciate the culture dosnt mean that you renounce your own, i myself love anime, collecting weapons, and cos playing, just because i enjoy these things dosnt make me obsessed or a "weeaboo" whatever the fuck that means, it just means that i enjoy what the culture has to offer. and as for xenophobia, North Korea is the most xenophobic, not japan, you dont see japan holding you hostage if you enter their country, Korea on the other hand, well, i'm sure that you've seen the news. i guess my main argument is, that this video was hilarious, but mostly inaccurate, and you should do more research into the differences between an otaku, and a "weeaboo" (who's the fucking idiot who even came up with that name in the first place, it makes me fucking cringe just to say it).
cody in the house lmao
BTW, is that guy hapa?
True... As... Hell

Japan is indeed one of the world's most xenophobic cultures. They are ranked number 2: Just after the Western culture in their tremendous arrogance to call inferior not only other cultures but even people inside their own culture who are interested in other cultures and their unique cultural habits (such as masturbading to comic book characters) just because they are inexistant in western culture. I don't have a problem  with people who are enthusiastic about other cultures and nothing is more xenophobic than attacking those who are. You are an hypocrite.
if someone knows what kind of uke he has their in the corner i will suck ur dick or eat ya pussy
Bee movie is the best anime

yo. Frank what do you use for fhat beats
While we're discussing disrespecting culture, can I just ask why the fuck people seem to think us British people are stuck in the Victorian era? Seriously. We're not polite (as a country we're very sarcastic and always have been really), many of us who are younger actually hate tea, most of us are dirt poor instead of sophisticated and rich or whatever, and there's at least twenty different accents from this country depending on the county. With big areas like Essex though you get a variety. Oh, and don't let my vocabulary fool you. Most of us are incredibly stupid. So...can you guys quit with that really inaccurate stereotype?

Thank you frank. You saved me from being a weeb. Before I watched your videos I called myself an otaku, watched anime, and tried to speak Japanese and sung all the anime songs.

A few months later I realised that otaku is the Japanese equivalent of loser. Thank you for making me realise that I have wasted hours watching anime.

I think Toy Story is a great anime
When he says "Are you ready to have some fun? I sure am!", he actually says "In my closet there are 2 (something-people. Google Translate says transport ministers, but I have no clue). They're both dead."
I used to be friends with some weebs in highschool, until some of them began making jokes at my expense because I didn't get their anime/manga references. I never reacted, but they kept doing it and it became very mean-spirited, so I left. 
So not only did I discover that I was less cool than the most uncool group at school, but also that people who are picked on sometimes turn around and do it to other people, despite knowing what it feels like. 
Some of them were very nice though.

yeah i hate those guys with the anime profile pics................ o wait
Being someone who grew up in Brazil I totally get it and you're spot on. People in the states don't know what a proper otaku really means in Japan. If you claim to be one you will be automatically seen as a neet or borderline hikigamori. 

You can't ever parade into a foreign culture without doing more research than fucking anime as a whole. True that knowing Japanese will get you further but don't speak like you know the tongue. Respect the culture for what it is. 

Cherry blossoms are a symbol of the passing of season life and joy. I learnt this directly from an art tour by an old Japanese historian herself. It changed my outlook Japonisme as a whole when I go for my yearly blossom shoots.
SCREW THE WEEABOO

But Cosplayers aren't necessarily weebs
In the same way that you distract zombies with sound, you distract weeaboos with either of these phrases:
1. "Superman is better than Goku"
2. "Avatar The Last Airbender is the best anime". 
and then you run. Abandon your baby if you must. Just run.
yo dude i just like one piece i dont fuck body pillows

You should see Endigos hate comment video saying in your tone "Look, i despise weaboos as much as the next guy alright - weaboos are filthy, deseased, but they're not the problem, the problem are people who speak on behalf of papa franku- nobody, speaks on behalf of papa Frank exept papa Frank himself, are we clear" xD
papa Franku you just gave 12 yrs olds one word of insult, you added a word to their vocabulary consisting of few words "pussy" "vape" "dab" "weeds" and "gangsta"

I like Japanese weapons but I'm not a motherfucking weeaboo I just like the accent fighting weapons of the Japanese
OH MY GOD I SPEAK JAPANESE AND THE JAPANESE AT THE BEGINNING AND THE SUBTITLES DIDN'T MATCH!!!

I feel like this comment section never fully read the description. I am not that big of an anime fan, I like it but not obsessed, I'm more into the culture and wish to move there. But a lot of people call me a weeaboo whenever I point up anything Japanese. I look at myself and say, "Why am I called a weeb"? Whatever, my point is that Anyone I tell about anime thinks I  am an automatic creep because of that. That makes no sense.
Weeaboos be like...

what's a hiragana
I'm actually freaked out about how accurate this video is.
Don't talk shit about Attack on Titan, it's a really good show.

I collect Japanese weapons and I know how to use them and I am 3rd stripe black belt
Soooo. my father is japanese and Jamaican. I'm Indian and Jamaican and japanese. probably other things too. SUPER interested in japanese culture. applied to a college there. love anime. But at the same time, not only am I interested in learning THEIR language. I'm learning Jamaican. I'm learning my great great great grandmother's language. the Cherokee language. I'm learning Spanish since I have a half Spanish sister. I'm learning french cause I wanna go to paris. I'm learning Germain and Romanian, and Chinese cause I have a crush on this Chinese delivery man. And Korean because Lia Kim. Russian because I wanna be a spy. I love ALL these culture I listed. including my African ancestry. And when I get the chance I'm gonna learn more about that. And as much as I love anime, I haven't watched it in ages. Waiting for new seasons of things lol, I'm more into the fact that I would like to sing, Jpop sometimes, write songs even, that I would like to continuing writing books, that Ghibli inspires so damn much. Even to the point that i like writing books about let me say an asian girl and a half asian girl that are like... twin sisters, from different mothers or even the same mother! I also.. Really want to wear a japanese school uniform. Hopefully i will get the chance to with study abroad. And also, i want to voice act in a Ghibli film. i want to meet Hayao because omg i adore that man. But you know what- i also wanna meet, Rebecca Sugar, Alex Hirsch, because i ADORe them just as much? I'm human. oh well. if I wanna reshape my already Asian eyes to look even more Chang chong ching  (as kids would always tell.. Still DO. Thanks guys. I have Asian eyes. But I'm also INDIAN. OUR EYES LOOK THE SAME.) BUT- i listen to rap. I dance hip hop, ballet, a lot of type of dances. I wanna write an animation one day. wheither it's anime or just a nornal Cartoon THAT I WONT SAY THE NAME OF BECAUSE IM ALREADY WORKING ON ONE. I identify as Blasian, and I'm not gonna go as far as to call another human being disgusting. I call myself disgusting for already being too animated and childish and downright a goody goody. And it makes me feel bad even when I say it to myself. So Am i considered a weaboo? Even if I'm mostly infatuated with japanese culture right now because. . I'm gonna be living there in less than a year?
0:10 lol there's two maids in his closet!

this is my favorite video on the internet
Upload more
it`s clearly fact video,because when I was studying on USA,some geek used to makes me very hard(he usually ask about his fantasy about anime,Japan(I am Korean anyway) because I thought he is just common guy so I had to talk with him few times.He told he want to go Japan because he love anime and he always think Japanese girl might be interested about him even USA girl never interested about him because he is white ha,so I said ‚Äúnah,they also hate ugly guy‚Äù and then I saw his pathetic denial reality. I felt surpried because 
he was totally simmilar guy with example weeaboo on this video
It might be looks like very pathetic when Japanese meet weeaboos.

I'm not a weeb, I've only been to Japan 5 times, I believe I can speak fluent Japanese because I watch attack on Titan, I have multiple body pillows which I fuck, and I watch every anime and even the hentai. If you don't watch anime you have no life.
What about the creators of South Park? They liked the Japanese culture and spoke the language. Doesn't that make them a weeaboo?

Okay, my brother calls me a weeaboo. All I do is watch anime, read manga, and enjoy the art style  I don't have an addiction, I respect the japanese culture and enjoy the food, I really want to go there because it seems like a fun place. Rant done
The main reason I found anime is because I searched up "Bleach" in Google images, also my school is having the Boku No Pico cancer spreading around, which basically means you might get surprised buttsecks from time to time.
My question is where else do I learn Japanese. I don't have any Japanese friends.

my favourite anime is hentai 
its educative and helpful and its art
I am stuck in middle school while my friends float further and further away from me into the weeaboo furry black hole. Think about that for a moment. Imagine sitting in a room with 24 people - they're in the middle of being children that barely know shit and slutty teenagers that only praise drugs and talk excessively about sex. It's fine to discuss such matters but imagine just how fucking twelve year old's make it sound. And not only are they pretentious as fuck and immature, they're weebs. Screaming "EWEH!" out loud isn't cute, they're just trying to imitate a sound a pok√©mon barely makes.
damn bro is something stuck in your throat
am i a weeb i have anime profile pic
I like anime but I don't obsess over it like seriously it's cool but I don't understand why you would dedicate your life to anime

I like the fact that on every single site the community is Aids but when you look at porn websites its actually a very good community.
My favorite anime is Everybody Loves Raymond.
1:31 and thus, a stupidly overused joke was born.
The sad part is that most Japanese people in legit Japan look at anime the same we do. If these weebs moved to Japan, they'd be just as outcasted as they were in the US.

When I went to an anime convention once there was an evacuation/lockdown thing because supposedly some cosplayer brought real guns and shit. I WAS IN A FUCKING KIMONO AND IT WAS SNOWING.

One time on an iFunny post in which the punchline was about anime being shit, a weab said the following:"You say that... But there are millions of people around the world of all ages who love anime, and could kick your ass. Just saying. Individually, we may seem weak, but as a group, you better fucking run. We can do crazy shit, and you know it." Fucking weaboos.

Filthy Frank thanks for making these amazing videos I can't stop laughing at them. You do exactly what was the intention of humor- to turn something stupid, controversial, and/or horrible and make it tolerable for people by making it funny; and that's why I respect this channel

I had to pick a language for School to take so I picked Japanese because I didn't give a shit about Spanish or French, and I didn't realize it until a year later, but I was surrounded by weebs, I was just there because I was interested in the culture but now I sit in the back of my class and twiddle my thumbs as people argue over what anime is more authentic.





I'm dropping this class...
They're everywhere every single person in my school my classmate tried talking to me in Japanese ending every sentence in "desu" and then I roasted her in Japanese and then she said "thank you desu nee"

"Masturbating to 13 year old girls" (if you really do this on such young aged anime girls) doesn't necessarily make you a "Borderline pedophile" because you're basically just jerking off on drawings, not on real little girls.

Unfortunately there are filthy frank guys who talk like him and make weebs sound bad now.
Mein Kampf is my favorite manga. Still waiting on the Amine adaptation to come out.
I love anime. It's one of my 3 favorite things but I hate japan in general. Maybe I'd get an action figure from my favorite anime but that's it. I'd never learn Japanese go to japan or learn Japanese. I am defined as a weeb in society because I love that 5% of anime.

Im a furry do i win?
He should've hit on how deluded weaboos are CERTAIN that if they could JUST get to Japan, that women would flock to them all hornball because they're American. Meanwhile, Japan's one of the most racist places on this planet lol. Yeah, you'd be a novelty, but still seen as a joke.
Where has this guy been all my life?
People who get offended by this video remember he is half Japan.
Spongebob is my favourite anime <3

Teletubbies is a Beast anime hands down
did he just call anime a fucking japanese cartoon
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
anime is gay
Is it really hard to just SIT YOUR ASS DOWN and normally watch anime without having the urge to disgustingly dress up as an imaginary character, or annoyingly try to speak Japanese, (THINKING you partially underatand it), just from hearing five words in a series, or joining a pointlessly butthurt fanbase arguing daily about what's better than what?!
Are you actually Japanese?
lets get some pussy tonight!
#rosetastone
oh God my brother is a weeoboo!?!?
so is pinkguy filthyfrank
Oh god this is the truth
LOL
I just got fucking roasted. Holy shit.
this is actually really offensive, this should be considered bullying because there are weeaboos watching this and they take it offensive. it's OK to be weeaboo, katanas are actually more dangerous than normal swords cause they are more sharper
Weeaboos need to calm the fuck down. I'm into anime, I'm not gonna lie. But I stay in my lane. I don't own anything except a couple anime movies and manga. I don't act like a person from Japan the second I walk into a restaurant and try to speak Japanese. I don't do that, like seriously, calm the fuck down
1:05 as long as I stay being a "person who just likes anime" and not go to the wrong path of disrespecting/denouncing my own original culture (middle european), I should be doing alright, I hope... I can still try to learn japanese, right?
6k weaboos disliked the video
am totally with frank >:(

what the hell is wrong with some ppl

as frank says:


.

.

FUCK YOU ! !  >:-(
"There are two people in my closet" = "Are you ready to have some fun"

Jeez! At least get a sao replica sword, or aot.
Eh. I'm not triggered. I watch lots of anime. I only watch anime because it has lots of action. I'm not addicted to anime. I watch like 7 animes like, Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online, Fullmetal Alcumist, Pokemon, Dragon Ball Z, Erased, and Relife. (But I don't watch Naruto). I freaking read the Legend of Zelda manga! Plus, the people where so ugly. I only like sword fighting because, I'm a huge Legend of Zelda fan.
okay. here's a way to trigger a weeaboo...

One Punch Man sucks
I just like naruto
The amount of sounds that are made in this video makes my family question what I watch in my free time

Gotta say, you can make fun of any anime, but don't you dare put your filthy hands on my Power Puff Girls you bitches!!!
Attention: please do not fuck your body pillows. Or toy figures. Or helicopters. looking at you Papa Franku
....... there is absolutely no other way I can put this in the words of my own that this video is correct
Anime is fine but if it gets to the point where you're f**king body pillows you need to kill yourself. This is not an insult it's just the only way for the rest of the human race to survive. And you're safe if you're Japanese.
intense breathing

LOOLLL
I'm umm scared in human society
Who else sees comments about hating weaboos and they have animes as profile pics
Is liking Vocaloid and anime being weeaboo
I've been trying to find the accounts with anime profile pictures ranting.
People with anime avatars are disgusting.
My favorite animes consist of:
Big Brother
Five Nights At Freddy's

Halloween must be a good time for weeaboos
Filthy Frank speaking Japanese is my new love

I was slightly weaboo when I was like 12 but thankfully I became self aware before it was too late XD Anime's pretty cool and I take Japanese as a language/culture class at school but that's it. It sparked my interest in animation and dreams of working in disney or cartoon TV networks which is great. Weebs are absolutely disgusting.... but I feel bad cuz they really need a reality check.
The weeaboos are coming....
https://youtu.be/OFQQALduhzA
See I have an anime character as my pic (well at the moment it's Homestuck) it's because I don't want people knowing who I am. I am not a weeaboo even though I watch anime

Weeaboo Jones: Rosetta Stone.
dubbed anime is better than subbed
the fake frank has to be a weeb, that must be reason he took over the channel
I would rather play 2 board games then each henti sorry if that is misspelled üòë
My favorite animes consist of Wallace and Gromit, Bob the Builder, Initial D, Phineas and Ferb, and most of all the Matrix
What of I have a collection of various Japanese and non Japanese weapons but know how to use them??
Fucking weeaboos xd
I have a hentai avatar on my PornHub account.

Ey b0ss
I watch anime and unfortunately, he is kind of right, cuz, I am not a weeb, but I know some people, who are borderline weebs and they have seen the video and like me, they agree that he is unfortunately accurate...
Well this was actually accurate, and I watch anime.
I just like anime. I am NOT a weeaboo
mmmm, 2 dead jews in ur closet
is it just me or subs were not matching what he was saying?
I use anime profile pictures lol
Papa Franku! I have just thought of something! What if Japanese people watch anime but they always watch the anime while it's in English and they denounce there culture and learn English through the English anime. Would that make them a weeaboo?????? PLS PAPA FRANKU! I NEED ANSWERS! Also please don't mind my profile pic.......
does anybody else here really like fairy tail?
Is it okay if I can use a weapon to defend myself if a weeaboo attacks me because I said that anime was shit

Real Japanese- narrow eyes
Anime characters- fucking basketballs
can someone translate what the Japanese bits mean again?
papa franku is quite good at speaking japanese tbh
6k dislikes üòÇfuck you weaboos
Idk but I literally died when Frank said:
Anime Cartooon
Where can I get a filthy frank body pillow
oh ok so I'm not a weaboo I thought I was just because I watch a little bit of anime
Your voice turns me on
This guy is fire lol
Holy shit his voice is so harsh
Oh shit. Wrong video...
same with koreaboos. "ANY ARMIES HERE?"
So I used to be super into anime and eventually it led to my interest in Japan itself. I stopped with anime altogether (aside from maybe an occasional movie or short series) as I grew up and actually became interested in becoming a teacher in Japan for the simple fact that I appreciate Japan and I was like damn as an American I really think we need to have good relations with Japan because they're an advanced free nation...anyways I learned a lot of Japanese so I can understand quite a bit and now that I can understand so much I finally realize why it's SO ANNOYING WHEN ANIME FANS SAY KAWAII DESU AND GENKI DESU KA AND AISHITERU AND DAISUKI ALL THE TIME LIKE FUCK DUDE. I am def glad he made this video because there is a line between appreciation for Japanese culture and literally a gross misinterpretation and sick obsession of it. The only Japanese media I really deeply enjoy now is music...but honestly people need to realize that an obsession with anime SHOULD NOT BE AN OBSESSION WITH JAPAN. Japan is not anime. Just like 90210 and Keeping Up With the Kardashians arent America. You can be very obsessed with anime...but please leave it at that. An anime obsession. Don't act like Japanese people are some sort of characters lmao they're human beings...
i give you a plastic dick if you eat that pidgeot xD
I love quoting this video to my friends who are almost weeabos.
Why do no weeaboos know that most eatin' places in Japan don't use chopsticks? They are still in use, but not as much as they were 10 years ago.
Ey b0ss........ CAN I HAB DA PUSI PLS!?
How to flame war 1. Sao is shit 2. Wait
Fucking Jap's, we still remember WW2.
Hahaha, Cowboy Tanaka  XD
Did someone say "Weeaboo" ',:)

One of my favorite filthy frank vids
I am a weaboo but I sure can agree to frank
lol
man I love Cory in the house
Omg I also love Cory in The House!
i agree
This guy is bit creepy and funny
Why is him speaking Japanese so attractive though
but what if you actually like the culture and the language
hahaha how more epic can you be! subscribed!
fuck you weabo Jones; I love battlefield
I collect swords from anime but I just like how they look and that they look like the ones in anime because to be hounest the weapons from anime look sick
Hmm... Cory in the house- nah. Blues Clues is my favorite. But it got shitty in the 2 season.
What's worse? Weebs or furries?
you actually sound normal when you speak japanese... holy crap!
Lol
12:00

my favourite anime is clorox bleach

Curry üçõ in the house is the best animu
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I used to follow the Best of Tumblr page on Facebook and one time I dissed anime and I got death threats and got turned into a meme on a thread of about 100+ comments. My cousin and a I had a good laugh over those. Then I got banned from the page, but by that time I had figured out how cancerous Tumblr is and I didn't care
i feel offended on the 4:10 part
Sweet mother of god.....
what the fuck did i just watch
arschloch
Filthy Frank is my favourite anime
omg HOW DARE YOU TALK SHIT ABOUT WEEABOOS I WILL KILL YOU!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Theres only two genders...

YOU ARE THE TRUE WEEABOO FROM JAPAN
Are you jews?
I am so not a weeaboo and I love it. But still wish I could go to Japan
The weebs...
i remember watching this when it first came out 2 years ago
I don't think anybody here is on my anime expertis level
FilthyFrank: if you watch a little hentai on the down-low, I don't give a shit
Me: YES!
0:32 Thank you! You are the only person on the god damn internet that uses the term, Weeaboo correctly. How many people use the term incorrectly is just plain irritating.
A weeaboo attacked me before
2 years later and still funny as hell
I've always wondered why people kept saying their favorite anime was Cory in the House in the comments section throughout Youtube.
does he actually speak fluent Japanese?
very fluent Chinese. I love it. Very nice.
I don't know why American people like anime, when they attack Pearl Harbor. Anime is from Japan, and Japan attack on Hawaii, started Pearl Harbor. History are fucking mess up.
Urban dictionary
koros!
how he speaks Japanese is cringy yet impressive üòèüòí
attack on titan is actually really good :1
First Comment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The opening is hypnotizing.
Yeah, anime profile pictures are fucking cancer!

Mein Kampf is my favorite manga
Ouh
Omg his voice is so fucking annoying
I'm still not sure if I love filthy frank, or absolutely hate him. There is one thing I am sure about... I'm not some cartoon loving weeaboo! Full disclosure, I do actually kind of like anime.
konya
„ÉØ„É≠„Çø ( > ‚ô°<)\m/~~~‚òÜ

I watch this video at least once a week. Bless you Papa Franku.
this gave me so much satisfaction
I didn't know what a weeaboo was until now. I'm just going to say you described my older brother perfectly. Fucking weeaboo
I really enjoy watching anime. I hope nobody gets offended by this video. He is just expressing his feelings about something. Same as some other people. I also found this video very funny.
So KAWAII
1:05 voice crack-ish
Who wants a percaholic to destroy the weaboo
My anime profile is kancolle collection go watch it your old enough
Do they just rent out random office buildings for these videos
9:45 "Harambe here I come!
wow he has 2 dead people in his closets
if i saw Weeaboo Jones i'd probably run and cry because of the way he walks üò≠
5:10 if a Japanese person were to do that it would be racist watching anime, collecting things, and learning Japanese isn't racist
RUN FROM ALL THE WEABOOS
the pidgin might not have been a pidgin it might have been STEAVEN SUGUL
Fucking weeaboos going to japan be like " whe- whe-where are the subtitels?"
holy shit lmao the way weeabo jones walks
lol
does singing openings count
the moment I say "I like watching anime"(and no more than that srsly I'm NOT an otaku or weaboo)everyone starts yelling "WEABOO!!""OTAKU!!"(its fucking annoying)
I like Nintendo. That's about it, really. I'd watch anime, but I have the same problem with anime that I do with MLP, other cartoon shows, all television in general, and comic books:

I ain't got time for episodic shit!
The 6k who disliked are weeaboos
why do people hste you so much your funny has hell
10:10 wtf guys like if yo agree ffs

one of my friends is a weeb but he denies it. stage 1: denial
I just noticed that frank would be an awesome voice actor even for English dubs.
7:56 actually hentai sounds fx
Fuck anime.
How come when a woman gets a vibrator it's seen as a naughty bit of fun. BUT when a guy orders a 240 volt Fuckmaster Pro 5000 blow-up latex doll with 6 speed pulsating pussy, elasticised anus with non-drip nut collection, together with optional built-in realistic rape scream 7.1 surround sound system, he's called a pervert

I feel you filthyfranktv I wanted to be Tomas the tank engine to rip :(
i am butthurt
I'm one of those people that just like watching anime but why would you buy a katana that you can't even use?Or a body pillow these things are pretty expensive.Why do these idiots just waste money on these stupid things?And why are they mostly 30 year old white men living in their mothers basements with cumstains on their bed sheets and some a Hatsune Miku wallpaper.If you enjoy watching anime like me then just watch it instead of trying to pretend you're Japanese.
Good thing China doesn't have to deal with this shit....
oh wait...

WEEABOOS     its why bleach exists
I like good anime, such as Cowboy Bebop, but then again, I fap to Spike Spiegel, so does that make me weird?

Full Metal Jacket is my favorite anime
(I've never gone to Japan, so crucify with discretion) I think that Japanese are like normal people, they just have a different language and different animating styles
Bro, I am Japanese and that last phrase where he said, "Are you ready to have fun?" And, "I sure am!" was totally messed up.
He did not say those phrases in Japanese, he said, "I have two girls in my closet. They are both dead."
WTF!?!?!?!?!?!?!

his face gets so red when he does this xD
7:45 :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
My nipples are hard
My buddy nick is a weeaboo just because he's 38 and jerks off to 13 year old anime girls doesn't mean he's a pedophile

I got up morning over at my friend's house. I woke up to her singing Japanese words, a song she made up. She was literally saying "Arigato, Maisuki-chan! Sumaio, Co MA kon-nichiwa", Like wtf. I asked her what she was doing. She turned around. She was wearing a highschool japanese uniform and a Hatsune Miku wig. idk when she got it, but she's never told me about it. We aren't friends anymore :'D
I looked in the comments for people with anime profile pictures

PLEASE COME BACK TO US üò≠üò≠üò≠
I remember reading about a guy who bought a pair of inflatable legs, a fleshlight, and silicone tits for his waifu pillow and dressed it up in panties and stockings to make it look more realistic.
I'm glad I don't see many of (if any) these types of people at any of the conventions I go to.
Idk why people love this shit, animes are gay.
--- dislikes from weeaboos/bronies
cory in the house is my favorite anime
theres nothing wrong with anime avatars, as long as its not hentai LOL
I hate all of those gay weeaboo faggots who have anime profile pics, it gets really fucking annoying.
Ok but I know an actual weeaboo and I called myself a weeaboo in a satirical manner, but she was like "Holy shit I hate the word  'weeaboo." And I'm just like "Probably because you're actually a weeaboo and don't want to admit it" I didn't actually say that, but I wish I did so I could have seen her be all "Triggered" lmao. Bitch doesn't even know how to humor.
Thomas the frank engine

If I bought one katana and like, hung it on my wall or something, would I be a weeaboo?
will buying one Katana type of sword due to one's respect for Dark souls 3, bloodborne or the Witcher 3 considered being a filthy tweaboo. like only for decoration to these games. like not a collection, but just for symbolising. pls I desperately need an answer. my intentions are pure and not weeaboo-ish

Is this where the 'Cory in the House was the best anime' meme is from?
My favorite anime character is Filthy Frank.
This video is pretty naruto like
The only reason I would ever get triggered by anything weeaboo, is because most fucking people who use the term doesn't know the definition. U dumbasses
To true Frank
thank god i dont use an anime avatar haha
i have a waifu. im disgrace to entire anime community.

cri
How come he's so good with the Japanese pronuntiation!
I like "Corey in the house" ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Anything but anime. Don't touch anime.
I was reading the manga "Fairy Tail" at school one day and I passed out then a dude sitting next to me saw the cover and called me a weaboo.
#WeebPride
I watch a lot of sword art online i saw the part when kirito and asuna kissed i had a boner

Yeaaah filthypieceofscum you are right
8:51

I thought I was a weaboo cause I watched anime like Cory in the House. (I actually do watch anime.) But I don't think I'm Japanese, I don't buy Japanese merch and weapons, and I RESPECT THE AUTHORETE- er, I mean culture. So I guess I'm not. (Joke incoming) inhales You talking shit about animes about pigeons ya cunt?
I just like anime
oh my godXD
Third time ive seen this now üòÇüòÇ
I do it ironically
9:18 RESHIRAAAAAAM.
I can't even respect people who watch anime because its literal a shitty cartoon adaption of a comic book.
Omg Frank is so right. I live in Birmingham, England and I know some American students who attend my University who call themselves Japanese. I mean, seriously just because you say your Japanese does not mean you instantly transform into Sailor Moon or some shit. xD
Pure art.
lol i wonder what would happen if filthyfrank and miranda sings would do a crossover
lol weeaboos are shit but you look pretty nerd for making fun of them is kinda call out the rapists when you are a pedophile hahaha
does Nigguto count as anime
good think I am japanese
WTF! ATACK ON TITAN IS THE BEST FUCKING SHOW....
Animuh is stooped

attek of titen zuckz
6000 pathetic weeaboos disliked this video
U luv me sempi
Cory in the House is overrated. "Deleting System32" Is the best anime
If someone is a weeaboo that you know, just show them Frank and say "This is a real Japanese person."
Then sit back
Relax




And watch them slowly die realising their life was a lie.
I'm 1/3 Japaneese 1/3 Filipino 1/3 Russian and I hate anime (except Pokemon Indigo and Johto) and I know this guy who thinks that he looks Asian because he has a flat face, so he watched every anime and makes his white mom pack him rice. He smells like shit and thinks he knows Asian culture. In my opinion he's a weeaboo
now its 14 million views haha papa frank will still be a youtube legend hah
i have friends that actually  tried to change his vocals to sound like anime
Filthy frank is really a weeaboo.
its the 2 year anniversary of Pappa Franku's most poular video... i just thought id mention that....

My favorite anime is filthy frank
I'm new here. I'm scared
Anime is stupid
What does he says after "welcome everybody"? Something with" 2 in my closet" xD....the captions doesn't fit hahahaha, can weeb-b0ss help me please xD?
What does he says in the beginning xD? After welcome everyone the captions doesn't really fit the text hahaha... Something with 2 in a closet. Can a weeb help please :p?
i used to be a weeaboo, then i saw this video and i killed the weeaboo side of myself, thank you papa franku
can we have a video of filthy frank speaking Japanese in a whole video?? he sounds so frickin cool xD
Im so fucking white.
I walk this lonely road, with a Naruto mug I stole, watching anime drinking bleach and banging my waifus... ohhh oh oh I walk alone I walk alone.... I'm sorry XDD
Yes Cory in the house is the best anime as everyone knows
Good video, but Youtubers who looks at themselfes in the cameras screen instead of looking into the lense is too damn high! So facking annoying!

Frank,
You and all of your subscribers must take down this new species called Americanus weebus. If we do not stop them they will take America AND Japan over. I think you should spread awareness of this new breed of weapon collecting 32 year old men. They are armed with katanas, body pillows, and 900 discs and SD cards of anime shit, hentai, and Rosetta Stone shit. I say we take down this new terrorist group that will continuously attack America and Japan. TELL CHIN CHIN OF THIS PLAUGE HE'S PRESENTED US WITH! IT'S TIME TO STOP!
;)
wait hes 52??
so if say something about anime I will summon a weaboo let's test :Naruto SUCKS
Hey what is up guys? Scarce here.

Right because Japanese people don't go and get plastic surgery specifically to look more caucasian..... mhmmm

He said he's 52, wtf, i don't understand.

Damn frank you teach some great life lessons
I don't know why I put watching this off for so long.
i think like 89% of the dislikes are Weeaboos. 
who else thinks this? :-/
what are you talking about Cory In The House is a good anime
dont know why...but Frank reminds me of Brandon Rogers....
Weaboos or virgin retards
After watching this, so does weeaboos mean really old people who bought like an example a pillow with a anime girl, weapons from japan or from an anime, saying words they heard from anime but know absolutely know nothing from it, and dresses up as their anime character. I can agree one thing with this video the anime pillow obsession needs to stop
yes
hey y'all, who came first this guy or pewds?

I play cod online so I'm probably a weeb

You like Cory in the House!?!? Thats the absolute best anime!!
if a foreigners who likes anime and stuff about japan is weeaboo then what do you call that ppl you have poster or things collections about 1D, HighSchool musical, etc...that not related to anime.

Franku used to be way funnier. his recent videos are too forced.
^You may not be Thomas the Tank Engine but you are pretty dank tho. I guess nobody saw this one coming.

Also, hands down, you'd be awesome as a dubbing actor for anime. Doesn't even matter if it's in Japanese or English.
what anime was 10:20?
just look at my prof pic btw im not a weeaboo
i lost it when he said "Harro, my name izz cowboy tanaka" xD
I completely lost it during the weeaboo song.
It's like.. when the pigeon comes, Frank gets sad and says "This is my house :(" you can hear it in his voice... he's sad... just go away pigeon nobody likes you
That shirt looks pretty clean actually.




Wait, you're 54?
And heres were the triggered weeaboos come flooding in.

Lego Movie is the best anime
Seinfeld Anime is soooo underrated.
I have found weeaboos in my moms attic...
God I hate anime and anyone who watches/likes it. Fucking looking at it makes me physically ill
HEY!What's wrong with having a collection of the most badass swords in the world?
You don't even have to like Japan,but if you don't admit that Katanas are pretty fucking cool...well then man...i don't know what to say.

And you CAN use them. Exemple Gratia-
 A burglar comes into your house,you don't have a gun,what do you do?
PULL OUT THAT BADASS KATANA THAT YOU BOUGHT ON EBAY FOR A HUNDRED BUCKS!

Just don't go overboard.

Hey bosi
Tbh I like anime and I cosplay sometimes so I'm not a full blood weeb but then again I do have like 15,000 waifus and that weeb montage gave me hope but idc what I am
I genuinely feel bad for those types of people
Oh hello
Mm mm... Thoosse curvy boobs.
I watch hentai and I like it
i like one punch man ._. dont tell my table
I wish I could have the courage to act like a weeaboo, i mean for me they act freaking funny, but I think thats unrespectful too, I love Japan and their ancestral culture so in that orden I respect them that mucho (much), grettings from Mexico by a Mexican guy.
Is Filthy Frank japanese? Is he an american-japanase? Was he born in Japan? Like where does this dude come from?
IVE NEVER LAUGHED SO FREAKING HARD
that raspy voice he does is fuckkn stupid
it's okay I also wanted  to be Thomas the tank engine bot the in 3rd grade I new that would never happen
that pigeon part was so funny
anime was a mistake
breathes heavy i find this video really offensive and it should be removed and also i feel extremely triggered and offended i hope your channel gets a community guidlines strike fgt
Attack On Titan is pretty good though.
my favorite anime is the nutshack.
Im everyones senpai ull all have to battle it out for the all important ME

Is this where the Cory in the house anime meme started?
All you weeaboos telling people to get a life, yet all you do is sit in front of a screen and obsess over anime all day
anime sucks
I wish he mad a video of koreaboos
"...end up pronouncing it wrong and looking like a complete idiot" coming from someone who can't tell the difference between their and there

It's funny I got an ad for "battle girls x". Very weeaboo
you can hear him say "oh shit mom" at 4:44
i like how you laugh at yourself
is my profile picture anime enough
No joke I wanna meet someone who is the the japanese equivalent of an american weeaboo, obsessed with american culture, claiming to know english after watching gravity falls, Adventure Time and the whats it face show about bears (not that kind), collects bb guns, and talks about going to New York City.
man it's 2 years to the day and I still love this video
4:38-4:45 = ded üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
why am I smiling?

My favorite anime is The Wiggles.
The only thing worse than the internet weeaboos are the emo music fans on the internet that name themselves "PHANIC! at the Fall Out Chemical Pilots"
i was at school and a girl was wearing a gay anime shirt and said anime is great
I'd like to visit Japan. though I'd be completely fine with not visiting there if I can just get some authentic japanese food. really food I see on anime, tv and movies is the only reason I want to visit any other country
One of the best I've seen yet
Are you trapped in the first realm?
You are the real frank!!!!
watch pink guy
stfu song
The black Weeaboo in the video is actually a pedo, and is now serving 10 years in prison for illegal pr0n
my favorite anime is elmo
I personally like anime but HATE WEEABOOS
50 likes and I'll post of a video of me naked
Anime Is COMPLETE SHITTTY SHIT SHIT
lol. awesome video. my friend had the same kind of obsession with Korea. I would make a joke of something she likes and she'd start cussing at me and defend it with her life.
Filthy frank sounds smarter when he speaks Japanese

Oh shit franks 52? Good on ya man! You look like you're in you're early 30's to late 20's!
I'm the least weeb anyone can ever be. I watch one anime, plus its one of the more popular ones, and I watch it in English. You know how some people get angry when its in English, I get angry when its in Japanese. so if you call me a Weeaboo, suck my dick





who knows I might like it if you know what I mean
ITS BEEN TWO YEARS TODAY
I ask my friend if she is a weaboo, she says no. During music class, she watches anime and Yandere shit.
Wow, I felt like watching this again and it's right on the vid's birthday! The view's quadrupled! Congrats!

CONGRATIULATIONS WEEABOO VIDEO ON YOUR SECOND BIRTHDAY!
4:18 Frank needs to do anime voiceover work haha
Omg so this is where that "cory in the house is best anime" came from LOL
truly the words of a God
4:11
Top 5 most brutal anime battles of all time.
Show us the way, master
the fuck is wrong with your voice
That weeaboo ruined Inu Yasha forever.
has anyone else noticed that At 9:20 the writing looks a lot like "hooters" which is a cheeky term for bewbs
That flawless-sounding Japanese right into "Konichiwa, you magnificent bastards!" got me
I dunno, the weaboo at 9:20 seems to be doing just fine.
Hey +TVFilthyFrank The direct translation of hentai is pervert correct? So by watching hentai, your technically a pervert, correct?
Anime sucks
I hate weeaboos
"I have two jews in my closet. Both of them are dead"- FF 2014
Papa Bless
Your voice sounds better in your language
I love Pokemon ! He's my favorite zelda character from call of duty .
Not to point fingers but there's a girl named Kaitlyn at my school and she is a weeaboo
Welp, it's October 2016, and this was the first video I saw with Franku. 
It's been 2 years, and I've reached the point of no return.
Ok so I watch anime, I actually like the Japanese culture, I want to take classes and learn about there cultures and traditions. As well I like some anime shows, not fucking school girl amines where they try to fuck each other in each episode. I watch shows like AOT, Inuyasha, FMA, shows where there's sword fighting and it's taken place in the olden times whatever the fuck you wanna call it. Ok so, does this make a weeaboo? Plz someone tell me
inb4 unfunny trolls recommending boku no pi---- oh wait, when you scroll down there's already a bunch of stupid overused jokes. Shit posters.
anime sucks...





what have i done?
355,000!!!!!
thanks frank, NOW I REALIZED MY COUSIN IS A FUCKING WEABOO
Áóõ„ÅÑ„Çà
HAHAHAHA this guy is hilarious
Betch befor I washed this viadeo I sniffed a up ake 8 pound sjsno of Coke!$$/9:'miss,mdcf

yyeeeesss
my favorite anime is icarly
Cory in the house best anime by far
My favorite anime is shrek and emperors new groove
This mans voice is so gravely it makes Batman sit in a corner and go over his life choices.
I got an anime ad before this
7:45 XD
No way in hell Frank is 52...
breathes heavily s-senpai
He's actually very talented at singing shit
I thought my mom would be so against me watching your videos, she fucking loves your content man I was SO surprised.  Keep it up :)
Turn in subtitles when he's speaking Japanese
You know for a white dude . . . . . your Japanese is pretty good.üòä
I love when he says "...eh....RosettaStone
XD Hiragana is for the baby!
I completely understood the video until 6:03 and it took a took a turn for weeaboo central
"it makes you a borderline pedophile". So Japanese?
What is being weaboo but for Ireland called. (I come from a line of alchoholics)
i love anime :D 
i watch loli animes :D
i watch magical girls anime :D
i fap to traps :D (no not rly,)
Anime sucks
im glad i didn't get into any of that stuff
1:05 we can all learn something from this
GIRUGAMESH
Filthy Frank says a few anime's is okay. But everyone takes it one anime is weaboo. Going too far.
the truth
almost 2 years
U THINK THIS IS FUNNY?!?!?! I FIND THIS OFFENSIVE
I want a piece of Percy's ass
Prejudice Equality... Aso known as socialism
4:30 omg üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
How the fuck did i land here - ive been watching "How to be a true slav"
I hear what you are saying... but fuck culture it's slowly killing humanity.
My favorite anime is the presidential debate
don't talk shit about attack on titan it's a really good show
My favorite anime is lazy town
My favourite anime is Pokemon, the first anime I watched and the last anime I watched.
Don't talk shit about attack on titan its a good show üò£ ~rawr XD
Made myself a custom shirt. "Anime:Why God abandoned us."
so that you didn't get that assüòúüò¢
I'm not gonna lie, I love Japan, I love anime, and frankly japanese is fun to learn (though somewhat difficult being raised on english), But frank has a point. Some people take it too far and this is what they become. I enjoy anime because it's fun to watch, I love japan because it's a beautiful country with a very diverse culture, and I love this show because it shits on everything no matter what it is. People with body pillows who are asking themselves "why don't I have a girlfriend?" need to think about their life. 

The actual reality of the Weeabu culture is, as he put it, sad. You deny your citizenship and your birth parents' race to identify as a culture you only vaguely know about because of an animated japanese cartoon. At least study the culture and compare it to your own, because there's a reason suicide rates are high in Japanese high schools.


Plus weapons are fun, everyone can admit that you feel powerful carrying around a gun, even if it's just under a concealed carrier licence.
Im actually half japanese. I live in Japan, and i see these people EVERYWHERE I GO
I have only 1 sword for weapon class ps where are sub
I hope weebs are a joke
I have a weeabu friend who I used to skip school and watch hentai with. He's now in Japan working in the shipping industry. He's living quite nicely there, maybe it is because he look like a Japanese that he blended quite easily. Nice guy.
Lololololololol
I LOVE hornswoggle does that mean i'm a weeaboo?
hey boss
9:57 PBG, is that you???
I'm actually half Japanese, and I must say that Southpark is my all-time favourite anime! :-D Downton Abbey is a close second, and my favourite anime character of all time would have to be a tie between Snoopy and Tyrion Lannister. Long live anime, in all of its glorious anime glory! üòú
Pff,hahaha XD
Lol so true, but I feel like the kpop fandom is just as bad haha
So why the hell do weeaboos think that a body pillow of a CARTOON girl is considered as an ACTUAL girlfriend?
Ya Percy, that nigga got a nice assss
shit.
hah buzzfeed came on as an ad
voice crack at 1:04
Favorite anime is Se7en, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Fight Club, Attack on Titan, Deadman Wonderland, Deadpool, and Taxi Driver!
the Rwandan genocide is my favorite anime
hey whats up guys it's scarce here and he have some big news we might do a double upload and flithyfrank you guys know him he has a youtube channel with 3 million subs and he talked shit about weaboos crazy
My sister is a weaboo
E Y Y  B A W S S
WEABOO'S LIVES MATTER
What if u wanna be an anime character for halloween
did Thomas dock u?
anime sucks
To be fair, attack on titan is pretty damn good.
Your videos are absolute gold
Yume o oe. Hayaku yare yo. Ch≈çdon'node, kin≈ç, ashita settei sa remashita

so god damn true. HATE those type off people.
Fuck Weebs
ians little laugh in the backround oMg
xDDD this shit is halrious :D
your fucking right
I like anime lol but I ain't giving a shit when someone talks shit about my favourite anime xD
Fucking Corey in the House. Good lort
People have changed.
ah
aneemay,
This is my first filthy frank video xD I shouldn't have come here I'm in danger of joining the community
So im not a weaboo yay
Look, I know this guy isn't meant to be taken seriously, but I don't see the problem with owning a katana and learning how to use one. Sure we don't live in fucking medieval Japan where that would serve any use, but nor does Archery yet it's still a sport or something to do on your off time among many people in the 21st Century. That's how I feel about kenjutsu. And I don't own particularly the same quality Katana that would be made in Japan, but I do own a battle ready, high carbon steel katana for practice (and I've practiced for 2 years now with a one of those bokken beginner's swords, I trust myself with a real one).
Why do I love this guy?
"if you want to waste money on shit you can't even use" says the smoker.
4:11 lol
I like collecting weapons but not stupid weapons from an anime or anything. I do like the inventions from japan though and they do create some pretty cool stuff but people that are weeaboos ruin it all!!!!!
Fucking disgusting. Now do bronies and furries.
Âì¶Êãç or Âì¶ÂìÅÁâå Ôºü
Is the loading screen a good anime to?
if your body pillow sticks to the wall, then you know you're a weaboo
If you own a samurai sword/katana/whatever, because you think it's awesome, beautiful, decorative item and like weapons, fine, that's cool.
But if you own a samurai sword, because of anime, then there's a serious problem with you
HEY EVERYBODY I JUST ENCOUNTERD A WEEABO SAYING SHES A OTAKU WHAT DO I DO?
U earned a sub
My favorite  anime  is  Black Butler
This girl at my school has 'cosplay katana'. If sharpened it can actually kill someone.
how to be jewish?Be vegans <3
Seinfeld is easily my favorite anime. It's a little long and they never put out that OVA but Jerry has talked about the reboot movie for a while, I just hope the production company hasn't lost their touch since the 90s.
patient mental state: weeabo
I have a anime profile picture, it's from Toaster Art Online.
gamingsausage
everyone if you want the retarded megasecule skype here
fine lets test this out if there will be a flood of hate
"anime sucks"
...
..
nope nothing.
when I die atleast I had a good life and forget the crap friend I had
Ur 52?
I had people who are my friends that distance themself from my other friends because they are weeabo
4:35 = face of cancer a.k.a. Weeaboo
the face frank makes at 4:15 is fucking gold.
how did it take me so long to find this guy
I'll never understand those people with anime avatars
+emilythereal
I wish I knew Chinese or Japanese, that shit is difficult.
I wish all Japanese people knew proper karate or judo or whatever the fuck.
Does Francis of the Filth actually know Japanese? Fuckin weeaboo.
had a weeaboos in my Class when i was in highschool... every night before bed i prayed that satan himself would skullfuck her go death.
Tmw when he can speak better Japanese~ In a better Anime accent~ xD
your a beawoo
Favorite hentai: the filthy frank show
Have you ever thought that anime is japans way of saying "hey can we have a third nuclear bombing"
THIS IS FUCKING BRILLIANT
Does it make me a weaboo if I wanna learn how to properly throw knives as a hobbie?
cory in the house is the shit
I didn't think people like that were real, I thought that was a internet joke.
ive watched this five times
Cosplay?
I actually agree with this vid, I LOVE anime but I'm not one of those ppl...who try to speak Japanese...and think they know all about it....and try to use a katana in pubic, that is too far, those are what I like to call...a disgrace to our already weird as fuck community ;3
i bet people in other countries that own shotguns get made fun of for being a USS version of a weeaboo
Some people in the WeeaBoo song actually look Japanese tho...
I studied Japanese in college and studied there for a year. The weeaboos that I was forced to associate with annoyed the hell out of me. *shivers*
I have Vegeta as my prof pic and everyone knows DBZ so am I a fucking weeb faggot
is this his real fucking voice?
Personally, all my friends were like "YEA, AND THEN ERIN CUT THE TITANS NAPE" and I have no idea what the fuck they are even talking about. I mean, I tried watching anime.. But, I just didn't get it.
I'm taking a shot at weeaboos here I HATE ALL ANIME EXEPT SAO
what would you do if the world was infected with weeaboos and anima characters in real life...?
iam gonna start a war I'm gonna type anime is gay on a anime channel
LOL,I like Steins Gate,Ergo Proxy,Charlotte,Monster, watch if you dare your mind xD
so.. I'm japanese my self and i really don't even know that much about Japan (i wasn't born there) and i always had friends who would talk about this anime shit and I'm just like. "The hell are they talking about?" and then they ask me weird ass questions and I'm like no.... So i had this one friend who was a mad weaboo, i was twelve at the time and then he asked me to stay over night at his house, so i went.... That son of a a bitch made me take off my shoes at the door, so i did i was chill about it, then i walked into his room and he just said look at my waifu, and I knew what happened to him... he had japanese shit all over his house and 20 years later i decided to take him Japan. He begged to go back but i left that bitch... jk i took him back to the usa
My favorite Anime is peppe
My favorite anime is Office 4 play iv
rakenga up your ass
I'm so done
6,398 weaboos just wet their pants

Practise hygiene you crustys; no one likes stinkers and it's common curtesy. If done very well you might just hijack someone's nasal pov. and maybe even their heart.
I have an anime prof. picture but I'm perfectly fine with people hating anime. Just stating my opinion, have a wonderdul day comrades!
scrumdidilyumpsious
I have a katana and I watch anime but the two are completely unrelated. My grandpa gave me the katana he got as a gift, and I got into anime from my friends
my favorite anime is cancer i watch ti crawl across my skin as it consumes the world person by person. watching this cancer gave me cancer on my tumors
He's 52!? he looks more like hes in his 30's
Japanese people are stupid stuck up assholes that think they have to be perfect fucks in public. They act almost like robots not human beings. Their OBSESSED with perfection. I agree with the rest of his video but not the beginning. Then watch tentacle porn later because a guys penis is for bidden to be seen but a tentacle up a vagina üòï which is totally not un natural by the way. Is obscene.  I respect that they have integrity but their worse then the British!
Nani the fuck did you just fucking iimasu about watashi, you chiisai bitch desuka? Watashi‚Äôll have anata know that watashi graduated top of my class in Nihongo 3, and watashi‚Äôve been involved in iroirona Nihongo tutoring sessions, and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores. Watashi am trained in kanji, and watashi is the top letter writer in all of southern California. Anata are nothing to watashi but just another weaboo. Watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has never been mimasu‚Äôd before on this continent, mark watashino fucking words. Anata thinks anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto? Omou again, fucker. As we hanashimasu, watashi am contacting watashino secret netto of otakus across the USA, and anatano IP is being traced right now so you better junbishimasu for the ame, ujimushi. The ame that korosu‚Äôs the pathetic chiisai thing anata calls anatano life. You‚Äôre fucking shinimashita‚Äôd, akachan.

Hey. You should not let society decide for you what is right and wrong. Do not let society weight you down. I bet you guys would not talk about gay people like this. Everybody is equal, whether your weeaboo, gay, straight, man or woman. You shouldn't let society weigh you down. Be who you want to be. Your job is not about pleasing society, instead, it's about pleasing yourself, doing what makes you happy. Don't deny your true self anymore. Don't push others down, rather, lift them up.
This Is The Funniest Thing I Have Watched In A While, Keep it Up
The best video i ever saw xDD
Fucking hell dude, clear your throat, it sounds like you're gargling dick.
You know what? I hope you have a psychotic rapist kidnap you and be raped in his rape hole. Then get your arms cut off by a plastic 30cm ruler. Then have your arms stabbed with razor blades sticking out of them while getting you forced to eat them while someone is punching you in the chin so you bite hard on the razors. Then get skinned from the hips to the underneath of your bleeding arms then have the skin tied around your head so your still half alive but choking and suffocating on your cut-off-arm blood. Someone then pours a bath load of petrol on you and lights you on fire until you stop squirming or if the fire burns out, which ever comes first. Then have your nearly lifeless and useless body hung by electric barbed wire until you die then get five, hungry wolves that haven't been fed in three days to eat you, then burn their shit with your particles in it. Then throw the ashes into a volcano. Also I bet you were a failed abortion. I wish, when you were in your mothers stomach as a fetus, your head was a little too close to your mums vajina then your father came and raped her in the pussy til she bled. But it turns out it wasn't her pussy that was bleeding, it was your tiny ugly fetus head getting smacked by your dads penis. [That's why they called you, "fucked in the head"]. Then when your dad was finished with your cum filled bitchy whore of a mother, he bit a hole out of your mums stomach and pulled you out, and let your mum bleed out and die in pain and misery. Your dad then ripped out your umbilical cord to shove on his cock and started licking your tiny mouth because your vajina wasn't formed properly yet. Then when your dad was finished with you he chucked you in the toilet with out flushing so you rot over time then your dad died of the rotting stench of you and your mum so he rotted as well. Well wishing isn't gonna help anything. You might as well go drink bleach to ease off the pain of this comment. Suck it.
I didnt notice that the speed is 1.25 and I was like "WTF WHY IS HE SPEAK SO FAST" ?!
Your so cute frank XX

So I'm Japanese but I'm mixed with so many other races. I lived in Japan when I was 6-7 :D it was really cool and I love the food and candy. I try to learn Japanese but I end up pronouncing words wrong, using wrong pronouns, and stuff. I used to think desu meant "I am" but i think it means "it is" I'm not really sure. Anyone know good websites to learn Japanese?
Is Filthy Frank Japanese

Apparently "we have to run" sounds similar to "I like pussy"
my friends call me a weaboo and I don't even act like it and I'm not I just think Japans a cool place it's a lot different from the us

A Weeaboo goes to japan. He is greeted by a nice japanese woman who says "Hello and welcome to japan". He replies, "Dammit, I got the dub."
Anime sucks

I'm cringing to to the  fact that well....that's all true about weeaboos
Yeh I like anime but I'm not a fukin weaboo
Lmao ad I got was for some weeb game called girls x battle
This is the first Filthy Frank video I've ever watched. I'm 14 seconds in and I'm scared.
Hey bawse.
yes
I wanna roast a weeaboo, anyone know where to find them?
I like anime. It's art style is very appealing. They have very interesting stories and characters. I have a few mangas. A wooden sword of a weapon from an anime because it just looks cool. And a small plushy. But I do not denounce my culture. I literally have American in my blood and I believe in AMERICAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!! 
(Clears throat) I just like anime and video games. I'm not a Weaboo.
i used to be a weeb, but i went to rehab, and now i jsut like anime and speak japanese
hey weebs, y dont u fucking kill la kill yourself.
Jesus this video really did bring the worst of the fans in. All I see in the comments are people with anime pfps being either:
-self aware ("I em tresh xd" shit)
-triggered because he made fun of them
-doing the high and mighty shit saying "oh wow everyone here is a fucking child" while using an anime pfp, and proceed to take jokes way too serious.

I don't think I ever want to read the comments ever again on here.
anime
I was
i have no idea what rosetta stone is
People sprout bull shit like how Jason is scary, faggots do you know what it is like to realise weeaboo Jones could be walking towards your home at night? do you even?
You need a snapchat.... unless you have one frank, plz tell me if you do...
Is it a red flag if I collect guns to hunt?
/a/ btfo
he should talk instead of using this fake irritating screaming voice
Remember when it was okay for British people like me to enjoy anime just for the hell of it?

Pepperidge farm remembers.

Everyone makes fun of me now for liking Doctor Who, I mean come on it's a good anime...
My favorite anime is Donald Trump
attack on titan sux
As part Japanese and having studied ancient Japan (though I don't know the language), when Frank said the part about weeaboos praising the most xenophobic nation out there was hilarious. Oh, PS, my dad (full Japanese) hates anime and says it's the bad part of Japan that every American seems to like for some reason. Stay away from anime.
Back in my day, Chinese Ching chong cartoons were called anime, not this weaboo shit
Can you please a whole video where you speak purely Japanese?
I showed this to my 8 year old sister who loves anime just to warn her
I like to buy guns
Your always be a train engine to me
I dont even understand why people buy samurai swords or katanas... Like, if you're buying a weapon on the premise that you want to defend yourself 1) get a gun (if you can in your country) or 2) get a normal ass weapon (i for example have a small hatchet). 2nd point is that these weapons are either 1) cheap and useless or 2) VERY expensive and high quality (which I suppose would be the premise of buying one to just have it as a heirloom not to use it). Thirdly, if you're gonna buy a samurai sword to train with it, that shit is going to take time, not use it 6-7 times and then hang it on the wall. Fucking samurais practice years and years in order to make the weapon part of their body. Its literary a part of them in the hands of an expert, which I presume that the reasonable person doesn't have that time ...
is this guy mentally challenged?
I'm not a fan of anime but I like watching them... Also, I just found out that one of my friend is a weeaboo >:( finally! I thought I'm the only one who's getting irritated üòÇ she always says "sugoi" whenever she likes something but actually doesn't know any anime shows :P
Well fuck... my avatar is a fluff anime ball thing. 
Oh wait, I work two jobs, live in my own shitty house, love my own culture, knew if I went to Japan I couldn't read shit and thinks katanas are the most overrated sword in existence (which they fucking are! Get a decent axe or Zweih√§nder if you want weapons, you weeb scrubs)!

Fuck! Damn weeaboo's... don't even want anything else to do with Japan anymore. You're that bad you've turned me off a different point of view... Fuck!
Look seriously. To all the people asking if you're a weeb or something like that.
Being a weeaboo means you worship Japan and thinking it's superior to all other cultures. It means wishing to be Japanese.
If you don't believe or desperately want that you're not a weeaboo no matter how much anime you've watched, or manga you've read. That's it. It's not a meaningless buzz word to mean anime fan despite how some people use whether it be by trolling, ironically or ignorantly.
And the Filthy Frank channel is an absolutely horrible place to ask serious questions due to the fanbase being filled with people that troll in the some of the most repetitively, boring ways possible and ignorant bigots that spew insults in some of the most repetitively, boring ways possible.
so many weeaboos in my school
Lost it at "haro my namo isa cowboy tanaka"

Honestly I don't think its fair to judge everyone  only  because you saw a couple of videos with the worst most extreme weeaboos ever. Every group has its bad apples. Other groups have disgusting people too.
Ahem 0:06 he has two people in his closet. they are both dead üòÖüòÖ
Fuck anime
anime is shit




oh fuck
I'm so Cancerous.

6363 disliking this video are weeaboos haha :D
IN MY SCHOOL WEEABOOS ARE EVERY WHERE  HELP ME
How can people believe weeaboos are a massive thing? There's barely any dislikes. There's barely any dislikes on similar vids. 
Yeah, there's some ridiculously cringey people but isn't nearly as big as some thing think it is.
Seems like a weaboo
here's a lost comment
I dunno..  I think id smash the big girl a 9:45...  kusooo
i wanted to be goku, but im still hoping i will be a sayjan of my dreams
6:29
I like how he says "I love pussy, haha!" and the caption says "We have to run!"
all the anime you listed aren't actual anime. Even saying dragon ball z would've worked.
Is mayonnaise an anime?
This is officially the best Filthy Frank episode EVER
Groovy videos.
Could wee about jones be fake-frank
My first filthy frank vid, i had to stuff my mouth with my cover to not laugh loud af (10/10)
1:49 
Can someone please enlighten me on what he meant by a body pillow standing on it's on due to excessive sex? what's the joke here?
at 6:19 you should notify your school
if you watch filthy Frank the you should notify your school
Don't worry bud I've always wanted to be Thomas the tank engine to
I'm literally crying
this is why I don't want weeabos in Cali
preach!!!
Why does the guy at 9:56 look like PBG lol
I like how he uses the hand motions (like trump XD)
Did you just call me a weeb? I'll have you know I learned 5 words from watching anime. I graduated top of my neckbeard class. I can sweat in 20 different ways and that's just with my breasts. I could go to japan and make a living. You couldn't even distinguish the difference between naruto and death note. You're just another kawaii waifu desu in my way and I'm not afraid to dispose of you with my real life katana.
when he speaks Japanese, it sounds so satisfying...
DID U SAY NARUTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
my favorite anime was pawn stars

You know you're weeb if you say japanese words in English sentences. Now I read mangas and watch anime every once in a while but I don't say dumbass things like Kawaii or Desu that's just annoying like we live in America save that shit for your body pillow weeb. You're also a weeb if you go to the conventions
"Hello, my name is cowboy tanaka"
GUYS HALP I NEED ADVICE SINCE MY FRIENDS ARE WEEABOOS! (;3;) .....They speak Japanese incorrectly..they say they are Japanese because they watch a bunch of anime with me (yes we have Friday nights watching anime because....I like watching them on Fridays :3) so...they also state that they know how to draw anime and use chopsticks....when it's the opposite...and whenever I touch on the subject about them not actually being Japanese...they just literally all gang up on me and agree to each other that they are all Japanese beaded on those facts....and I don't know what to do now...like I don't want to lose them as friends...but at the same time I cringe at the thought of those statements....any advice guys..?
Holy shit that perfect Japanese tho
I'm an Anime fan, and I still think this is a work of art hahahahaha
LOL I saw a few weeaboos dressed up in full naruto gear at the fucking mall! They looked like they were in the early 20's too.... didn't know there was a name for them lol

In the USA kids don't watch DragonBall??
if I was that pigeon I would stay. just annoy the hell out of him
he's not really 52 is he.
Please be a voice actor.
I prefer 1000000 times more to be a an otaku (I'm not because for misfortunes of the universe I stay almost all the day out of my house) than a fucking retard who pays for put shit in his body, for example: alcohol drink,drugs, smoke... So yeah, almost all of you are a disgrace kind of humans, you are not cool, you are just retards. And let's not talk about swaggers and chavs the most disgusting and abnormals of all the humans., and weaboos aswell are a fucking retards cunts.  But, I'm not a hater, I'm just realisitc. All of the humanity sucks so hard.
Even though i have an anime profile picture i definitely am not a weeabo xD
shut the fuck up
The subs at  the start are definitely wrong

nice touch to what you actually said though

i love this vid
even though i watch a ton of anime
have a manga collection
basically very obsessed with japanese culture 

its probably because

i'm actually japanese unlike you disgusting weebs :^)
So irrelevant
Can Japanese people be weaboo's?
Weeaboo jones is imposter frank im calling it

SHUT THE FUCK UP
My god he sounds EXACTLY LIKE A WEEABOO! I love it!!
his voice makes my throat hurt is he ok?
i fucking love how he describes Japanese people as xenophobic throwing reality checks all over the place
At the beginning he sounds like one of those serious-looking highly successful asian men walking down tokyo or seoul in a suit...and then you realize...can EVERY serious looking asian executive in tokyo or seoul do the filthy frank voice???
my favorite anime is harambe
alright so I've watched anime like 3 times and i want to travel to japan (i wanna travel other places too but japan is number 1) I'm currently learning Japanese at my college in preparation to go to japan and my friend gifted me a 3 piece set of katanas, am I a weeaboo? Because I really don't want to be one
Anime is just Japanese porn
OMG WTF FILTHY FRANK PROBABLY WATCHES SOO MUCH ANIME üòÇ or he's amazing at impersonation
Sad truth for weaaboos lol

It is scrum diddly umptious
Even though this entire video is a joke I will say this, Papa Franku speaks Weeaboo (Japanese) in an extremely well way
cory in the house is the best anime
All the weeaboos need to be brought to labor camps and gassed

1:57
This comment section is full of edgy Filthy Frank cocksuckers who strive on dead memes and call anyone who likes anime weeaboos while saying the most generic and cringeworthy shit. Not much better than the weeaboos tbh.
9:58 Austin/ PBG?! What are you doing here kiddo?
I like anime, I'm just not a weeb :^)
I counted 5 Voice Cracks.
A little bit of Senpai in my life

If someone wants to be a weeabo let them you can't really stop it I mean not that it shouldn't be talked about it should its alarming but my thing is his is it offensive I mean like your statement a Asian guy just wears a cowboy outfit and hat and tries to be something he's not I wouldn't give a fuck about probably not even notice it helps them learn who they really are but if your a white guy doing all that weird shit like dressing up like an anime character stop you can take interest into Japanese culture and clothing without complete misinterpretation lol
I never seen a Japanese guy make me laugh before

Anime is cool, I want to learn Japanese, I count as a Weaboo, right? Most likely, at least I have a life, unlike this guy. Who tries to act funny and then acts like an idiot, some of his videos are good, however this one, I do not like.

2. I have a vast collection of katanas and I could kill you with one swipe. as I have trained everyday for 3 hours a day  (yes I trained myself) 

3. I have many body pillows of my favourite anime characters, both male and female. they are the only friends I have!!!! so don't you are talk shit about body pillows!

4. Last but least none of the above is true. I fucking hate weeaboos! They go around in thier groups looking down on none weeaboos thinking that people actually respect them.

What he is saying in Japanese in the beginning is most definitely not what those subtitles say. I'm just sure of it. Probably saying some shit like "Kill yourself, faggots. I hate all of you, but you don't know this because you're all dumb Americans and don't know Japanese

Somebody touch me pls
My favorite anime is when you have a beaner tied up in the basement and you're slowly fisting him with pig greas3 and hot Cheetos with cheese running down your hard cock, slowly liking evry cheese filled dark place and you are listening to jenny rivera and sticking your cock in a mango, then your mom walks in and says your moving with grandma because nobody loves you so you slit your balls and starting trying to jam a copy of Turbo Jam up your hairy ass, then your grandma says that she is a reptilian then the CIA comes and anal probes you with a mic that Yeezy used #onelove

firstly as an otaku (NOT a weeaboo check ut definitions) firstly how dare u insult shingeki no titan it is a modern day masterpiece to be compared with reservoir dogs and other tarantino films like lord of the rings. thirdly theres nothing wrong with pretending to have sharingen and just fyi running with ur arms behind u does make u go faster. It's been scientifically proven. Also I have a strong knowledge of Japanese culture (I know Japan well) I can speak fluent hiragana and mastered all the jutsu hand signs. I have a katana collection because of my respect for the culture and ud better watch out if u ever say anything bad about anime again.

This is honestly a pretty senseful video.I collect knives but just display them, which I guess is different.
I'm late to the party but this is gold. The speaking in Japanese topped it off for me.
I'm surprised that Papa Franku hasn't made a rant video on Bronies
9:19 even in real life sasuke gets all of da poosie boss
The Japanese are dogs who refuse to apologize for their atrocities and nanking...

Lol
Lol
shorbie

0:10 He actually said "I have 2 captives in my closet. Both of them are dead." xD

Why would you say you're Japanese if you're not Japanese? people like that annoy me, and Otakus and Weeaboos are two different things i don't get why some people are getting angry (unless you're a Weeaboos!)  people should realize that you can't change your race im a future animation artist and i respect the hard work that goes into anime and cartoons im obsessed with the art styles because there is always a new art style and story and it inspires me to want to draw more since i want to draw until my fingers fall off anyways

Weeaboo Jones, more like Constipated Ostrich
Its funny when people calling me a weeb, when really I see myself as an "anime enthusiast". Plus wanting to learn Japanese is cringe 


Imagine dressing up as a train LOL
I'm not that much of an anime fan. But I do watch English dubbed anime like Steins;Gate, and Attack On Titan. 

But I also watch other stuff like South Park and Torchwood just so I can avoid being a weeaboo. 

I like anime. Just not too much.

"Am I a weeb if __?"
Look as long as you don't think you're Japanese when you're not or you don't even embrace your own culture and only fucking absorb yourself with anime, body pillows, 170-something manga books, everything Japanese shit, trying to sound Japanese and getting it wrong, no.
Look. I'm Japanese. But I had a weeb phase in high school. Thought Japan was the best fuckin country and spent all my free time watching anime. The reason I began to draw is because I wanted to fucking make my own manga.
Now I draw pretty much anything but anime.
But you can enjoy anime or Japanese culture all you want. Just don't go fucking overboard.
But if you do, don't harass people online for calling you a weeb because it's exactly what you've become.
I'm not gonna lie wish I subscribed to this guy earlier :D
There was a weeaboo club at my high school and I didn't join it if any of you think that

"They have anim√© profile pictures!" ._.
Put on subtitles at 4:10
most of the weeabos ik are white people and even on YouTube they are white people
anyone else searching for angry weeaboos in the comment section ?
The only reason my profile pic is anime is because I love Pokemon. I still love you Papa Franku üòÑ
So if I go to Japan is everyone going to be an asshole to me? I get flight benefits and fly for free, Japan was on my list of places I wanted to go but I mean if everyone there's xenophobic then I don't know

Shrek is best anime.
FilthyFrank is my favorite anime
Sorry dad.
Anime is boring
thus is so fucking funny I almost got caught while I was sneaking it at night
fuck the weebs
I'm honestly shocked by the hate comments. They probably just read the title, went out of their way to post a hate comment on this video, and then return to their sword art online body pillow sex session. I'm gonna be honest when I say that I like a good anime every once in a while, but I can't stand the anime community. Just my opinion on the subject.
why fear the zombie apocalypse, if it's already happened.
Pretty funny how he trolls his introduction and messes up the subtitles. What he actually says is, "Welcome everyone. Welcome to the Filthy Frank Show. Today I have something amazing to tell you. I have two Jews held captive in my closet. They both are already dead."

smh
I like katanas, the're cool and kill zombies
Cutie ruined attack on titan for me.

Those bastards who always say the word "KAWAII" instead if "cute" while speaking fucking english with people who don't give a shit about anime.
lol you @lovelyraetheyoutuber
AGREED 100%
what is the 6:44 music
A Salamander Man & Pink Guy hentai would be pretty nice.
3:31. That is a oodama rasengan!
i don't have an anime avatar though...
I hate that my brother calls me a weeaboo, because he uses it incorrectly, he thinks that if you watch anime, he will call you a weeaboo
He sounds like pewdiepie üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I love it when he laughs at his own jokes and tries to block it off
wait, is salamander man acquainted with the British national anthem!?
Don't let your memes be dreams.
I fucking love frank xD
It's weird. I have a cousin who is a weeaboo, but is actually Korean. An Asian impersonating a different type of Asian is just awkward.

What's wrong with collecting weapons? Destruction is fun.
Umm? Should I feel bad about this? Nah, you got your opinion I got mine, this was funny as all get out, I am really kinda mad that you disliked people for what they like.... Ohh wait no I'm not, that's what this channels for, I consider me a fan of anime, I own a machete, but that's for camping. I guess I have some anime movies, I own dragon ball z on disc. I own Rosetta stone but its for school, and I want to go to Japan, but that's after some places in Europe (Ireland and Germany), and yea my Avatar is a anime character (Shiroe log horizon), but I don't know much about Japan, that's part of the reason why I want to go there, and this is a huge run on sentence ... wow... would I count as a partial/semi-weeaboo? Hmm, I just wasted a minute of my life reassuring myself that I'm not some weirdo, derp...

I love the part with the pigeon. üòê

that moment: when you realize that half your high school friends were borderline Weeaboo's.

If FilthyFrank is Japanese then weaboos definentally have no idea what Japan is like.
My favourite anime is icarly and jake and josh

You, my friend, have revived me from my internal death
This is all true that's sad
My friends have learned about weeaboo culture through this video but they got it all wrong. I started talking about a anime and they immediately call me a weeb. I don't even watch anime ever. What should I do? I want them to stop judging me incorrectly.
Percy's ass üëÖ
people who disliked this are like "I'M NOT A WEEABOO! I'M AN OTAKU! EVEN THOUGH I WATCH ANIME, HAVE A MANGA COLLECTION, ATTEND ANIME CONVENTIONS, AND SPEAK BROKEN JAPANESE DOESN'T MEAN I'M A WEEABOO!"
9:22 I actually no fucking joke cried because the cringe was so strong

Follow your dreams, son.
I just like this picture :3
Are you proud Frank? look at these people in the comment section obviously paying zero attention to what you said about anime lovers and weeaboos being separate.  Now anyone claiming to like anime gets bullied by the small minded twats who watch your videos. My friends almost isolated me just because I watch anime.
I dunno what anyone else says, but that girl who cosplays Misty is very beautiful
while i see anime i forget than i am very ugly
I prefer this than drugs
In the beginning he said he has two dying men in his closet..
Hey b0ss
The good old days when real franku san still made videos
I used to like you, but after watching this I am so fed up. You are an evil human being, I am more Japanese than you even though my dick is long. You are such a cunt, I would never be your nakama! Also you aren't a pedophile if you like loli hentai. Fuck YOU
I may love anime, manga, and the Japanese culture but I know that I'm Merican...... yeah Merica....... fuck yeah.

"Keep in mind that a non-Japanese person can like the culture, watch anime, speak the language and respect the culture, while still keeping in touch with their own."

The point that 0.01% of people remember and acknowledge üëèüèª

So is it possible for me to be a weeaboo when I am Japanese?
I get called a weeb daily, yet I've only seen one anime, and the accuser has watched many, but says it was "back when he was a weeb". My brother is a fucking bitch.
best anime is filtheyfrank

I know someone who's a weaboo and every time he talks about like anime or stuff related to Japan I just want to stab him
Jeez don't wanna sound mean but you're voice hurts my ear like dang
On the Day September, 5 ,2016, 6,133 Weeaboos Hate this video
Whilst living in Southeast Asia, I used to do 7 martial arts (rest assured, not all of them originated fro. Japan), and was also devotedly involved in the Japanese music/anime/manga/cosplaying community. I used to get odd/judgmental looks when discussing such things after moving to the UK, and I only then realised that being a, or just assumed to be a, 'weeaboo' (especially if one isn't half/fully Asian) usually consisted of cringe, like pronouncing Sakura as 'Sah-keuuuu-rahh' and brandishing fake copies of katanas while roleplaying with waifus in one's mother's basement. Currently, I'd rather admit to liking a bit of Suicide Silence and shit-tonnes of Abba, instead of admitting to pretty much being a weeaboo back I the day.That being said, may I cosplay as you, papa?
I like it when he speaks Japanese
Anime is just japans way of corrupting our youth as revenge for WWII
My favorite anime is Michael Rosen
The only anime I've ever watched is Initial D and i would fucking love to get a AE86 Toyota, does that classify as a weeaboo or just car guy?
I feel ya frank I wanted to be Thomas the tank engine too
0:09-0:15 if you listen closely he's actually saying something about killing and dying there lol
this is bordering on being an experimental film towards the end. :P
My favorite Anime is SpongeBob Squarepants.
Papa Fank
Dude frank roast the fnaf creeps
I'm just going to say it, Anime is gay
meh my youtube name and picture first started off as a joke but im lazy and dont wanna change it so meh
i love anime, and japanese culture, but i dont try to fit into it, i dont consider myself a Weeb but i definitely do love the culture,food, and anime. and i LOVED this video, literally had me laughing ALL day lol
I despise weeaboo as much as every other man, but because they're obnoxious and disgusting, but crying about it because of cultural appropriation makes you sound like a fucking beta leftist. Also, would be pretty awesome to see japanese people tape up their eyes, bleach their hair and learn lassoing.
My favourite anime is Opra
my favourite anime characters are:








Phineas
Ferb
Kim kardashian
Rick Harrison
Jason Bourne
and last but not least
mr moseby

I fucking lost it at "W-W-Weeaboo Jones!"

Did Safari Man just declare his hetero sexuality?
Wait, so hypothetically, if I had a sword collection that incorporated katanas, because I was history nerd, is it still disgusting?
That's a really awkward way to say welcome, Jesus.

One thing about anime
whats the anime at 10:19
I checked my Anime Planet today. I've watched 8months 5days and 2hours of anime in the past two years... anyone got a noose?

4:11 I set this to my ringtone for my retarded faggot weeb brother.
Cory in the House has no shit on my Bee Movie
Before you weeaboos start attacking Frank, Frank is actually half australian and japanese, which is one of the reasons he is able to speak japanese. While he is not entirely japanese, he sure is closer to being japanese than you.
I do like anime. there are plenty of great ones, but I can't stand the people who get the anime life size pillows and dress as characters when it's not for an event or Halloween. I'm in college and a few months ago I seen the most cringiest group of all time. one dude was wearing a fedora, one girl was wearing a tail and  had on furry tye dye fur boots with cat ear headphones, another guy had a tail on...all either wearing video game or anime shirts. I love both and want to talk to more people who do, but I always dread when they try to talk to me. I just want to talk to people who enjoy both games anime and go to their house from time to time to watch or play. That's it. When you start bringing tails and furry animal boots with cat ears out in public...nope.. I can't do that.
Personally, I love anime and I find this video hilarious.
"it doesn't make you Japanese, it just makes you a borderline pedophile" got me dying
Filthy Frank: WEABOOS ARE DISGUSTING
Also Filthy Frank: Acts like a goddamn animal in a skin tight pink costume.
I came here to see these hate comments¬† in caps
I like Anime..I'm not exactly a weeaboo but I have like 2 - 3 anime pictures in my room..two of one piece and 1 of guttsu from berserk..other then that that's pretty much it..I'm not exactly a Weeb..but I'm containing it and not making sure I become one..I even have a noose in my closet in case things get out of hand..Thanks Frank :) <3
weaboo jones looks like me walking to the bathroom when i need to take a shit
Your japanese is really good üò∞
i collect swords but not Japanese swords (while i do own one) it is for HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) and becuase longswords are sexy as fuck and look good on walls
W-where are the subtitles ? ,hahah funny
Fuck you filthyfrank anime is life. I own over 164 volumes of manga and have 20 posters up in my room, 32 action figures, and I can speak japanese pretty well (I've been practicing for a couple months). I'm not a "weeaboo". Just because I'm not Japanese I can still become a japanese person if I move to japan so your argument is invalid, also you're a weeaboo then because you were speaking japanese in the video and you have an anime wig you faker.
the Misty cosplay he showed during the weeaboo song was like, the exact opposite of a butterface
6,122 weeabos are pissed
What if Weeaboo Jones is Fake Frank. He looks like Frank and has sunglasses too.
Pay know attention to anime watchers....they think they can get some big ass jugs with colourful hair....this is fucking real life you cunts...your not a fucking anime character
7:44 THAT IS A TERRIFYING WALK (;¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂–î‡ºé‡∫∂`)

HelloGuys
My favourite anime is DramaAlert
whats the music used in the weabo protection chamber called ?
Even watching them cartons is a bit weird.
As a man who purposely made fanfiction characters who call out everyone else on their bullshit, I find this to be a very compelling argument...
Also my characters talk like Dante in DMC 4, as in he is passive aggressive and calls everyone "kid"
When he started to imitate the voice of Japanese girl.......... FUCK YOU,WHY ARE YOU SO GOOD!!!
weeaboo jones is actually kind of scary when he walks
papa Frank I'm turning into a weeaboo run please!

holy shit, this is monetized.
First Filthy Frank video, when he started speaking Japanese, I thought that was his main language / does his videos in them. That confused the hell out of me.
Why does filthy frank not sound like a fajit when he speaks like a jap?
Question: If you're trying to learn japanese are you a auto weeb? 
And you cant call them unhygienic when your name is filthy frank XD
fuck... ive only watched like 2 animes and i have 2 katanas cause they r kinda cool. never felt more ashamed over this in my life
boku no pico fan boy
You're the boss.
My favourite anime is The Holocaust.
I just feel like we should stick to our own culture and not jeopardize another. the japanese can be committed to loving anime and we americans can be committed to loving cartoons and comics and whatnot. it just feels like if we try to fit in a different culture, it makes us feel like we don't belong. I do watch anime but I respect my culture and not another culture I don't

I understand your pain filthy frank. I wanted to be a transformer
when he talks in his filthy frank voice he looks like he's 20, but when he starts talking in Japanese, he looks like he's 40. How fucking old is he?
i like anime, bUT IM NOT A FUCKING WEEABOO PLZ NO. THOSE PEOPLE ARE TERRIYING ;0; THEY RANT SO MUCH....SO SO MUCH.... crys
I'm probably going to get a lot of backlash for saying this, but isn't the "[Insert non-Anime title here] is my favorite anime!" meme getting old now? I mean it was funny when it was new, but now it's just busy growing a gray beard.
Why is his room so messy
I fucking hate weeaboos also. I like bleach but u don't see me dressing up like fucking aizen. All u weeaboos can go guck off bc u know franks right. And hey I love Seinfeld, that's Is one of my fav animes

Me:I want to go to japan, and- 
Others:YOU FUKIN WEEB I BET YOU HAVE SEX WITH YOUR BODY PILLOW< WATCH ANIME< AND JACK IT TO HENTAI, YOU DEGENERATE CLOD!
Me: Well fine sir who must have attention, you never let me finish, I was about to say, and To Italy and France one day...... Ass.
Should I be ashamed that when he was saying that "not all Japanese people should like this", I actually knew what he was saying with all of them... I'm not a seen I promise
my favorite one piece crewman is Ash Ketchum, his best buddy Agumon is awesome when he uses his Moon Crystal to turn Ssj and his chakra spikes causing his Shinigami demon to go back in time to find the Tetsaga sword to collect all the pieces of the philosopher's stone to resurrect his parents with alchemy....

Some black kid got mad at me for wearing a vaporwave shirt with Japanese on it, ironically keep in mind, because I don't speak Japanese (the only Japanese I know is from the Japanese 101s). He came to school the next day in a Tokyo Ghoul shirt. I died of laughter in the middle of the hall.

Actual serious question: Why aren't there terms for people who want to be of other cultures of their own (For example I'm american, and I want to be... a-american. Okay bad example, but you get my point).
Cory in the house, I all most died
FUCK YOU ANIME IS THE BEST 




Jk fuck anime
what am I on right now

Anyone else taste eggs when you watch these vids?
who agrees Cory In the house is the best anime
Exthuse me, watch yur languetch.
ZLAYNIEGON called you the almighty filfthy frank a WEABOO
i used to collect knives
man, i admit that is not correct liking japan just because anime, because its just a point of a millenary country. (if we talk about all ages) but! if we talk about modern japan, anime and videogames are the special things (for people, not in my case) about japan, boy, you know that thanks to this types art, japan is gaining inconmensurable cuantities of money and popularity per day.
another thing is that, hell, not every anime fans are like this you know.
second point, people can feel what they want, if they feel japanese, and they love japan, you need to be proud of it... because your japanese,  every day i look your comment video¬¥s box and most of your fans are anime fans, most of your popularity is because when people know your japanese, they associate it to all manga and bla bla bla.
So, you need to thank to anime and this thinigs because if this types of art wouldnt exist, probably japan wouldnt be the second or third world power, because money and popularity. (and techonolgy)
Am I the only one that thinks that Frank is actually cute? vv
Harambe, Harambe I'm Glad he died, Harambe Harambe, it's time for the Lotion cam.

Anime Is Sh-




Weeaboos Im Sorry
I sexually Identify as an Weeaboo. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over Japan dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting bodypillows. People say to me that a person being a Weeaboo  is Impossible and I‚Äôm fucking retarded but I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm beautiful. I‚Äôm having a plastic surgeon install Boku no pico, 30 bodypillows and highschool dxd on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me ‚ÄúNaruto‚Äù and respect my right to kawaii from above and rape pillows needlessly. If you can‚Äôt accept me you‚Äôre a Weeaphobe and need to check your senpai privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.
wtf is a yuudaijin? I wonder if he meant Yuukai-jin, which I'm pretty sure is not a word but at least it would make sense. Two kidnapped persons are in his closet and he thinks they're both dead. If anyone caught that let me know. You can mail your comments to PO Box 6969, No one loves you Boulevard, Shin-Imamiya, Osaka-Fu, Jahpan.
lol
This Song at the end is the definition of the word "Chill" <3
Filthy Frank is such a great anime. I hope the the weeaboos don't ruin it.

I mean, I watch anime. But I am not to the point where I forget who I am.
Weeaboo is a derogatory term that is now used by everyone. If you like anime and you say it on some video or comment on some anime. Its instantly just slapped onto you. There are weeaboos in the world, but not every single human life form of the Galaxy we live on that watches Anime and just likes it is not a weeaboo. just like every word or saying. Vape Nation is just a derogatory term or comment just slapped on people who smoke or do nicotine when they only do it because why not. But then there are people who Vape like no tomorrow. Just like Minecraft, if you like mine craft. You're in a world of hate my friend, the community is bad, but the game is fine. Just like this consoles and pc wars, if you like a certain console, then like it. But then there are people out there that like to take a dump on your comment saying, " [This Console] is better!" Or "Pc Master race." 

Just liking something can get you into a life of hate.

to all weeaboos 
the subtitles are up your ass
So Does Watching Anime, Recpecting Japenese Culture, And Keeping Touch With My Own Make Me A Weaboo?
Like, when all the weeabitches complain about English voiceover and prefer the gender ambiguous Japanese voices. I don't understand why anyone would prefer reading.
my favorite animes are ICarly, Chowder, Minecraft, Roblox, and Australian anti bullying videos.
"rosetta stone"
Fuck Percy. It's all about Gordon!!! ;)
Anime is fucking gay bro BITE ME BITCH
My favorite anime is Boku no Pico.

4:10 What the fuck is he saying here?!
I cosplay as akatsuki members and watch anime is that a weeaboos
The weeaboo song is straight fire
I cringed during the whole video XD
üëèüëèüëè preach
6,041 weeaboos were here
shinsou no reijou tashi (bondage game)
These weeabos don't even know what's a ≈çdachi or a bastard sword... Since the ≈ådachi is a Japanese sword, might as well call it Katana, right? Oh since the Bastard sword is European, it's a claymore, right? Fucking weeabos are another pile of horseshit that sword enthusiasts have to deal with....
Frank speaking Japanese just hit no.1 on my proudest fap list.
A friendly reminder that Naruto Shippuden is a top tier anime.
Mental Sickness...
wow his Japanese is really good
are you an Otaku or a Weeaboo ?
I call myself a weaboo but I keep in touch with my culture. I just really like the Japanese culture c:
6:43 Franku if you're trying to get away from the Weeaboos why the hell would you go there?! You went to the one place that exists solely to insulate and protect weeaboos from all forms of criticism and reality. Or was that your plan the entire time? To destroy them from the inside?
Dude. What is going on?
I would like to collect ak 74 and other fire arms. Just the cash prob. I wanna lear how to fire accurate with a gun.
I think u need to clear your throat...
I like the anime, but at the same time I'm too lazy to learn Japanese and I'm happy and proud of being American. I also think the Japanese culture is very unique and interesting, and I want to look into it. To be honest the main reason I like anime is because the art style is very pleasing and pretty. The second is because the Japanese language is interesting, and also pleasing to listen to. Maybe I'll get to learning it someday as a second language because it'll be good for jobs and such, but then again, I'm lazy lol.
Scrumdidilyumptious
I would really like to see a weeaboo getting triggered over this video
pink guy in every Japanese event in my country (tunisia)
That song is lit
The katana is gay as shit
well shit now i feel bad for having anime posters....
Wait, if I'm non-Japanese, speak the language, respect the culture and love Japan, am I not a Japanophile?

He could actual voice an anime person
Looks like I'm apart of the weeaboo thing, despite me just liking anime and manga, I wouldn't really want to move to Japan.
I don't denounce my own culture, I'm more of an otaku, really. I just call myself a weeb as a joke. :'v

4:10 is an accurate representation of anime
Is it weird that understand every thing he said in Japanese when he said they don't talk like this
When i was just but a mere child, I wanted to be Maximus Decimus Meridius,  commander of the armies of the north, general of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and will have vengance, in this life, or the next.

I consider myself in between ;-;
Don't know Japanese, although I wouldn't mind trying to learn it
I love Anime and Manga - Though I don't have a wide variety of knowledge
I watch English Dub and English Sub - Sometimes I prefer Sub over Dub ;-;
I don't collect things though ;-; Would if I could, but it's not really something I see myself doing
I do have an interest for the Japanese culture, but I don't claim to know much ;-;
And Yeah. Not much of a weeaboo 
Though I won't deny 
Every occasional time when I'm in the shower I'll try to use a water style jutsu ;_;
Don't judge me please ;_;

I might be a weaboo. I mean, I want to visit Japan but only because I'm a history buff and I was always intrigued with Japan's history so I want to gor for the historical sights. I do own a weapon collection. I have got lucky and came upon a WW2 Japanese Arisaka type 99 bolt action rifle. As for blades, I'm actually practicing to become a blacksmith and honestly, through long periods of combat, Japanese steel wouldn't last, I prefer Filipino, or Nepalese, even China has great blades. Do I know Japanese? Nah. Would I learn the basics so I can talk to people when I'm there? Of course, I mean, same goes for any country. If you're going to Russia, you should know the basics of Russian. Do I think I'm Japanese? Nope, I'm Irish, Scottish and Native. Do I want to visit Japan simply for the anime? No, that's a waste of a trip. Like I said, historical parts first and maybe check out some anime shit. So am I a weeb? Not really sure. Oh well my dudes.
How do you feel about the Nanking Massacre and the Japanese failure to recognize it's occurrence? failure to reply means you are happy with what happened.
My favourite anime is Cory In The House. :3 :)
can someone translate what frank says in japanese?
This is the BEST anime ever!

R.I.P your neighbors
But Attack On Titan Is Pretty Good.....

You know, usually I'd actually feel a bit sorry for people like you but.. You're trying too hard, your content is not really funny.. You seem to me like yet another deft, mindless imbecile. This would have been funny if you were stating actual facts about what you call "weeaboos" but, it all came across as nothing but hate. You're, to put it simply.. a joke.

I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

Gomenasai, my name is Ken-Sama.

I‚Äôm a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)

I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.

I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%

Wish me luck in Japan!

Weeaboos are disrespectful, idiotic and thoughtless people. They're basically making fun of the culture itself and mocking Japanese.

Corey in the house is the GOAT
Ironically, I actually am partial to buying a sword or two later in life. It's not because of my like for anime, it's more of the fact that I like throwing knives and my teacher is telling me that I'm getting better at slicing and not just jabbing forward.
My favorite anime is spiderman.

Don't talk shit about attack on titan, it's a really good show!
7:03 had me laugh so hard. OH MY GODDD XD
For all the non Japanese speakers out there, in the first 15 seconds of the show he said:

Welcome to the filthy frank show. 
I want to tell you all a surprise.
I have two people in the closet.
Both of them are dead.

Your welcome.
okay, so,  i watch anime, and i enjoy drawing manga, but i have no swords, or posters(and i dont practice jutsus in the corner XD). The only anime merchandise i have is a key chain of a character i like. Does that make me a weeaboo or not?

http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/the-ten-commandments-of-why-anime-sucks.197919198/
Cory in the house is obviously the best anime ever
I'm socially inept with no sexual attraction, I turned to Japanese TV shows to escape my pitiful existence, I learned a few Japanese phrases and immediately assumed I'm fluent in the language and I think anime portrays modern Japanese culture and mannerisms exactly.


Does that make me a weeaboo? I honestly can't tell.
my favorite anime is Airplane!
My favorite anime is Red Room
not every weeb is bad...
watashi wa gender is a weeaboo and im offended desu
this has more views than really good songs on youtube. damn
filthy frank. .come to vegas
GURD dam weeaboos  Kawaii
Jontron is easily the most underrated anime.
Weeaboos who like attack on Titan, are the worst kind of weeaboos. That anime sucks.

THE PIGION "GET THE FUCK OUT" üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I'm cryingüòÇüòÇüòÇ
its mental problems that is causing it,not japan or anime,the human mind is usually wrong and flawed,mental problems are what causes weeaboos,a weeaboo is someone that thinks they are japanese and they pronounce japanese words wrong to make the japanese look foolish and use up their parents money to buy japanese stuff,watching anime and playing japanese games does not make you a weeaboo,disrespecting the culture and thinking you are japanese makes you one. Anime is like any other media,not all anime are cute and not all anime are porn/hentai,black lagoon is not cute and looks dark and gritty,weeaboos give anime a bad reputation and make anime look stupid,not all Anime focuses on japanese stuff,Not all anime is for children also and not all anime have sexualised characters,also not all anime have large eyed characters,weeaboos are the reason why anime haters exist,There are english dubbed anime, also Hentai pictures are confusing you into thinking all anime is just one thing,anime also have genres just like any other media,other media have cliches just as well,look at western cartoons,most of them are just funny now a days and most of them don't have a story,while most anime have a plot or story and there's a lot of them with stories unlike most modern western cartoons,underaged sexualisation of characters was also used in the rest of the world,not just japan,there is a lot of comedy anime,but some of them have a later story that wacks some sense into that comedy anime and will tell a deep plot,anime are not the only ones with messed up stuff,live action films that were totally not for kids can be very messed up like this film made in serbia called A Serbian Film.

Awkward Question: Have you watched Boku No Pico??
SHUT THE FUCK UP NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOUR ROBOT FANFICTIONS!
I like cosplay and roleplaying anime. But, I'm not Japanese and I don't speak it either. Anime keeps me from being bored. Does that mean I'm a weeaboo? P.s, if you're just going to tell me to kill myself, you can fuck off.
My favorite anime is the crusades
Big question.....i used a bit of this video to make a funny little meme Overwatch POTG and want to upload it to youtube......but i really dont want to get hit with a copyright? how would i avoid that....should i just link the part of the video to your channel or what

That song.... It's fucking beautiful.
Woah, my favourite anime is Cory in the house as well. What a coincidence.
i watch anime and am not a weeaboo (by definition), and let me just say one thing.... I THINK THIS VIDEO IS FUCKING HILARIOUS, there are people who take anime shit too far, and they put a bad name on people who may just like pokemon. I like your videos and think they are hilarious, and people who think they are "offensive" should stop bitching and just not watch them if they dont get this kind of humor.

My sister calls me a weeaboo. I hate it so much because, first of all, it's not a word. I hat when people use it. But the way he described it, "A non Japanese person who basically denounces their own culture and calls themselves Japanese. etc", I did try to learn Japanese through anime, I believe I respected the culture , and still did things and kept in touch with my own culture. According to this definition I am not a weeaboo. If my sistor, or anyone else would like to call me one then please use and actual word or describe what I am you illiterate, closed minded idiots.
i noticed that when weaboo jones was throwing the swords and shit there was conivers kunai from tf2
Teacher: Now what have you learned? Me: Weeaboos are fucking insane and crazy. Teacher: Correct!
I'm dead XD

My favorite anime is He-man and the Masters of the Universe.
Obviously, the best anime is The Avengers: Age of Ultron.
Actually...........I feel like YouTube sensation frank would be a good anime voice actor..........pfffff
I love anime so much, but I don't think that this video is offensive at all. It's just hilarious.
Quest for Camelot is the best hentai ever made.
My favorit  anime  is,
9/11
the holocaust 
islam
africans With ebola
face it, you're never gonna make it
does the Moomins animated count as a anime?
Y'know, most of these people in the comment section say they hate anime, but they also have anime icons, Hypocrites, anyone?
I honestly don't know why all these weebs are getting their katanas up their ass about this. I find it quite funny... breathes heavily
That fucking Cowboy Tanaka bit is gold. It helps even more that you look a bit like Naoki Tanaka from Gaki no Tsukai.
My favorite? Well? I do happen to like Isis Beheadings...
I hate you go fuck yourself cause you don't know nothing about anime and I bet you jerk off with your pistol grip head ass

My favorite anime is the original power rangers from the 90's. Nobody in my generation listens to real hentai. Just mainstream trash like Kim Kardashian.
yo who the fuck are you to be talking like if we have lived real life and are nothing like these bullshit steriotypes
There was an Asian Cowboy caricature in the WWE once before named: "Jimmy Wayne Yang" LMAO
If you have an anime profile picture, beware, typing a comment on frankus channel is like stepping on a minefield.
ALL OF YOU FUCKING BRAINDEAD MORONS OF THE INTERNET NEED TO LOOK AT THIS VIDEO. This video gives the ORIGINAL and CORRECT definition of the term " weaboo", so ALL of the people who LITERALLY call me and everyone else who has an anime-related profile who would do something as minuscule as MAKE A YOUTUBE COMMENT a " weeaboo ", you deserve to have your fucking face CURB STOMPED. ( <- Exaggeration for emphasis. ) Why? Not out of rage, not out of frustration, but out of a need to bring light to this situation and awful phenomenon. This social inaccuracy that has gone WAY too far. You're a literally BRAINDEAD MORON if you'll completely ignore the shred of a concrete definition this word has and will call someone a " weeb " just for commenting on a f.ucking video.
the Shawshank Redemption is the best yaoi
He stopped the vid because a bird!? What?
honestly anyone who watches an non mainstream anime with subtitles is a weeaboo, like i guess naruto or pokemon is fine but when it comes to subtitle anime that shit is too dumb
Anime is super aids
It's so funny. The only bad thing is that majority of images shows..well... not slim people. And some of them (for example this man dressed up like Inuyashia) were just cosplaying or simply showing their cosplay. I don't see nothing wrong with that. I have lots of manga but I am not a weeboo, I just enjoy reading them :) Also, I don't think having an anime avatar is bad.. of course as long as they don't try to act like them. It's just my opinion :) I am not arguing so don't worry xD
i hate anime
no joke
"cowboy tanaka" XD
if u see a weeaboo in public try your best to humiliate them
My favorite anime is Halo 5: Guardians' cutscenes
So America and Japan are like the two most xenophobic countries in the world, yet they're strangely obsessed with one another...

Why would anyone want to move to Japan? I get invited by my Japanese cousins and Grandmother to go, but I know it's gunna fucking suck to go there and not know more than how to say select phrases. And if any of you out there are Japanese like me, you know obƒÅchan is going to wander off with her hands behind her back (slightly hunched) and leave you for dead in the middle of an unfamiliar place.
The best anime is Bee Movie.

Actually weeaboo and non-weeaboo line pretty fucked these days.
him making videos that is cx
The sad thing is that I actually like this channel, but his fanbase is retarded. Just because he makes a joke video doesn't mean you should make fun of people and tell them to "kill yourself." Seriously, all you assholes going around calling people a weeaboo and talking shit can fuck off. I've seen a YouTuber get bullied by a load of Filthy Frank fanboys, but Filthy Frank himself isn't being a dick like you all are. Seriously, I actually laughed watching almost all of Filthy Frank's videos(except ones like Vomit Cakeüò¢). I even wish that the anime opening was his real opening. That was hilarious. Again, stop acting all superior because I bet every single one of you is irritating in their own way.
Is he Japanese himself or does he just speak Japanese?

I like Anime but this is freakin' funny hahaha There is nothing wrong collecting these mangas or figures but how one should act should be considered. I don't really know why some take it to the extent. I definitely want a sword. I want a library of manga and would love to have a collection of my favorite anime but would I run around the world proclaiming i'm japanese even though I am not? NO. It's like being Vegan or  being in a religion. You should not shove it to others. Don't need to hide it just be normal.
do furries next, I'm a furry
This video never gets old
Understand where he coming from, but.........how do people find this funny, he was just making 12 year old middle school jokes about Weaboos, we get they take it over board, but this video was just annoying and frankly hard to watch, and what's with that annoying voice he doing, that shit is annoying asf, like if that's his natural voice that shit is cringy as hell

Nah, I identify as a weeaboo and I don't need anyone to tell me how I can fit within the mold. I totally enjoy fresh Mochi for its boobie texture and Kim chi because it goes with other good well. I'm living the weeb trash japanophile lifestyle and I'm a terrible terrible Mexican, albeit I'm not Mexican. That makes me a weeaboo!
anime is just a guilty pleasure of mine.

emphasis on "pleasure."

...
No lie the weeaboo song is really good who's the singer he's killing it
"Today I will teach you something good. There are two Jews inside my closet. They're both dead."

Why do all weeaboo look like the love child of grease and anime...
I kept getting an ad for Naruto online throughout this video
This is probably the best FilthyFrank video. Why? It has most of the things that the fans love: politically incorrect opinions about matters that will make a lot of people angry, dark humor, beloved characters like Frank, Salamander Man, Safari Guy and of course Pink guy, a final "fight" with effects that are bad on purpose, and a song written by Frank. What else can you ask for?
I miss this from filthy :(
will you ve my dad?
This guy speaks the truth.
He started playing the flute with his nose and I blew snot into my Pepsi
Weebs ruin the whole anime community. Like, I can't even watch all 11 seasons of Bones without being called weeb trash.
I want to meet that pigeon..

I'm eating Raman while watching this
Lol watching this in public... Bad idea
My favorite anime is dropkicking baby seals.
I love anime, but I'm not a weeaboo. anime is awesome ‚òï‚òï
Just realized I have an anime profile pic, am I a weeb?
If this guy thinks you are weird then just imagine how weird you are.
Wait wait wait, did frank say he's 52?!? 10:59
Dude anime sucks ass you god damm weaboos
Weeaboos ruin anime like how FNAF fankids ruin FNAF itself
all the weeaboos that insist on playing hanzo and and genji in overwatch  on ranked regardless of map or team comp make me feel dead inside....

I lost count of how many time I watched this video.
thoughts on weapon collections: weaboos should only have swords if they can smith them with fire and steel themselves
frank frazetta, the original filthy frank. he could sure draw tits. anime never thrilled me like it thrillsmy peers but i give them props on detail, and their stories are complex, but many of the male characters aren't manly, and the women seem to be lacking
wtf am I watching? XD this is brilliant!
These things are stupid but don't get me wrong this shit is funny as hell
Let the "weeb" spam begin!
For some reason this reminds me of Rick and morty
the best place to find loser weaboos is google+
At 2:07 u look like that kid at my school who is REALLY ANNOYING like once my teacher made us watch a youtube video about like the world and stuff and then when she left the class my friend told me to dislike the video on her computer so I did and that annoying kid saw me and he said "WHY DID U DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET A REFERRAL YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSE TO DO THAT!!!" And the worst thing is that he is supposed to be the smartest in the whole class and even my whole entire FUCKING GRADE! Like the fuck
gasp
FRANKU CHAN! I LOVE THE ANIME CORY IN THE HOUSE TOO!
My favorite anime is "Bill Nye the Science Guy"
This needs to stop fuck these phsychos and their fuckin anime
8:45 Its time to trow up
Yeah the anime fandom is like a battle ground and when you are not fighting or fleeing for your life, you are stepping over a minefield of SAO fans and intense Fangirls. I can't imagine what that shit looks like from the out side, don't worry it can be an amazing fandom just keep all your opinions about Naruto and basically all anime to your self  0-0

Remember if you see a weeaboo coming your way, don't try to reason with it, kill it and throw its body over a cliff.
Screw you weeaboos I'm a pure blooded Irishman.
....What??

This channel has at least pissed off at least 2 people
That awkward moment when you know Japanese and realize the subtitles at the beginning do not match what he says.
When he said I've been fucking my body pillow so much it stands on its own I died
I prefer wonder pets as the best anime.

eY b0s$
Yea animes stupid i like Japanese cartoons better
My favorite nightcore song is My Shiny Teeth And Me by Chip Skylark.
Yes, why of course. I wish I could have a rapier collection. I assume I am a renaissanceboo then, as anime's got nothing to do with my obsession for fencing weapons. Who needs a katana anyway though? My knowledge of anime is really poor, but I am not aware of a true rapier dueling anime to exist to this day. In a way, it could be the anime I would become a very minor weeaboo for, but nothing else. Also, don't ever mention Sword Art Online to me, that does not count as a renaissance anime at all, and my memory doesn't serve well if that female character even used it correctly. Though in one episode I could clearly hear 'reipia'. No one truly cares what people share on the internet anyway, so take this with a grain of salt, if you may. Thank you.
NOOOO NOT THE WEEABOOS!!
omg 4:11 he sounds just like natsu lmao
breathes really heavy and starts typing really fast don't u talk about my culture u fuck omg stfu u don't know anything!!11!11! 

I'm joking. This is true. I'm weeb but I don't take that shit too far.
Filthy frank taught me more about Weaboos than the Internet in a whole

"Weeaboos be in Japan like "Where the subtitles??"" - Filthy Frank
I have like 1 katana and that's only because I got it from my uncle. its a shitty stainless steel blade that can't even cut a water bottle tho to be honest.
holy fuck was that actual Japanese though? anyone who can speak multiple languages fluently is badass
This is what Hitler wanted to prevent. Hitler knew that one day the weeaboos would come, the first one to spread this disease had a jewish grandfather whom never got killed in the holocaust. Hitler did nothing wrong, he just wanted us to live happy lives, not plagued by the horrible disease we call weeabooism.
My favorite anime is my little pony
here is my list of favorite anime
1. Raven in da house
2. dats so Cory da movie

my favorite anime is girl meets world
Ok . so I'm a white guy and I wanna be Asian, cause we all know Asians are Fucking awesome.  but here's the thing. I look like the whitest heavy metal 90's kid. I don't act like a Fucking weeaboo. I've seen at least 200+ anime (most of them hentai), but I don't Fucking act them out and think I'm Japanese.  there's a HUGE difference between thinking anime is cool, wanting to be Asian, and being a Fucking WEEABOO. when you reach weeaboo level, at that point you should just hang yourself . #KYS.
plus hentai is love. hernia is life.
go hentai
My favorite anime is TVFilthyFrank

He smells, always want the upper hand in a word conflict, he is japan fanatic, 24/7 talking about animes, wants to be teacher in japan, thinks he is a master pro at Japanese. LIKE WTF M8.
My parents saw me watch this, it wasn't easy to explain.

Danny phantom is thebest ani ever
Weeb

Trying to convince people that they're weeaboos, should stop calling themselves "otakus" (because that's a heavy duty insult right there and just means overly obsessed,, like you could be a train otaku or some shit) and they really just need to stop

"I just wanted a piece of percies ass, ya know what I mean" -Filthy Frank 2014
Personally, I think one of the most annoying weeaboob things is when they like, "You guys don't know that much about anime. I'm smarter, I bet chu don't know what Kawaii means you idiots!!!11!!! KAWAIII DESU BISHES."
My favorite anime's are Twilight and Shrek.

Oh now I get it, People post on every single anime ever/forums that their favorite anime is cory in the house, Althought collecting weapons isn't as bad as you think, you can't use them or bring sharpened swords outside but it's more like you enjoy having a physical copy of it, like fapping to a picture isn't as satisfying as the irl version

I bet u all the dislikes are weaboos
The Shimazu katana carries the soul of the samoorai and can cut 20 trees in one slice, made of folded nippon steel and carries pommels that double as smoke grenades to stun before unleashing Sasuke chakra magic to wipe out platoons of western barbarians.

Wait... shit I use the Laughing Man symbol from ghost in the shell as my avatar all the time ... and of course from watching anime you do pick up some japanese words, but I don't think i've ever actually used that much of it for anything :/ Plus if I ever, god forbid, got the actual urge to cosplay I'd probably just go as.... wait no.. I'm definitely too lazy to ever do that.  Yay i'm not a weaboo! :D
Filthy Frank should be an anime¬†voice actor. Especially at 7:56.

My fav anime is die hard
fuck anime, my favourite manga is Mein Kampf
The only reason I wanna go to Japan is so I can actually get an understanding of the culture. And also because it is the source of the majority of my childhood. I played a lot of Pokemon as a child and still sometimes do today. But I don't try to be a Japanese person. I'm proud of my own culture. I also wanna go to places like Egypt, Greece, Mexico, and Italy.
My favourite anime is Bee Movie
"BORDERLAND PEDOPHILE" OMFG LOL

My favorite anime is Keeping Up With The Kardashians
In the millenia to come, people will study FilthyFrank as a encapsulation of the current modern trend of disassociation with what is seen as the "status quo". The continual reference to suicide is seen as a way out for individuals wanting a better time.
Triumph of the Will is clearly the best anime
surely frank is perfect for the role xD

If you haven't seen "My Son, The New Man of the House", you haven't seen real hentai and you're not even an otaku
I would pay to see a Japanese person go like this O_O, wear a cowboy hat and boots, swinging a lasso and going "YEEHAW"  That would be the greatest thing ever. I don't give a shit if it's offensive to either side, that'd be hilarious xD
Why collect swords when you could collect atomic bombs
I don't have a favourite anime, but if I had to choose one I had to watch, it'd be the Filthy Frank Show.

i love Yuri anime and manga. i don't care what people think. humans have free will to accept or decline culture. i decided to be Yuri lover. and besides, lesbianism is not only in Japan. if i think a culture is interesting, then i like it regardless where it comes from. i like Yukata, Kimono, Cheongsam (this is from China). i like cowboy hat. i like traditional music of ancient nations in Europe. i like some cool designs of architectures over the world.

I saw this dude who defended Japan on their dolphin hunting and said something along the lines of "you American pigs do the same thing to cows", pretty much comparing killing animals who were made to be in farms, to killing animals who were minding their own business only to get a harpoon though the spine and left for dead. Of fuckin' course he had a Naruto profile picture.

I would appreciate if you wouldn't be mean to people that like anime. Plus, you just have a total misconception about people who watch anime, and weeaboos.
Collecting weapons isn't an issue if you do it legally and responsibly e.g. do what me and friends do in collecting airsoft guns, some of my friends out in good old Murica have dozens of guns in their houses etcetera but doing it entirely for malicious purposes like a weeaboo degenerate would is as you say Frank, is the sort of red flag area that needs to be highlighted.
#destroytheweebs
Frank please help I need The Lord of knowledge of what makes a weeb and what doesn't I ask of you to simply tell me whom truly the weeb is the guy that has two anime collections prefers a nerf sword as his favored weapon posts song lyrics  he wrote on Facebook and his girlfriend is not only a weeb but I'm pretty fucking sure she's a soon to be furry While apparently I'm a weeb because I bought these Knifes http://www.walmart.com/ip/Mossy-Oak-Hunting-2-Knife-Giftset/23887128
of which I bought to resale anyways something. Must be done I am horribly offend to be called something that I've hated since I found out its a real thing

Bleach
My uncle just wants to learn Japanese NOT THROUGH ANIME, but he watches it.
This guy has a right to hate weeaboos, because they disrespect his nation.
Weeaboos for the 2016 Chin Chin  Sacrifices.
I fall into so many different kinds of categories that I've learnt to just not care if someone calls me a "Weeaboo" or a nerd or a geek or a filthy casual or whatever else. You guys say whatever you want. As long as someone is proud of who they are (or at least as long as they don't care about the insults), if making fun of people makes you happy, by all means, do it. Just make sure you do it in a hilarious way like this Frank guy.

I don't care if you made fun of something that I technically fall into the category of, this video was hilarious. It had me yelling "What in the actual fudge kind of drugs is this video made of?!" at times, but funny nonetheless. When you manage to get some of the people you're making fun of to laugh with you, you know you've succeeded at life. XD

EDIT: For the record, owning a Katana is not automatic weeaboo status. Some peopel just happen to think they're cool, or want to have them as decoration. Like me for instance. Sure I practice with it every so often when I get bored, but it's still mostly for decoration.

And yes. My name is in Japanese. No, it's not my real name. And no, that does not make someone a weeaboo instantly either, some people just think the written Japanese language looks better than English (which is simply an opinion.)
Oh wise PAPU FRANKU , please help me , my friend wants to make a YouTube  channel in ur image , however , it's a British school kid version. Please help me , what should i do ? Oh and I sexually identify as a lamp post

So it means "Thank you Lord, I'm not a weeaboo, so I'm saved!" I like the asian culture, I like anime, I enjoy their food, but still I don't hate my culture and specially the FOOD :9, the landscapes and the women of my country. But at least weeaboo try poorly to be japanese, at least they do some research, but for most what happens with my culture, everyone thinks we talk spanish or brazilian and Portugal only equals to Cristiano Ronaldo and nothing more is even worse than ur problems with weeaboos, at least everyone knows where's Japan in the Map, try with Portugal, lolol.

dude iits so akward when your beside your fammily XD watching this
Frank guy...or whomever you are...I agree that your quite funny but like this video some of your subjects can be quite disrespectful and ignorant. In your defensive you can't please everyone, but I at least hop your consider what your saying before you say them alongside how the effect others. On another note, I myself am a proud American but admire the japanese culture a great deal. I have artistic talent and hop to make a living of my aptitude which I draw inspiration from anime. Now you may think that what you defined a weeaboo to be is how people see it but it is most often used as an insult to otaku's [the american meaning for otaku] so I take offense to some of your statements, though with your personality im sure you dont care.
my favorite anime is jimmy neutron

is it bad that I looked thru the comments section to find people actually pissed about this video?
So true
Totally agree,¬† a lil anime is ok a lot is okay however when you kum on top of a body pillow of an anime character and jack off to Pikachu you are a disease.
I honestly really disagree with the message you are  trying to portray here. Many "weaboos" just have anime as a hobby and not much more. When you see cosplay it's not because they are taking it to an extreme they are just following their hobby. I for one really enjoy studying cosplay of various anime characters such as Hotaru Ichijo from Non Non Biyori¬†and many more. Also during the end when the " I'm a Weaboo " song was playing you said, "naruto is so overrated". Most people have this misconception that weaboos just hate on shows such as Naruto for no real apparent reason when there are valid reasons why. For example, Naruto has been in the spotlight for over a decade at this point while other underground Anime Series have had small viewer bases but deserve much more. Having a show like Naruto around pulls all the viewers toward that instead of other great shows. Also, it is very apparent that the quality of artwork in Naruto is lacking which is an obvious hint that the creators are just milking it for as long as possible. That is all I have to say and fyi I am not a weaboo I am just somebody that uses Anime it as an escape from reality since not many people understand me and what I like. Before I go I also want to say waifus are just pillows with beautiful art work that are only purchased to support the creator and to acknowledge the work that was put into the waifus. I hope now many of you understand the Anime fanbase and I hope the creator of this video understands the Anime Fanbase a bit better aswell.
Is game of thrones an anime?

If you want to go to Japan, then you should want to go to Japan because of Japan. Not go because Japanese.

Gomenasai, my name is Ken-Sama.

I‚Äôm a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)

I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.

I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%

When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!

I own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.

Wish me luck in Japan!

favorite anime is dragons ball peepee
5 thousand Serbs were offended on this day
I hate anime.
edups is edgier
See? Filthy Frank defines what a weeaboo is, but people still don't understand what it means. They think having anime pillows, shirts, profile pics, cosplaying,  etc. makes you a weeb.
He wanted heralds ass
god this guy is hilarious!!!
Shut the fuck up bitch ass nigga and your a dumbass asshold
Why is your voice so annoying I would love your videos but you sound like a smoker who is about to die. FeelsBadMan
1:57 le me
My favourite anime is definitely WWE Raw
how old is he?
is feeling quite offended since im half Japanese just saying there's also reverse weeaboos..... In Japan, there are people who want to be American or any other Ethnicity. I have no problem with that. But this is clearly taking it too far. I get that people try too hard to be like a Japanese person or an anime character, but in the end we're all human. This is like people hating Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, or Transgender people. I still have no problem with those people. I just so happen to know a few friends who are like that. Go ahead, call me whatever you want. I have stated my point.
do i count as a Weeaboo :D?
cedric is my favorite anime
frank should be a voice actor he could do like 3 different characters
they look like titans
"Make those baddies cry likean anime fan on prom night".

I'm 26 years old, have seen 70 anime titles and studying Japanese by myself. I feel like I'm Japanese. I want to get Japanese citizenship and became ethnically Japanese one day. Inshallah, I shall succeed. Why do you think it's something strange or cringeworthy to have a dream, Filthy Frank?

Go kill yourself u piece of shit you are gay and you use your pockets as ravioli bowls.....  You probably own a samurai sword collection.... And you are a faking American price of trash that has no resemblance to any Korean or Asian culture ... You have a dick the size of an ant and you have no balls... You should make fun of yourself ..... That way you would be getting more likes and subs because you are the worst faggot in the world... You live with the grinch and have to be paid to keep your cloths on in public....  You have a hobo holding your camera and you pay him in Monopoly money and rice

my favorite anime is bleach
I enjoy anime. Death Note, Owari No Seraph, Attack on Titan and i watched more of course. Its a good way to pass time xD. But i never understood fucking weeaboos. I dont understand the logic of throwing away your culture and deny that you are born in a specific ethnic group just to become Japanese. Its not even possible to become another race. "Shes trying to be black." "Hes trying to be Asian." "Oh god look at that white wannabe." Stupid asf.. God, no wonder a lot of Japanese people hate foreigners. Weeaboos are disgusting. (Koreaboos as well) They ruin anime for everyone
ey b0ss
Lets see how many weeaboos I can piss off: Avatar is the best anime, having a waifu/body-pillow is fucking stupid and anime is perverted
check out my cancer channel

So am I a weeaboo? I mean anime seems pretty awesome to me, :/  i've seen way to many series to count. XD Though I also like Homestuck, Doctor Who, Supernatural, Wander Over Yonder, OFF, Sonic, SU, Mario, etc. I have a few anime posters and some band posters too. I don't wanna learn Japanese because I'm never gonna go to Japan. It would be fucking pointless. XD Also I don't waste money on swords or blades. Only on guns and small pocket knives. (most of my money goes to paying bills and taxes) I think I'm not a weeaboo, but I'll leave that up to you guys. BTW Love ya FlithyFrank, your hilarious! <3

I like how Frank says "Anyimayh
Better watch out, someone could be breathing heavily.. but anyways, Anime Was A Mistake.
Someone should translate what he says
I've watched my fair share of chinese cartoons as a kid. it's always the same boring cliche characters, predictable plot and high school grills with huge tits. 

But then I saw the masterpiece that was Cory in the house

anime was a mistake except for Cory in the house

Hey i got anime pfp and im not a weeaboo doushebag
Does it make me a weeaboo if I had already tried to learn Japanese on Rosetta Stone so I could make fun of weeaboos in the language they're trying to learn?
Attack on weeaboos
Costanza-kun is my husbando
Does anyone wonder if anime girls were real, would they be disgusted as well from the weeaboos? I mean for me I would fucking laugh if it were true
Xenophobic? I can see why those people exist. Aliens are terrifying with their tongue mouths and their acid blood.
Turn on subtitles and enjoy the video. Trust me.

Anime is not cartoons, I am a cartoon fan and I cant get in to anime, they are very different.
is this where "cory in the house is an anime" started?
that japanese is sexy as fuck
fucka dem bitches with anime avatars. seriously. there are so many 12 year olds with anime avatars. even on this comment section.
He sounds like Korosensei with a deeper voice

Seriously, where is the weeaboo protection chamber? In an abandoned office building?!?
anime is pretty good
Weaboos should be put in concentration camps
"I need feminism to protect my anime culture!"
"You're SO IGNORANT you probably don't even know that the capital of Japan is Tosokagashi Village! I know because I identify as Japanese and animes like Boku no Pico taught me so."
Me: "The capital of Japan is Tokyo you fucking idiot"
Them: "OHMYGOD I WATCH ANIME ONLY I WOULD KNOW YOU IGNORANT PIECE OF KUSO! YOU PROBABLY DON'T EVEN KNOW ATTACK ON TITAN! THAT WAS BASED ON A TRUE STORY OHMYGOD!"
Me: "Yeah, my favorite anime was Godzilla: 1954, Cory in the House and South Park. LOL"
Them: "SHUT THE KUSO UP! YOU DISRESPECT ACTUAL JAPANESE CULTURE! AT LEAST I CARRY KATANAS AROUND LIKE THEY DO!"
Me: "Uhhhh, I hope you know they don't carry katanas around everywhere lol. . ."
Them: "YES THEY DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU WOULDNT KNOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T WATCH ANIME!!!!!!!!!"
Me: "ummmm you don't need to watch anime to know that they don't. . ."
Them: "YOU'RE SO IGNORANT IT MAKES ME CRINGE!!!!!! YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT JAPANESE CULTURE!!!!! YOU'RE SUCH A PIECE OF KUSO THAT MAKES ME CRINGE SO MUCH I NEED TO LEAVE OHMYGOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me: "And you're telling me that I make YOU cringe. . . Lol yes, please leave."
Them: "I'M GOING TO HUNT YOU DOWN WITH HAMAKU-SAN SOMEDAY WITH OUR NINJA POWERS AND YOU WILL SUFFER!!!!!!! I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU!!!!!!!!"
Me: "Lol alright, now please leave..."
Them: "NEVER FORGET!!!!!!!"
Me: "Fuck, I actually thought you'd leave. . ."

I love anime. But I think that people who own body pillows, collect katanas, or act like they're  "Kawaii" are hellbound.
How do u speak such good Japanese or what ever that shit was?
And the cowboy thing is actually ridiculously popular. My dad is a merchant marine, and when his ship was stationed in Hawaii, he and a couple of buddies of his walked into a bar, and it turns out it was a Japanese cowboy bar.

As a Japanese American, there's nothing I hate more than those weeaboo pussies.
God, I hate weeaboos. Don't you?
My god, I actually don't breathe heavily, that freaks me out to an extent, I have a job, I am actually not an outcast at school. I am a weeaboo, but a closet one. My whole school knows I am one, but they don't give a shit. I can animate, draw, and write, I am surprised that I am getting good marks in school though because fuck that shit.
This is a stupid channel
gr8 vid m8. What's the music that franku used when he entered the weeaboo protection chamber and when weeaboo Jones appeared. I'm hoping to use it in a video of my own.

She keeps saying "No I'm an Otaku" She has a body pillow is obsessed with anime, is planning on going to an anime convention, is learning Trying to learn Japanese , has made anime references in her account names, has self made anime costumes, and is planning on going to an anime convention.

what is a peasant doing outside your window?
"THESE PEOPLE WITH ANIME AVATARS!"
...
Check your privilege
Nicholas Gurewitch is the person who coined the phrase "Weeaboo" which really meant nothing other than something bad in the comic he made up. The problem I see with the word is that it is too broad; "obnoxious, immature, and ignorant about the culture they love" pretty much sums up the word but from whose perspective? As far as polling goes I do know that Otaku in Japan are gradually getting a better image as the word can be used for any obsessive interest, and that subgroups exist over there. As for weeabos interviews with random Japanese citizens said that "any foreign interest in Japan was a good thing", and why wouldn't it be? The Japanese economy is staggering, and those who are ignorant about their culture in their words might adapt over time.
his voice is so sexy in the beginning
please make a video that i can watch in public
Everyone on here is either hating on anime or on frank damn
Anime is fine, I've watched anime, but weeabos are fucking trash though lol
i'ma basterd
Watching anime used to be ok. Then everything changed when the weeaboos attacked
There is so much true shit in this video it becomes beautiful, I don't know if that makes sense but I've seen just 2 videos of Flithy Frank and I already love him (?)
The irony since the filthy frank show is such a popular anime
Fucker
Wanna hear a joke?

American animation (excluding My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Invader Zim and South Park)
i enjoy anime and even collect some small stuff from anime i really like like someone would buy something from their favourite show like Game of Thrones for example....but then i watch people reviewing animes in rooms full of hentai posters, mangas from everysingle anime in the universe that they dont read for sure, wearing anime school girl clothing and other shit and just make me wanna facepalm...YOU DONT HAVE TO LOOSE YOUR LIFE TO LIKE SOMETHING YOU WEABOOS

Watch for the signs of weabooism: A growing neck beard, General unhealthiness, a strong unpleasant odor, strange obsession with japan, the purchase of rosetta stone, ect. My friend showed some of these signs, and it was too late when I realized it. I had to put him down and by that I mean put a 9mm bullet between his eyes. Please don't make the same mistake as me.
You know those shows with the people who waste their lives preparing for the apocalypse. I bet none of them had a weaboo protection chamber #AlwaysbePreparedforTheWeabooApocalypse
what do you call someone who tries to be black?
"And it is scrumpdidlyumptious."
Goddamn weeaboos who have some fucking anime girl on their avatars...
DUDE it's called a ANIME CHARACTER a waifu is like a wife!!!! UHHHHGGG
my animo is rwby
did he say oh shit mom
This is so funny
Yeah I hate those fucking weebs with anime profile pics
If you want to see something similar to this video, look up "An Inconvenient Anime" by MillionDollarExtreme. In it, Sam Hyde does basically this except he does it while holding a speech in some weeaboo animecon, telling all the weeaboos straight to their face how scum they are.
"Xenophobia" is good though. It's not natural of different races to live together. The Japs got it right, keeping their island for themselves and nobody else. Everyone should be like that, then we would get a long a lot better with each other. Conflict stems from different races and cultures being too close to each other, as in, within the same cities.
Are you part Nip? Since it seems you can speak Japanese, and you kinda look like it too.
yes I'm I'm a filthy weeaboo ... a dirty weeaboo... a disgusting weeaboo

Are you retarded,or starved for attention.Were you abandoned and sexually abused in an orphanage or foster home.Because nothing is serious to you and your circle jerk it appears.I know it's an act.But is youtube as far as you wish to go.Say,hypothetically,10,20,30 years from now if you live that long.Will you be doing this or showing it off at family or party gatherings.Oh by the way,I'm making this my business.So saying it's none of my business may trigger the creature stalker within my BEING!!!!!!!ARRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!
I am a frankaboo, i have a pick guy suit and i devote my life to get papa frank to notice me! I once dyed my skin pink once...

Frank's gonna get banned for "bullying" cuz YouTube is full of pussies
This channel is horribly edited but thats what i love about it
it's True!!
honesty the fact that you have 1/4 of a million views makes me lose faith in humanity. I watched two of your videos tonight this one included and I have to say you're about as entertaining as watching paint dry. I remember thinking to myself when is this suppose to get funny? all I see is an angry goof. I wasn't honestly offended by any of the subjects you were attempting to make fun of. I just honestly couldn't believe that a sad sac of shit like yourself decided to make a video. You have zero talents like absolutely none don't quit your day job.
Telle tubbies favourite anime
Make fun of furries!!!!
My favorite anime is sex Ed DVDs
Bee Movie is my favorite anime
Also, what he said in japanese at the start means "There are two dead bodies of yudaya jin (i dont fking know what that means yet, i haven't perfected japanese yet.) in my closet"

From Narto
Don't Give a Damn about me
I search for strangers am I in the right place?
"...full dsigusting, unhygenic..." you literally went around the city picking up dead rats. And don't even get me started on vomit cake...
Filthyfrank is the dr Phil/ judge judy of the Internet
I enjoy anime and own a katana as something to display and belive that they look elegant and dangerous but why the fuck would you try to speak the language or be the culture. Just read or watch it and dont be a creepy fuck about it.
How is this funny...
The minute I saw the compilation of weaboos towards the end, I totally could just smell the failure radiating off the monitor.
to be honest the only reason I watch anime is because of my hope to potentially contract a terminal illness so that I can unironically leave this plane of existence
Anime sucks
At one point in the video i laughed so hard so i paused the video and went to like it but it was already liked...



you're a great man frank
Cailou is the prequel to One Punch Man.
The 3rd Reich is the best anime :) (the manga is better tbh)

Airplane Instruction Videos from the 80s are my favorite anime
Sure, I'm a Weaboo, But I'm not the person that's annoying and goes yelling "KAWAII DESU" And all that. I'm just a Weaboo who acts like a jerk.
let me piss people off:
Sword Art Online Sucks!
OMG. WHEN HE SAYS "ARE YOU READY TO HAVE SOME FUN?" HE'S ACTUALLY SAYING I HAVE TWO JEWISH PEOPLE IN MY CLOSET AND WHEN HE SAYS "I SURE AM" HES ACTUALLY SAYING THEYRE BOTH DEAD.

This is what I call high quality entertainment
papa franku distracts me from my inner pain
The anime talk at 4:11 man.

That really, really gets to me. I think I've grown a genuine hatred for highly pitched and slightly over enthusiastic japanese speaking.

"Lol das racist"
Who's the girl at 10:00?
5188 weaboos
I do enjoy a little hentai on the down low
Just give the Weebs twenty pounds of Quentin Tarantino.
He is so weird but all he says is truu

Years later, it's still cringeworthy.
In the subtitles it said you can find them in your ball sack
I just found you're YouTube channel and Jesus man LOL
I seriously need that Weeaboo Jones music.
Come on we all know the fresh prince of bel air is the best anime

I have this one fucking girl in my class who is BEYOND a weeaboo....A weeabooier weeaboo...?
Anyway, she hates socializing and is a crazy bitch who hurts anyone that "bothers" her. She watches so much ATT in school.

Ahh yess




Burn her alive
Pretty sure this is modern art.
Filtyh Frank Show is the best animu
My favorite anime is TVFilthyFrank
The only "anime" I've ever watched was Pokemon
I enjoy watching anime and such and I want to learn Japanese, am I Weeaboo though? Someday I want to visit Japan and learn their language and such so I understand what people are saying....
Toy story is my favourite animu
Power rangers is my favorite anime
funny¬†¬†¬† filthy frank is sexy
But now Frank has finally become Thomas The Frank Engine :') so happy for him achieving his dreams
My favorite anime is Good Luck Charlie
Collecting weapons isn't the problem, I do it legally and it's all good, but what makes me fall about laughing on the verge of insanity is when these weaboos threaten you with these said weapons that they apparently have only for it to be made out of cardboard/some flimsy shit material.
I remember the first time I watched this.... I cringed so much. 
now I'm related  :D
yeah anime profile pic ...so stupid. 
‚äô‚ñΩ‚äô
I have a Pokemon profile picture... R.I.P.
After seeing your video, Frank, I now understand what a "weeabo" is and must admit that not only the Japanese culture has this stereotype problem. The key word in this video is to not take things too far (as other fellow commenters have pointed out). For example, I'm a Latino and my culture repeatedly gets associated with drug trafficking, immigrants, etc. Point is, people should not put random stereotypes at cultures just for what they see in TV and movies. üòî
He said he has two dead Jews in his closet... That's abit creepy...
Katrina was the best anime ever, fucking weeaboos probably never even seen it.
Katrina was the best anime ever, fucking weeaboos probably never even seen it.
Would I be a Weeaboo if I named my daughter Anna Mae because it's sounds like Anime? Nevermind I'm leaving now..

My favorite anime is Stanley Kubrick's Shining.

Possibly the funniest vid he's ever done. Laugh every time
This is were all the kids went to learn this word, so they call anyone who likes anime a weeaboo
So me collecting Rifles from WW2 is weeaboo shit?
where did you goo?
I remember whenever I get bored I go to the library for unlimited amounts of internet I can use because there's 30 computers there and I remember this one black weeaboo stereotype that has this 2 liter Dr pepper and watches fairy tail for 3 hours on end and I was 2 seats away from him playing roblox because I don't have pc games or jack shit so that was my entertainment and there was this oder that I have to smell my Pepsi by the second. I even wiped Pepsi on my chest so I smell my chest in stead of that smell of...I don't even know.
I want to die now
But srrsly aot sux i havent Watched it seems like sh*t
Does Pokemon count as anime
The only anime I watch is Attack on Titan but I only like to watch it on tv so it's in English a lot of times I just want to lay down and watch and not have to read. So I wish Netflix had an English dubbed version. 



I don't know why I said all of this because no one cares. XD

I lost it when his neighbors got back
I went to Japan and it was not what I expected, there where no subtitles under anyone, no one was practicing jutsu's in the corner, no one had kitanas, 
And as soon as I landed there by my moms private jet, Godzilla was not there! But worst of all, I went to a Japanese pet smart to find a pikachu,
But I got my ribs broken by getting tackled by a Japanese guy who I thought was ash.  When I was in the hospital, BAYMAX WAS NOT THERE! 

Go to Laos instead.
when you're Japanese and know what he's saying üòÇüòÇ
AYYYYYYY LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

MY FAVORITE ANIME IS SHREK
TRIGER
I REQUIRE A TRIGER WARNING
So many weaboos, god no, they have invaded the comment section and there out numbering us. Fall back to the keep! Fall back!
okay let's put into account how racist it is if you really think that all Japanese people actually do have a bunch of body pillows and overall have no lives, so even if you think somebody wants to be a certain race because of his or her actions then you're racially stereotyping which ever race that one person wanted to be and whomever is just as wrong for thinking the same thing.
liking a different culture more than your own is fine in my opinion because culture doesn't determine race, race is just a label given to you because of the native home of your ancestors and the genes that formed along the years to help them survive in whichever place they called home. Culture is just a lifestyle created by a single race. I'm Brazilian but I grew up in America so does that mean I'm American for being under the influence of American culture? 
nope
Does that mean I consider myself American? 
I could, but I'm not. 
Does it mean I want to be American? 
I could want that, I could be walking around with my cowboy hat and my guns and do American stuff like shoot up schools and hate immigrants....you see how offensive this is? and no I don't want to be American and even if I wanted to it wouldn't change the fact that I'm not. My point is we can't discriminate people based off assumptions we made towards a person desires until that person is exposed.


Too long didn't read
Weebs be like! "Um frank u are a weeabo too" "Um i'm technically Japanese" "No ur not" "Safari man tell him" "Yeah frank is a weeb"kappa

tells the pigeon who's house it is
Frank did 7/11
When he moaned I laughed like shit
He looks like a different person without his glasses..
This. This. This is why weeaboos like I want to kill them selves.
So I found some guys arguing about anime in a comment thread. One of them said "You can't be an otaku if you only watch dubbed anime."
Now I'm sitting here on this video with a bottle of chlorox contemplating suicide.
trump did 7/11
frank is my spirit animal. or should i say, "anime-l"?
Damn Wapanese.
this guy deserves more subs
This is why I don't watch anime...

filthy frank is so kawai
Hey it's the "It's time to STOP!" guy.

My fellow friends and americans weve all seen what these weeaboos are. now im asking that all of you stand with me today not just as americans bit as americans that hate weeaboos. with me by your side we will not go quietly into the night, we are going to live on, we are going to survive, today we celebrate our independence day, from weeaboos
It's funny because my brother is one
I'm in a very confusing spot since I'm half-Japanese, half-American, but born in Shizuoka. Yet my parents divorced and I bounced back and forth between Japan and America all my life. People often called me "weaboo" (I had to originally look it up) while I had Americans simultaneously telling me to go back to my "own country" (is that Japan or America?).

It doesn't help that I don't speak Japanese as fluently as a native and can't read most kanji in spite of Japanese being my first language (went to middle and high school in the U.S.). My English also has an accent that people say they can't place (it's partly British since I went to British school in Singapore for a while).

I have both a Japanese and U.S. passport and I never could quite decide whether I'm supposed to be American or Japanese, so lately I just tell people that I'm Russian since I think Russian guys are really macho and Russian girls are really hot.

I also don't like anime or manga very much except for the ones I watched as a kid growing up (Saint Seiya, Hokuto no Ken, Doraemon, Golgo 13, Pro Golfer Saru, things of this sort and purely on a nostalgia basis).

Anyway, I hate being called weaboo since my fondness for Japanese culture came from my upbringing, from nostalgia and just having some Japanese sensibilities instilled in me from childhood. It wasn't like some choice born out of some geeky fandom. I spent my early childhood in Shizuoka, Yokohama, and Tokyo.
ive been trying so hard to find out what the visual novel or anime is @1:19 but googling "pink-haired loli neko girl" is giving me a lot of results and aids
avatar is da best anime
you know hiragana, but do you know katakana and kanji
U LITTLE HORNY MOTHERFUKCER THAT HASNT EVER SEEN A VAGINA.........HOW FUCKING DARE U CRITICIZE ANIME U LITTLE WASTE OF SPERM FUCK U.... KIRITO IS COOL AND U ARE NOT

Im glad im chinese so i dont have to worry about chinese weebs
wait... what... if my very very meager japanese is near correct instead of saying are you ready for fun he said he has 2 guys or some shit in his closet and they are both dead... whut
Unfortunately theres no difference between bronies and people that like my little pony. We're all filthy and sick people much like weeaboos.
5k weeaboos
do a video only in japanese!
Attack on Titan is overrated. It doesn't have any character development and plot is predictable. Main characters are stereotypical and boring.
Song where weeaboo jones appears?
i hate fucking animes southpark ftw!!!

Thomas the tank engine is the best anime character
I lived in Japan for three years and I still don't know all that much
Good song horrible lyrics
10:02 that picture made me puke.
Am I the only one who mistook Frank for Kirei from Fate Zero?
i think waifuism is the saddest disease of them all.

 its pretty much just the belief that either a pre-existing or newly created anime character is betrothed to you, meaning that you basically have an intimate relationship with such character

 the saddest part is that it's all in their head and it becomes easily blended with a person's perception of reality. good thing papa franku has those reality checks. hes a goddamn miracle worker...
Damn weebs
Shit I'm sorry
do more
Anime is just some drawings with no story or anything funny about 






Come at me
this guy is inappropriate and crude too bad that wastes is channel he is pretty funny
I have to try playing my recorder through one of my nostrils now.
Ok now I really want a body pillow
I'm jealous of his neighbours... Oh how I'd wish to be Franku's neighbour...
My friend's going to japan with the only words he knows are:

Obviously the best anime to ever exist, is Howtobasic. I OWN THE INTIRE EGG COLLECTION!!!
you, know... I don't quite get this video, the about section of his acocunt says

Filthy Frank is the embodiment of everything a person should not be. He is anti-PC, anti-social, and anti-couth. He behaves and reacts excessively to everything expressly to highlight the ridiculousness of racism, misogyny, legalism, injustice, ignorance and other social blights. He also sets an example to show how easy it is in the social media for any zany material to gain traction/followings by simply sharing unsavoury opinions and joking about topics many find offensive.Yes, there is no denying that the show is terribly offensive, but this terrible offensiveness is a deliberate and unapologetic parody of the whole social media machine and a reflection of the human microcosm that that social media is.

but alot of what he says is totally legit. I mean certainly he is adressing an exageration of what a weeb is but he seemed to only really care about the extreme weeaboos anyway.
Pepper Pig is my favourite anime.
something about the fucking poo qualities of franks videos is what makes them good
FUCK YOU FRANK YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE MY WAIFU TOLD ME ABOUT YOU SO I CHECKED YOU OUT AND SAW THIS VIDEO YOU MADE MY WAIFU CRY SO NOW I WILL FIND YOU AND KILL YOU
Am I a weeb yet?
DID HE SAY THAT THERES TWO DEAD PEOPLE IN HIS CLOSET OR

I'm crying üòÇ
Does this count as an anime avatar
Cori in the house is the best anime
Lol when he said anime avatar XD I have one but i don't watch anime and I'm not a weaboo I just found it on google once and liked it cause the guy is holding a cat I wanna Kms now
It's true. Japanese cultural xenophobia and racism  (culture as a whole, not Japanese people) is almost never even acknowledged, never mind discussed. It's just a thing that exists. Just saying.
I CAN'T BREATHE!
The people that dislike are Weeaboos
What if you act like your favourite anime character?
0:27 Cancer*
well I just wasted 11 mins of my life
anime is cancer, weeaboos are the death. weeaboos did 9/11
ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THIS A THUMBS DOWN THEY ARE WEEABOOS
i got here from a video in my recommendations and then i clicked the link on said video...


hey can someone please show me out. to who it my concern I got here from a Japanese people recat to weabos. Not used to this part of youtube.
omfg they put a anti teen smoking add on his video regular watchers will understand
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
HEY I LOVE ANIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!But im not a weeaboo or what ever,because I am a Bavarian German nationalist/patriot leader.I love Japan,yes,but I don't even know all that much about Japan,but I still love anime,doesn't make me a denouncer of my culture.PLUS NO ONE HATES ANIME AND GETS AWAY WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!
The songs get stuck in my head
Full House is the best anime hands down.
wft i love animo :,(
one time at barnes and noble there was this parade of cosplayers in the manga section and I screamed "SAO SMUT HALF OFF" and they all came running. I almost broke my nose.
My favorite hentai is ISIS torture feed
How do I mod minecraft?
I don't see any anime profile pictures here. Nope. None.
It would be hilarious if someone walked in on him through all this lol
ok. I used to watch anime quite a bit. I haven't watched hardly any at all since last september. My friends kept on bothering me about it. I think it's ok if you want to watch anime if you want to. I'm adopted and I texted my birth sister a couple of months ago and her entire family watches anime. It's kind of weird that me and my twin brother watched anime. I think it's funny when my friends started to put themselves higher than me. Just from anime they thought they were better than everyone else. Lol i stopped because of you lol. Watching anime doesn't make you worse or better. people have different tastes. and besides the people calling weeaboos out most likely have no lifes and just play PC. I don't think it's nice for people like frank to put themselves higher than other people. weeaboo's are a real thing. And it's defiantly a problem socially I guess. but fans of this video and the internet rephrased it into thinking that just watching anime makes you a weeb. weebs can be very disgusting.
Hold up a sec. I like attack on titan. And have a katana. Does this make me a weeaboo. (btw im white)
Hahahahahahaaha at the intro when he says "are you ready to have some fun? Sure i am." He actually said "there are 2 jewish in my closet. And their both dead" in japanese lol such a troll 
P.s. Im not a weaboo. Im just simply a japanese who enjoys his video
My favorite anime is isa
am i the only one that died when he spoke normal ? ;-;

@TVFilthyFrank I know you despise weeaboos and wannabe Japanese people. But Do you despise those who enjoy and watch Anime? I know Anime is just cartoons in the end of the day. I don't know your experience but yea.

Hentai is my favorite anime of all time!

Hey I have a anime profile pic. I'm not a weeb I just watch the Anime. Ok don't roast me please, I'm just a your normal Asian guy ok.
I'll suck your dick for a pound of dope
Do I count as a weeb if I'm studying Japanese and wanting to go to Japan and be a manga artist? I can draw manga (I'm not the best artist, just saying) I enjoy watching a lot of anime but I never own a body pillow or a katana and I never will.
lol!!
Imagine if a japanese guy watched an American tv show and said "ooh,i rike this american show,i are move to america now!" Would they be a reverse-weeabo?
Hentai is Tv for me now

He kept mentioning Rosetta Stone , makes me wonder if he actually did it to help learn more Japanese .
thank you for making this video dude
i like a few normal anime like dragon ball and one piece but these guys watch full on hentai and if i say i like fucking dragon ball people think i also watch this 1:17 and look like this 9:04 and 9:09 i have a fucking life but because of these people (weeaboos) people think this is my room 10:12
If you extend the Weeaboo protection part to an hour, you got a horror movie.
Yea i just like the anime. Culu creamy mushirumus... I learnt that from attack on pokeystone
Fellow weebs it's time to begin an uprising to destroy all the non-weebs. They are getting in the way of our pleasurable hentai. They make our waifus cry out in sadness and pain. They must all be eradicated. I will no longer live on this earth as a minority and neither shall you. Remember this: WE ARE THE SPERM THAT WON!
British lords collect kitanas. many japanese collect European armor. so what?
Btw, Japanese are not xenophobic. racism is everywhere, but from my experience there (traveled to India and China as well, so no, not a weeaboo)they are quite welcoming to foreigners. those who are racist tend to be more so against other Asian cultures. it IS a largely homogenized society. again, your lack of vocabulary will cause ignorant people to remain ignorant, but with attitude. you're funny and I feel like I want to like your videos, but then you go and say something completely misleading and damaging.
2:39 same..... i no the pain
Hitler's speeches are the best anime.
This is the magnum opus of Papa Franku
Yuta made a reaction video to this with random Japanese people from the street
Frank, stories, in whatever form they are presented, have been passed around globally since stories were first told (figuratively speaking). in my time everyone in school was passing around Pokemon and football z cards, writing their names in Asian characters and wearing bhuddist bracelets - even those who didn't watch anime. this sort of thing has always happened around the world for thousands of years. even our ancient ancestors "cosplayed" so to speak. Victorian England, for example, was in love with greco-Roman culture and infused much of their art and writing with it. X-men was inspired by Japanese manga. people across the globe live Star Trek and pay tribute to it in many ways, the way humans have done since campfire stories and the birth of theater. now we have things like conventions and the internet to expand on the different ways people do so. and, apart from that, I heard weeaboos is what you call someone who pretends to be Japanese, this does not include putting on a wig and enthusiastically talking about a favorite anime or it's merchandise (that would be racist and misleading because Japanese people aren't like that.) that's what you call an otaku, not a weeaboo. now my question: what do you call non-Americans fans that cosplay or learn English words, or inform themselves more of our culture when inspired by an American comic or movie? what do you call Alexander the Great who loved all things foreign so much he encouraged his officers and friends to Mary Persian and Asian women? What do you call Russians dressing up as Star Wars characters? What about anyone who is not from India, that prefer their styles of fashion, music, and beliefs? What do you call a Japanese person that collects Transformers...wait, Transformers is Japanese....that collects Marvel action figures and posters and dresses up as wolverine for comicons? I believe the word you are looking for is otaku. either that or your cringy display misleads people to think westerners who cosplay anime characters and by body pillows are wannabe Japanese - which is not the same as admiring, loving the Japanese culture and wanting to experience it. plenty of people that don't watch anime feel that way about many countries, including Asians about western countries. you're not very eloquent. weeaboos are non Japanese people that entertain the delusion that they are Japanese and wear make up to look Asian, no nothing of the culture but elect to talk about it as if it's their own. it doesn't necessarily exclusive to anime, because anime is not what Japanese culture is all about. last night, two trolls decided to call me a weeaboos because I like anime (as I like books, movies, video games, plays, of many nations and cultures across the globe). please do not mislead people with your inarticulate rants. words are powerful, they influence people, and you are causing many young idiots to run around calling anyone that so much as eats pocky a weeaboo. take some responsibility and try better to articulate precisely what "disgusts" you. personally what disgusts me in this world are people with so much hate and anger towards others that they'll never meet but wish to negatively impact their lives anyway. that and rapists, murderers, terrorists, racism, cruelty, pollution. fools, not so much. they are annoying when you meet them but that's about it. perhaps you should do some traveling, studying, experiencing beyond YouTube - expand your knowledge and intelligence. it will help you speak more clearly and the content itself will be well thought out and insightful. rather than ignorant and emotional. :) only a suggestion of course.
getting sunlight and go with friends have the best animation out there. i am guilty as well. it takes time to recover.
Spanish dramas is my favorite anime
watch out, weaboos has the disease called "fast typing fagggot". OH wait they Will spam me after this post,  why Did i post this?

I'm not a weeaboo but I mean there's nothing wrong if you are. America and Americans are fucked up so I mean it makes sense üòÇ You could do all the things a weeaboo does and not be a weeaboo if you aren't trying to be Japanese. Idk what do y'all think?
5:11
Does are really good anime guy impressions
Fur sure sharing this with my friends
"I need feminism because Waifus deserve the same respect as real womens"

He sounds like naruto üòë
Hentei
I'm 1/4 Japanese and I couldn't care less about anime.
When the subs say "Are you ready to have fun?" He really said something like "There's two dead Jews in the closet."
I gotta feeling the subtitles don't exactly match what Frank is actually saying
4:30- just watch it
I like his Japanese.
How come a lot of people here in the comment section still not know what a weeaboo is? Papa Franku went over the definition of a weeaboo. Like seriously, stop hating on the people who like classic animes including Inuyasha, Angel Cop, The Diary of Anne Frank, SpongeBob, Cory Baxter in the House(my favorite), and Shrek. The first part was serious though. If I bring up anything about anime people just go "Kys", "Weeaboo", and "weeb".
I'm the one exception to the rule of a katana collection. I own a karate school that teaches people to use those weapons.

I watch anime. But I don't give a shit that it's anime, I watch it for the content, not where it's from. If it's a good story and good action, I don't give a shit what it is.
I'm learning Japanese. Because I'm a linguist; I love learning other languages. I'm learning French, too.
I like swords. But that was true long before I even knew what anime was; I've been a fan of fantasy (swords and magic and shit) stories since I was little.
Fuck weaboos, they make all the actually normal people with any of these qualities look like shit.
SHREK IS MY FAV ANIMOO
we was doin an experiment with chopsticks at school and some girl goes" aw man i dont know how to use chopsticks" and the weeaboo next to her just like fucking loses it " WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DONT KNOW HOW TO ?!/ USE CHOPSTKKSIKCSK!??"

WEEABOOS ARE EVERYWHERE

Why do people in anime have big eyes when all asians hav small eyes
People say I'm a Weeaboo even though I only watch a few anime. Now If you turn back time when I was like 13 then yes I was a fucking cancerous Weeaboo. I cringe when I dig through my memories.

Well, I mean I like anime and all and that's why I have a picture of Natsu Dragneel as my FB profile picture. But I do know for a fact that I'm not a weaboo.

Anyone else think he looks like Daniel Radcliffe?
My favorite anime is Nagasaki. It's so realistic
I love will smith, he is by far the best anime character of all time.
Cowboy Tanaka Motherfuckers
I don't watch anime but I play a lot of fire emblem and sometimes hang around actual weeaboos online for a combination of pure trash and other fire emblem fans. I always carry a reality check to be careful, so I count as a filthy disgusting nerd who likes a bit of weeb trash on the side.

White people
Been ruining things since Jesus Harold Christ
too much high tension. alomost madness. there is no one like him in japan. He is nothing to do with Japan
Corey in the house is my favourite anime
I know a really gross girl at my school who's a weeaboo, I threw a French book at her and popped a bunch of her face pimples.
Y'know, I agree with you. Weeaboos are usually annoying. But I have two problems.
1. I don't think the term 'weeaboo' should be thrown around too much. Now no one can even simply appreciate the culture without being called a weeaboo. Anyone who simply likes Japan's culture gets called a weeaboo now. Oh, you have an anime profile picture? You're a weeaboo. Oh, you're learning Japanese? You're a weeaboo. Yes, some people like the Japanese culture a bit more than other people. But that doesn't make them a weeaboo. I believe you're a weeaboo when you throw away your own culture for that of Japans and/or simply believe Japan is the best country and nothing compares. If someone simply likes Japan and wants to learn more about Japan, then they aren't a weeaboo. They're simply an otaku (someone who likes Japanese culture, but still stays true to their own culture). I hate ignorant people who don't know the difference and call everyone who likes anime a weeaboo. In fact, they're worse than the weeaboos themselves. Anyway, my other problem is:
2. This one is to a lesser extent, but even if you are a weeaboo, I don't think you should be made fun of. In fact, I don't think any fandom should be made fun of. (this whole section will be talking about fandoms in general, but it also applies to weeaboos). A lot of fandoms are called things like 'cancerous' and 'obnoxious'. A good (and very recent) example is the Undertale fandom. Well guess what? You don't have to pay attention to them. You don't have to make fun of them because they like a certain thing. Now there are some people who take it to another level and talk about nothing but whatever it is that they like and you can't have a conversation about anything else with them and/or they think anyone who doesn't like the same thing as them suck. I can see why people hate those kinds of people. But in all honesty, not that much of any fandom is like that. For example, I'm friends with a few weeaboos (people who think Japan is the best country) and guess what? They aren't that bad. They talk about other things besides anime and Japan. I can have a normal conversation with them. Now, people who hate anyone who is a weeaboo is another story. Why would you make fun of people who like a certain thing? Seriously. It's really immature to be honest. The point is you can ignore them. Everyone is happy then. You don't have to argue and they don't have to get pissed off and/or feel bad for simply liking a certain thing. If you do make fun of them, then they'll get pissed off and you'll have to argue. In fact, you're making it worse. By doing that you could turn them into someone who thinks whoever doesn't like the same thing as they do sucks.
Anyway, if you want to reply please say something intelligent. I don't want to turn this into a flame war or anything, I'm just giving my opinion on the matter. I'm fine with debating, but if you're just gonna call me a weeaboo or something like that then you will be ignored.
Airplane instruction videos from the 80s?? FINALLY! Someone else who shares my passion. That anime changed my life, and brought new meaning to it. They way they- oh shit spoilers! Just watch episode three, it's the best!

that people who keep telling that anime and cartoon is different which is technically the same(anime stands for "animation")
that people who keep telling that power ranger is different from super sentai which is the same except for the actor/ress,language,and license(PW usually and adaptation from Super sentai)
that people who obessed with 2D character(ftw is that,it is so weird)
etc.
I watch anime too,but it just an entertaiment..not all of your life you put on it.

Well im here as well XD. Not a weeaboo but just someone who likes anime and uses it as my avatarlol
the only reason some people get mad when someone says something bad about anime is mostly because it has a stupid reason like calling someone a weeaboo if they have a anime avatar

Let's be honest guys, having a waifu is much more better than dealing with Tuber kids, Drama queens, quick agitated teenagers, attention whores, swaggies, and kids under age of 10 over the internet. Especially when it comes to dating.

Im not from Europe or America and if I decide to reject my own culture and watch only hollywood movies, listen only to songs in english, read comic books well people don't give a shit about it ... however if I watch anime, read manga or listen to j-pop then they tell me to kill myself.

My classmate has been corrupted by this channel. Not franks fault, mind you. This fuck, just because I like anime, calls me a weeaboo, when in reality he has full fucking collections of manga. I don't own a SINGLE manga. And because I'm a furry, he sits there saying "drink bleach drink bleach drink bleach drink bleach". he's lucky i don't stab him. He also calls me cancer. I mean, don't get me wrong, he's corrupted by frank's videos, but it's not frank himself who is at fault. It's the fact that this fucker (classmate) has the mental capacity of a medium sized fucking salad.
you know one of the guys you showed in the song was arrested for child rape, or something like that.
so much sex with my body pillow that it stands on its own üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Anime is just a cartoon.
im dying!!!!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Watching this in school XD






Wish me luck lol
I have no idea why these sad cringefests exist. I watch one anime, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which I loved, and a bunch of Godzilla movies as a kid, but why the fuck would I denounce my own culture and ethnicity because I watched some animated TV shows from another country?
Damn... that shit good
I see your concerns...

I don't get too far like them.
Fuck Weeaboos with a passion.

FRANKU 4 PRESIDENT 2017
What if you are actually japanese, watch anime  have anime shit, and katanas but dont know how to speak the language? Does that make you a weeaboo?
Does Dedede count as a waifu
IM GONNA GET THE FEMITITS ON YOU, I FEEL DEEPLY OFFENDED CAUSE MY LAST BROTHER RODGER WAS A KATANA AND DIED OF HAVING NO IMMUNE SYSTEM, HE COULD BE HERE TODAY TO SLICE YOUR ASS IF YOU HAD ONE. I AM A WHITE 
HETEROSEXUAL FEMALE AND I AM LUCKY ENOUGH THAT I RAN FAST ENOUGH FROM THOUGHS HURTFUL COMMENTS. MY TITTYGIVER AND MONEYGIVVER BEFORE ME WERE WEABOOS AND HAVE RAISED IT THROUGH THE FAMILY, HONESLTY I FIND HTIS OFFENSIVE TO MY RELIGION AND MY STATE OF LIVING, PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKE THIS WORLD SICK, YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO A GENDERFEMITIT.
So does cosplaying make you a weeaboo?
AJIN DEMI HUMAN
Click Bait
We all know Cory in the House is the best anime
In the beginning you sound like one of those serious businessmen that don't like screwing up anything then anti-puberty hits and you sound like you have the flu or some shit while trying to drink water continuously....





That's supposed to be a compliment
does it make you a pedophile if there your same age ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Wow 5,000 weebs watched this video
is there a difference between otaku and weaboos
People spent over 108 years watching this video (minutes watched) Best 108 years ever lmao
Airplane saftey videos from the 80s
the best anime is boondocks and black dynamite
OMG I died because of your video XD I'm in heaven now it's quite pretty here
All jokes aside you're a good singer
No uploads Ina year
Finally someone that knows the difference between a Otaku and a Weeaboo. 90% of anime lovers are not weeaboos.
I have a few weeaboo friends, and every time I say "anime is really just cartoons" they're all instantly like "but they're from japan" 




THAT DOESN'T FUCKING DISQUALIFY IT FOR BEING A CARTOON ITS STILL A CARTOON ITS JUST FROM JAPAN
1:03 subtitles: they're in your ball sack
Frank: "I know what I need to do"
Me: Pray to the Bass God?
Frank: "F*ck you weeaboo Jones I like Family Guy!"
Me: I'm kinda disappointed, eh still hilarious tho
Thank god I watched this video I haven't gone as far as weaboos filthy frank. I think if I become one I might as well kill myself along with the other weaboos who watched this
It's bad to watch this guy if you're eating
Im obsessed with Filthy Frank.

I love you Frank your one of my best youtubers I have ever watched you always keep a smile on my face even tho you have some gross videos it still has a little comedy in love you bro and he safeüëåüëä
Its because of this guy I got harlem shaked. It was 11th grade, a pep rally. The music started and I had high hopes. My first harlem shake, mind as well make the best of it. The beat drops and hundreds of kids are running to the center of the gym. Next thing i know in trapped between kids that smelled like they decided not to shower in a week and played football everyone of those days. I almost died.
All dislikes are week boos
I remember watching this when it had like 509k views. Now it's 20 times that. Crazy...
hado-chan: i look rly ugly in this pic
Me: no u dont ur vry pretty u kno
hado-chan: ur just sayin that idiot
Me: stop being tsundere you are very pretty i love you hado-chan
hado-chan: i love you too andy-kun always
Me: me too

I can't...
I agree with this on an emotional level.
I'm learning Japanese, like anime, respect the culture and plan to visit Japan. But I don't think I'm obsessed. Am I a weaboo I hope not.
I have a girl at my school that says "kawaii" or "senpai" without watching anime or knowing what it means.
I love anime but like other things are better and I have a reason if I buy swords or katanas because I practice my karate forms with it like i'm getting a sword when I get to my first apprentice belt
me
You should be an anime voice actor
To be honest sack and Cody is my favourite anime
What if I am weeaboo but I am trying to properly learn Japanese

I don't think it's Japanese because I went on Translate and it was not similar to Frank's
This avatar comes from Star Fox. Does that make me a weeaboo? Or memetic? Or a memetic weeaboo?
What's the point of the protection chambers
my sister is practically the living inbodyment of a weaboo
But, isn't Attack on Titan already shit to begin with?

His best video by far üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Interesting and inspiring video, I showed this to some, and they stopped watching anime altogether. You need to do a video about Furries.
you people want to know the best anime?
its fucking 9/11
Where are the subtitles
I just do that if I'm not comfortable with showing my face on the app... then I'll put my real face. I love drawing anime .. I don't watch it that much..
Suprised I didn't see double4anime in this video
Fifty frank = man-pussy eater confirmed

LMAO WTTFFFF WEEABOOS GOING TO JAPAN AND BEING ALL LIKE "WHERE R THE SUBTITLES"
the 5 k weebos disliking this video lmao
ily frank
checks comment for triggered weeaboos.
I watch anime but act pretty normal, but there's this really fucking weird girl in my class who'll just shout nonde(what) whenever she's confused and only ever talks about anime.
The 5K dislikes are from Weeaboos who to Japanese people are literally just raping their culture.
Cory in the House is the best anime.
I also love Shrek
Even thought im a weeaboo. I find this shit funny as hell.
Is that his real voice?
in Arabia I thought goat simulator was a dating simulator
I love the anime "Filthy Frank"
I can't believe people have collections that huge. I'm interested in anime and Japanese culture but nothing is better than being AMERICAN!!!! These people have wasted their lives and need to go outside.
Etalio ETALIO!!!
W...t...f... did I just watch!?!?! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
When he's speaking... Chinese... I think, put on English-auto generated, damn. XD
Just found this channel and had an erection... is this normal?

Full House is the greatest Anime
Weeaboos are cancer
I want to know what the protection chamber is, and why frank has full access to using it
I'm crafting right now XD
is this guy a japanese
After this video my nico nico knees stopped working rip
Look at dat like ratio
Your parents must be really disappointed in what you do for a living
I like anime, usually Attack on Titan keeps me occupied. Yes, I'm obsessing over it, but it's a phase, I phase through videogames and this is the first TV show I obsess over. First it was Okami, then Zelda, then Attack on Titan- But learning japanese from ANIME and calling yourself japanese? To heck with that. I can't even speak spanish or roll my "r", and my famiy is mexican, AND they speak spanish like 75% of the time.
I have a friend that's a weeb. It's a struggle dealing with him
when weaboo Jones came out shit turned into a horror movie
my favorite anime is Hitler's bizarre adventure
YES! FUCK THE WEEBOO FAGGOTS! THEY DON'T DESERVE SHIT. THEY NEED TO BE TREATED LIKE ANIMALS, BECAUSE THEY SURE SMELL LIKE THEM
Cory in the house LOLLLLL

King of The Hill is the best anime ever
It's been a while since I've seen this video, but is there a cop car outside your window at 2:48? It looks like blue and red lights are reflecting on your face.
philip defranco intro

I need help. I think my Friend has a terrible disease. He is a Russian male. It started when he said that his idol was a video game character from a game called Borderlands 2. Then it got worse when he told people that he wanted to bomb America for Russia. I did everything I could to fix it, but I just made it worse. Now, he's calling people in his class gay, selling gaming keyboards to his friends, watching crappy anime and abridged series, and daydreaming about his "future company." Is there anything I can do to save him?
I'm a comin' for ya Frank! O wO
5007 people were weeadoos
just subbed to this channel. its ticking hilarious
my fave anime is "Biography of Nazi Germany"
The Victoria Secret shows are my favourite anime!
WHY AM I JUST SEEING THIS?!?! HE IS AWESOME

Goku is my favorite character in naruto
my favorite anime is fuckin rugrats, I want a body pillow of fuckin tommy.
I hate anime , it's for idiot kids who don't know what real life is.... 








(let the weeabos attack)
In the beginning of the video, he was talking in Japanese. The last two sentences were "I got two Jews in my closet. They're both dead." I couldn't stop laughing for 3 minutes xD
Weeanoos wang jobs at Nintendo
I miss his look without the hat and sunglasses man
i just find that stuff cool. like, i am not hopeless enough to get a body pillow, but a sword works better in the apocalypse.
the fighting scene is actually edited better than my country's local tv shows for kids
Why do those weeaboos that are like 275+ pounds think they look cool when they're holding swords, what do they think their gonna be able to do with it, swing it like a samurai. The only thing they'll be able to do with it is waddle menacingly towards their intended target only to have that person outrun their sumo looking ass.
Did anyone else notice that salamander man just talks about pussyüòÜüòÜüòÜ
Fuck Weeaboos.
I'm really interested in an anime called Tokyo ghoul, but I'm staying as far away from that weaboo shit as possible.
lmao

Anime is just cartoon Japanese porn
I'm Canadian, Norwegian, Swedish, and Chinese. I look COMPLETELY chinese, except I have some european features. My friends and I have a joke where I open my eyes up and scream in an accent, "WHITE PERSON HELLO!" ... yep.... I'm fucked up...
7:54 It that the Conniver's Kunai from tf2?

Anime is a disease and he is the cure coming 2078 Filthy Frank weeaboo hunter rated R
I tried to show like 6 of my friends your videos but they didn't understand any of them and didn't laugh. But That's probably because their 12 and they took you to seriously.. Except that I'm 14.
I'd rather have to deal with hardcore fanboys than weeaboos. Weeaboos are the reason I can't read manga or watch anime without being called a "Weeaboo"
this is hands down, the best thing I've seen
Blackops3 Scyth up the ass with no ammo

My favorite anime is the room,jungle book,and ghostbusters

This channel is so kawaii. Frank is my senpai.
Is this his natural voice?
Frank, your japanese is wonderful!
My favorite anime is Antz.

I can't be the only one who finds him attractive ......
i hate weeaboos and yet there is so many in my school its not even funny
4:50 SCRUMP DIDILLY UMPTIOUS.
This is just amazing but I think you forgot constantly looking at "yaoi" (gay porn) and completely denying that's it's porn, saying shit like " I only like the cute stuff!" Even though some of it is soft core witch is still a type of porn they still won't admit it even when there is clearly some dick in that pic! P.S. I hate anime but don't hate people because of it.
this is why Japan deserves a third nuclear bombing with all of the Weaboos in their
*checks comments for weeaboos"
Frank's vegan video was kinda like a throw back to this. I love this cancerous content.
Your such a pussy you should go play with your pussy friends in Lego land üñïüèø

Lol . I thought weaboos were some kind of nerdy people but now that frank cleared things up, I'm definitely changing my profile PIC. Don't confuse me with those subhumans !

I actually learned a fair bit of Japanese and visited Japan.

Spoiler Alert: Ain't no samurai, or no kawaii-desu schoolgirls blushing everywhere. IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF OLD DUDES IN SUITS GETTING ON AND OFF TRAINS.
ANIME SUCKS....come at me

Like, I can't eat a simple biscuit without them saying "OMG SO ANIMU" Like... I can't even. I think we need to kill those who compare you to anime characters too. It makes us non-weeb casuals feel self concious x-x

people butcher the definition
I once was a weeabo like you



Then I took a reality check to the knee
Lmfao that intro! I wonder how many people got it?
I used to be one when I was 9
weaboo
I respect Japan because they've accomplished quite a bit in the past 100 years, but the Japs are racist as hell. I'm completely fine with it, but a lot of them believe in cultural and racial purity. They typically don't want some faggot coming to Japan and trying to pollute their gene pool and corrupt the culture with trying to live life as an anime.
How old are you actually
Goat Simulator is a really good dating sim.
Also my favorite filthy frank video
I have 1 katana, I love anime, and I have always wanted to go to Japan, but I still know how American I am.
I don't get it.. There's lots of weeaboos in the comment section
I'm going to kill myself because you insulted anime.
Mah favrite animu us spongebawb
You think Weebs are bad? You should see Fucking Hetaweebs. Their like Mutated weebs.

10:00 lol future me
Will you please stop cunfusing otokus with weeaboos I'm mean like yes you got most thing right about weeaboos but some of the things are otokus
I love Japanese culture but I don't think i'm Japanese, I also am not trying to learn the language, collect katanas, have a waifu, or believe everyone in subbed animes actually talk like that.....is that bad XD
Your poor voice box. Thank you for your sacrifice to the comedic cause.
Was he speaking Japanese in the intro
My favorite anime is allahu akbar

What makes this so much better is the fact that I got an ad for Crunchyroll before this video
so my question is what even is the culture of California  it's so mixed ( is this even the right spot to ask this question I dunno oh whale üêãüê≥)

Ugh, I hate mainstream anime.  Lazy Town is SO much better than Cory in the House
Blues Clues is my favorite anime
WEEABOOS GET ON MY FUCKING NERVES
The best part about this video is the people commenting about how 'unfunny' it is, when ironically, they have anime avatars.
Another bit of irony. Mexicans actually were the origin for the cowboy culture but americans ended up taking that cowboy culture further on (look up vaqueros). However, mexicans have very strong and positive international relations with japan.
weaboos be like: "bitch if you say another thing about goku I'll kame kame ha on your ass"
I have an Attack on Titan poster...does that make me a weeaboo?
types on the keyboard very fast
6:00 Best part
Drake and josh is best anime
SpongeBob SquarePants is the best Japanese cartoon, but Nickelodeon always play the dubbed version. JUST READ THE SUBTITLES, KAMI!

How come weeaboos are only ugly ass motherfuckers? I bet there are some semi-attractive weeaboos (like me lol)
I can't believe I used to be such an Otaku/Weeaboo. Now that I look back on it, it was very cringey lol

Every time he cuts the video, I bet you 10 fucking dollars he's catching his breath from talking in that voice non-stop XD
Today kinda sucked. I got out of bed at the ungodly hour of 6:30am to take a shower and get ready for school like I always do during the weekdays. But when I awoke, I noticed something very different. When I got up, I wasn't tired. Not even a little bit. This is very unusual for me as I normally stay up late watching netflix or just simple reading. Last night I was up until 2am because I was watching flithy frank, but I took the good fortune of feeling well rested as a sign that my day was going to be a good one. How wrong I was. When I went downstairs I looked down and I saw that my dog, Clover, was restless. This is very unlike Clover since she is usually quiet and still (she has been like that since she was rescued from her old abusive family). But today, she was pacing. Yes, pacing. There really is no other word for it. She was pacing the kitchen and I thought she might be hungry. But then I noticed she still had plenty of food and water in here bowls (this is also strange as she is known for scarfing down her food). I tried to get her to come to me so i could comfort her if she was upset but she would not listen. She is a loyal dog that listen to commands so I was foolish to just shrug this off. After grabbing a muffin, I headed out to walk to school. On the path I did not cross paths with a single person. I live in a pretty populated town with forests all over the place and there are always folks walking about or jogging in the morning, so I took this to be odd as well. To get to school I have go through one the many forests we have on a dirt path. This is a shortcut to school. I wish I had known that in my underclassmen days of high school because I would not have been late as often. Now I was a senior and we only had 10 days until graduation. Excitement and worry filled the air as everyone was ready to get the hell out of our town and start our future. I was already starting to pack up my things for college. I was reflecting on which books I should bring with me to college when I suddenly was facing a completely naked boy. He must have been around 3 years old and he was just staring at me. I was shocked to say the least. I heard someone shout what must have been his name and he then turned around and ran toward the voice. I sort of just stood there for a moment. I was contemplating if what I saw was real when the boy appeared again. This time with his nude mother. They just walked by me, not even looking at me. I just kept walking on, realizing I would be late to class. I was still re-imagining her sagging tits when I walked into the school parking lot. Everyone was naked. I was shocked. I just stood there. Looking at everyone. Some kids were getting out of their cars and others were walking toward the school. All bare like it was the day they were born. I had never seen anyone naked before so I truly did not know how to react. I then saw my friend Mary, who had just driven up. I ran to her car so I could ask why everyone had lost their minds. When she stepped out, her bright and fair skin blinded me. She was very white with clothes on and now she was showing her body off. How did this not blind drivers. She might as well have been a lightbulb. I don't even want to get started on her tits. I asked her what the hell was going one. But she didn't respond, she didn't even look at me. She just grabbed her stuff and headed toward the school. I looked down to see if I was naked, unsure of myself. I was happy to see I was wearing my jeans, boots, and tank top. Maybe today was national nude day? I couldn't think of any other possible reason. But I had a bigger problem. I started shouting and yelling at people, and no one looked my way or even acted as though they heard me. Unlike many stupid people out there, I faced the reality of the situation. I was either dreaming or dead. I did not have the imagination for such a dream, so I knew I was dead. I had a flashback and suddenly remembered that I had died the night before. I was watching flithy frank when suddenly I took papa frankus advice and I killed myself. So this was death. To walk among the living, she them as they are and to just simply walk among them. Unable to talk to them or be seen. To just watch. Forever. So yeah, today kinda sucked.
LMAO "where are the subtitles"
Is frank asian
this is a dumb video, I happen to be an anime fan, collect swords and knives, can eat with chopsticks, and can speak with a little Japanese.
so I'm classified as a "weaboo"?
just because I don't share the same passion as others?
just mind your own business, and leave other people alone. and stop calling names.
maybe you're jealous because you can't!
I'm ready for the replies too.
wea fxckin buuuus
LMFAO
we'll fuck u up man
It kinda like when people where Indian head pieces and don't know fuck all about the people who wore them, or their culture.
Thanks for teaching me about Weeaboos you taught me a lot as for my Self I Am A Anime Fan.
Self righteous faggots üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Sometimes I want to kill myself. 
but when I see TVFilthyFrank in my sub box...

I just want to kill myself even more.
in Germany there was this guy who walked in a news station with a fake, chokolade bomb while waring a Panda costume. The Police just shot him in the leg and it was done. R.I.P only german weeb-fag.
Naruto sucks
I need to enlighten myself every month with this video
Saw the title. Haven't clicked so fast on a video in my life
My avatar is an real anime :I
What does he mean by taking about realms and bc and shit
Dear Filthy Frank

Thanks for featuring my old and rather embarrassing photo in this video. I was very much a novice cosplayer back then, not to mention I had the worst haircut at the time. Its still surprises me to this day that after all these years that picture wound up in this video. Despite the unsavory circumstances which led to the image being put on Encyclopedia Dramatica in the first place, I've actually come to terms with my image being in this and one other of your videos.  

Sincerely, 
The Yuki Cross girl. 1:03
Ayyy baws.
cant stop watching this video
weeaboos did 9/11
Owning a couple of katanas makes you closer to a weeaboo?? Aw fuck, I thought I was in the clear...
Damn! I feel you man, I also wanted to be Thomas the dank engine
Thomas and Friends is my favorite anime, i love it so much i have a body pillow of every character.

I just wanted a piece of the narrow gauge engine's ass..
i have katanas and samurai swords and i know how to use them im not even Japanese or Chinese
Hiroshima probably had the best ending of any anime
my fav anime is cs:go case opening episode 2
Wait, if you were 15, had a foam sword from bleach, and had you're head on mostly straight, would you be a pedophile weeaboo?


I'm uhh... just asking for a friend.

HOLY SHI7. Your Japanese accent is real good. I mean,you sound like a japanese voice actor.
Lol those damn filthy weaboos
You can go from a weeb to a legitimate fan of Japanese culture. If I can do it, so can you.
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Otaku Academy, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Anime series, and I have over 300 confirmed jutsu moves.

I am trained in Anime warfare and I‚Äôm the top ninja in the entire otaku armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Naruto agents across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, weaboo. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands.

Not only am I extensively trained in ninja combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Otakon convention and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it.

You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.
now im no expert, i mean look at my avatar Im guilty clearly, but i think you said something about dead people in your closet?
"A borderline pedophile" :D
My friend recently got a body pillow with an anime dude on it. Do the symptoms get any worse or is it too late for her?
I like to spend money on guns for my wall, what does that mean?

Does having an overrated anime as a profile pic mean ur a weeaboo? Cuz fuck dat guy who said I'm a weeb for having an overrated anime as a profile pic
I'm a hygienic person who likes to watch Naruto dubbed who thinks almost all international cultures including Japan but I am not a weeaboo. I know how to use chopsticks and forks and knives. I typed this at a moderate speed. I am not salty. You are making some good points. I know pretty much nothing about Japan nor do I have a body pillow. I don't care if you make fun of anime. I have a natural hair color. Btw HOW DARE YOU FUCKING MAKE FUN OF MY WAIFU FUCK YOU BITCH DONT CROSS ME!!!! Lol
Am i considered a weeaboo if i'm Asian?

You know your friend is going down the path of weeaboo-ism when if you call them a weeb, they get really defensive and say that calling them a weeb is offensive and that they are an "otaku" or whatever.
But Frank, you are WEEABOO TOO,
I take offense to this
Pfft. My favorite anime is King of the Hill.

I hate it when people call me a weeaboo. I wear anime t-shirts and i have a few items. But I keep to myself about it. I don't ever talk about anime with anyone unless I'm asked about it. I don't try to speak Japanese and I don't cosplay either. This video made me laugh my ass off because of how true it is.
Use subtitles at 1:05
Tickle my asshole with butter
"i've had so much sex with my bodypillow it stands on it's on now" oh ok then
Do you watch SuperMinecraftKid Animated? It's the best anime of all.

I recently went to a bbq , hosted by my boss, and there was lots of big butch guys from work there,
 and no one was commenting about how I looked , I thought I was blending in rather well
     until my boss said , in a really loud voice ,( He had been drinking )that I looked like Woody , from Toy Story, 
some of the guys agreed with him , ; obviously brown nosing !
   I was wearing jeans and my "cowboy " shirt
Tell me if I should be pleased or sad

my favorite anime is Strike witches and akuma no riddle
What ever he's on, I need it.
I used to have an anime avatar, but then I changed it to furry.
Filthy Frank sounds like PewDiePie and iiJericho had a baby
That intro fucking killed me
My friend always calls me Caitlynn-chan and I really hate it. Considering I'm not Japanese. I enjoy anime, but I don't go crazy and get body pillows (just ew) And then she uses words like "Sugoi" "kawaii" "yandere"  "baka" and "senpai" without knowing what they mean. If you are reading this (Amy), I just want you to know you are a disgrace to the Japanese culture. Good day.
Damn filthy frank sounds like the Japanese Morgan Freeman
Prejudice equality. i love it.
Thomas the tank engine was lit
why do I love this shit so much
The Filthy Frank fanbase has turned what used to be a funny video into an overused pile of shit that makes me want to twist my nuts off.

Can someone explain the end card image? The "let's get some pussy tonight" part? I've been watching most of George's videos for some time, but I just don't get it. Is it the logo on the jacket? The fact the person is small/a kid? I have to know.
Who doesn't like Cory in the house
Sir Francis of the Filth, you good sir get it. Everyone should follow Sir Francis' example.
also the fact ppl(weeaboos) think japanese ppl speak like this is cuz of anime and how when characters in anime talk they talk with so much emotions also frank this is the first vid i watched of u is something wrong with ur voice or r u doing it on purpose cuz its hilarious and im sorry if i offend u
4K virgin weebs lmao

My favourite anime is called 9/11
Has anyone watched Kiznaiver? Good stuff.

Kill me
But Franku, weebs don't have keyboards.
I watched 6912369 animes to this day, the 3598614th one being Boku no Pico,
I survived Boku no Pico,
I watched 3 animes from every type of hentai,
I had sex with more than 100 white hair lolis,
I bought 420 ultra ecchi anime posters covering my entire apartment with my money I got for working in an anime shop in Japan,
Does that make me a weeaboo ? ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I love this and all, but is the Jones music the ChinChin music?
WHITE DAD!!!!!
does filthy frank actually speak japanese
prejudice equality i laughed so hard i nearly cried
this keeps me going
Hundreds of weeaboos have killed themselves over this video, together we can improve this and kill more.

there's a weeaboo in my school
I actually fucking love you
Am i a weaboo? 
I want to learn japanese to watch anime.
Has anyone else noticed how rabbits always look like they're 2mins away from death? Even when you pick them up and hold them and stroke them they're eyes are wide open in paranoia.
My parents came into my room while i was watching porn.
I switched to this because it's easier to explain.
I have a anime profile picture but I don't cosplay or buy a shit ton of manga I like to read it sometimes though, I don't try to talk like I'm in anime (unless its funny) would I still count as a weeb cause I'm confused about this
My favorite anime is deadpool.
good thing I use headset when watching this video XD
anime sucks dick
Weeaboo most likely watch subtitled hentai.
You can't make fun of anime !!!! XD 
Anime is laif and waifu AGHHH YES  !! !! !!
The ending montage was very depressing.
I hate weeaboos
#MagnificentBastards
Holy shit!!! Gabe newell is a fuckin weeaboo 1:01
at which part does it say rosetta stone
oi
I don't think I belong here, I know I'm cancerous. But I know I'm not Japanese. I AM TRIGGERED ( I can't type this without laughing)
im the 4k people who disliked this video for being offensive
Weeaboos-the reason this video got 4k dislikes.
That montage made me uncomfortable
I think the error what people do is they think that someone with a Anime profile picture is Weeaboo. Some people even do not know the actual definition, even thought Frank clearly stated that watching/loving Anime doesn't make you Weeaboo.
(Frank is also a character, so you should not take his words seriously)
I prefer Teletubbies but Cory in the house was exquisite
you see, from what I know, a weeaboo is not just for the culture of Japan, but really for any culture.
I'm half Japanese, and I grew up knowing the culture and the language of Japan because of my mom's side of the family. I grew up in the U.S., and still live in the U.S., and growing up with both cultures... something in me just rages whenever I encounter any sort of weeaboo situation. Not just because of how non-Japanese people see them, but also because of that feeling you get when you're actually a part of something, and that something is a part of you, but some ignorant people who don't even know how that feels just obsess over it, and act like they know a lot. Look. If you didn't grow up knowing the language, and every word doesn't come naturally to you in your mind, it's hard to understand the language. I mean, you can learn another language later, but it won't feel as personal to you as your first language. Also, cultural references. In things like anime, jokes or references that only Japanese people would get, wouldn't make sense to an outsider, and jokes, a lot of times, get lost in translation. It bothers me that many people don't fully understand it, and can't fully enjoy it, yet they obsess over anime anyway. Wow. That was a lot of typing. I feel like I can rant forever about this, but I need to stop.
My friend is a weaboo
Now I never got a katana collection or anything, but I used to collect a bunch of toy lightsabers when I was 7 years old (as seen in profile pic). What does that make me?
Fun Fact: I can't use chopsticks for shit
you need to address the bronie epidemic, this shit is getting way out of hand
My favorite anime is the Hindenburg disaster.
I personally hate attack on titan
turn captions on at 1:09 it says in your ball sack
Damn can't wait for Cory in the House reboot.
Dude your voice does not sound good. I think you may develop nodes or have throat issues if you arent already. I mean the appeal of your voice is there, i like the sound of your voice. Just the way you are making your sounds with your throat does not sound healthy and makes my throat hurt listening to you make this scratchy airy tone. Still like your vids just sayin :P hope you dont have problems like that
I promise that that 4k dislikes are actual weeaboos
your japanese seemed on point cuh
fuck im uncle came in my room when he was making that Japanese girl screaming..shit
Dang 10 mil views
hey frank, does it count if it's replica of a game/anime sword?
Anime is dumb.
Was that a calculator you were typing on at 3:24...?
What song starts playing in the background @ 6:00?
lol 4 k dislikes ? wtf what are weaboos doing here
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills.

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.

You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
i have 1 question how the fuck can you not bath atleast 4x a week but 4x week just once you would smell like dog shit

Salamander man makes me uncomfortable.
When I was little I use to be a weeaboo like big time but now I'm not

You're the most honest person. Ever.
I don't know Japanese that well, but the subtitles do not match...
I bet the 4k dislikes are fucking weeaboos
God I hate weeaboos
Basically what filthy frank said at the start was, is that has two dead Jews in his closet
Is his voice really like that O.o wtf.

"Prejudice equality, everyone gets shit here."

the shit gets intense when you realize that weaboo jones is walking like an anime delinquent!
Lol, Rosetta Stone
"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but I'll always be one step ahead of you." Fucking brilliant.
What the fuck are those subtitles for the outro...
Funny, my dad has NOTHING TO DO with Japanese culture yet he has a buunch of samurai swords in his collection. Like he takes a special liking to them. So collecting japanese weapons isn't really that much of a red flag, at least if you're already a weapons conneseaur
10:09 was a weeaboo and a brony im cryin'
my favourite animes are documentaries on Hitler
Your voice is so annoying it gives me a head ache.. XD but still ur funny üòÇüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÇ

Reality check? More like "reality rekt."
YAMETE !!!!
You are my new role model
Fucking bakugan
The most superior anime is obviously Jay Jay the Jet Plane.

Weeaboo or Furries?
Katanas suck ass compared to european swords
Do a video with koreaboos and then do weaboos vs koreaboos

So I turned on the subtitles. 100% accurate yes.

middle school and highschool are breeding grounds for these annoying fucks
7:30 *My same reaction to weeaboos*
This got me dying
I used to have a similar problem when I was in a James Bond-mode.....fucking hell....I must have acted as a jackass....
i have my own wpc (weaboo protenction chamber)
I honestly don't know whether to like the video or rip my hair out. XD
If I'm learning Japanese through a tutor does that make me a weeaboo? I'm learning it to study abroad there. I've only watched a few anime, and I think they are really cool. But I don't try to act Japanese. I don't think I'm a weeaboo, but I'm not 100% sure
Frank i know you're funny ...but you would be funnier if you stopped looking at yourself in the camera
There was this weeaboo that wore attack on Titan shirts all day and read manga all day
I'm dyingüòÇ
The only anime thing in my room is an attack on Titan poster...... Don't talk shit about attack on titan.... XD
My favorite anime is 9/11
"„Éè„É≠„ÄÅ„Éû„Ç§ „Éç„Ç§„É† „Ç§„Ç∫ „Ç´„Ç¶„Éú„Ç§ Áî∞‰∏≠" LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
Weeaboos are even worse than illegal immigrants

Where are the subtitles?
i feel ya

My favorite anime is Attack On Titan, wait that was wrong...
Did somebody say anime avatars?
There is 66,6XX comments total at the time of this comment. And that closing slide show alone is a worthy cringe compilation.
THE WEEABOOS ARE COMING
https://youtu.be/OFQQALduhzA?t=7m55s
The fact that this has 4k dislikes is hilarious
if I was them I'd be burning all of that anime shit XD
ayyee b00s
I'll admit, anime is pretty good, but if you spend most of your money and life on body (sex) pillows, anime weapons (which you will never use), anime outfits, and completely denounce your own culture and value the Japanese culture more, you are clearly wasting your one life that you have. I know people are free to live however they want, but there's a limit to where you're living a good life, and where your life is complete grade A shit.
First frank vid funny as fuck
My favorite anime is breaking bad
Fucking weeobose vergins
Fuck anime
my first filthyFrank video. funny funny shit
Liking anime is not at all bad.
Being obsessed with it, now that's a problem.
Does wanting to learn Japanese because I'm interested and occasionally cosplaying make me a weeaboo?
This is my first video that I've watched of filthy frank. This is fucking hilarious. Subscribed.
My favorite anime is spongebob




And no I am not an idiot,i am just expressing my feelings
Even tho he's talking about weeaboos, his japanese his pretty smooth
xD this was the first video ive seen of him
my favorite anime was the holocaust
im not weeboo im otaku
I've seen them every where
hahahaha! Great vid as usual, Frank! I spend a fair amount of time in Japan since my wife is Japanese, and I see these 'weeaboos' sometimes around Osaka. The funny thing is, the Japanese totally ignore them. They are like a joke. I can speak Japanese myself, but I don't try to act like them. And the thing is, I have a ton of friends there who hang out with me rather than the recent influx of weeaboo scum. It is actually quite funny. The weebs get pissed too when this happens. I love it.
Cory in the house is overrated , Drake and Josh was the best
Hey, I have to admit, I'm borderline pedophile. Hehe.
Wow subtitles really don't like this video. XD
I hate you for cussing
I bought 2 katanas + a katana rack to hang on my wall for decoration lol

I was choking and trying to breathe from exsessive laughter. On a side note though, I really wouldn't mind buying Japanese weapons for like a collection or something. They're pretty cool.
Papa Franku sounds like a daddy when he speaks Japanese.
keep in mind commenters üòÉ
trying to copy frank by telling your favourite anime shows or series that are not actually animes wont make u a superhero or a funny person

it will just make you look like a complete retard üòÑ
I love you dude your fucking awesome and funny as shit. üåüüåüüåüüåü
If those weeaboo's want a place where they can come together.

Auschwitz is currently empty
my favorite animes are smashmouth and Winnie the Pooh
They should change the definition of weaboo to if you watch anime, speak in chopped up mispronounced Japanese, you qualify as a weaboo.

He sits behind me and this all happens in health class in my school... Please... Help me, I'm scared...
Why I started watching anime
1. Filthyfrank- weeaboos
2. Pewdiepie- what not to wear on a date
3. Danisnotonfire- anime will ruin your life

My favourite anime are 'The Filthy Frank Show' or 'Donald Trump The Movie'
I can't help but feel that theres some deep FilthyFrank lore that we're not getting.
We're everywhere heavy breathing

"There are two Jews inside my closet... They're both dead."

The Dislikes must be Weeaboos.
Irk b0ss
that guy at 9:48 looks like the weeaboo that tried to take my gf a few years ago lmfao
You sound like Pew die pie
You know, the word weeaboo in Japan is actually a massive insult as they contribute nothing to society and are frowned upon.
this video reminded me to start my greek lessons.
rip I also wanted to be Thomas The tankengine
My favourite anime is 1 Maniac 1 Icepick.
I speak japanese look: ALLAHU ACKBAR it means hi friend in chinese
From experience, I can say, the best tool for learning about Japan is Google Street View.
i want to be like you shempai

I NEED THE WEABOO PROTECTION CHAMBER MUSIC.
my favorite anime is bee shrek test in the house!

my fav anime is CW The Flash
im going to japan in October and im so excited, but my brother is a fucking weeaboo he owns katanas and kimonos and wears them around the house.

Did i mention hes 11, please someone kill me.

He speaks random sentences that isn't Japanese but he thinks it sound Japanese so he just yells in gibberish, and when i tell him its no real Japanese he gets pissed at me. And when hes not speaking gibberish hes doing a fake accent or dressing up.

Once he asked me to do his makeup like a geisha, and i tried to tell him its for women but he insisted, i think hes transitioning. 

4 a while he wanted everyone to call him Izackoo, his name is Issac.

yes i watch anime and stuff but im not a fucking weeaboo.

I just have one question, AM I GONNA REGRET GOING ON THIS TRIP?!!??! 

This is not even half of the cringey weeaboo BULLSHYT hes done, if he wants to be Japanese i just hope he knows he has brought dishonor to the famory.  

PLZ HALP I BEG OV YEW!
my fav anime is Dora the explore
my friend isva weeabo and hates when I call her that
You are gay
Scrollin' through dem comments, half the peeps have anime avatars.
I have a list of anime I enjoy watching:

Cory engine
Cory gets a job
Cory x Cory
Cory Japanese
Coruto
Cory and 7 bishes 
Love to Cory

See, I'm a anime watcher as well!!!!!!!
9:08 I don't necessarily call that a Weeaboo. That's just an Excalibur... If it is a Weeaboo, it might be Excalibur from Soul Eater, who knows.
My first FF video...  subscribed
I AM FUCKING PISSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Filthy Frank... +1 fan
Can some one please explain to me what the shit I just watched...üòê
screw collecting weapons, I just make 'em.
Heh.
I feel you man, CORY IN THE HOUSE IS THE SHIT
My favorite anime is Anne Frank's Diary
Most of the vid is on point, except for the cosplay part. I don't think that people who cosplay are weeaboos just because they like acting as the character. I correlate that with an actor like Robert playing Tony Stark. But when (anime) lovers think they know it all and/or disrespect either their own or Japanese culture, then that is where they are being weaboos
I'm personally proud of my Japanese heritage, and a lot of my friends know it. At school, though, when one of those guys wearing an anime t-shirt with a tail hanging from their belt loop comes up to me and starts talking about Japanese culture like they know what they're on about... nah, man, I'm Irish.
my favorite anime and drink is Bleach
Whell, im dead, if a bounty hunter/ contract killer comes to my door, now u know üñïüèª
one of the guys in the weeaboo song looks like PBG who is a really funny gamming channel
filthyfrank is weeaboo confirmed
my favorite anime is furry asmr

thanks I've been wondering what a weeabo is
There's no way in hell Frank is 52.

When he says rosetastone I can't help but laugh XD
anime sucks ass its good some times like sponge bob or some shit but not all full out
My sister PC avatar is a avatar comparison
This avatar comes from a Nintendo game called Fire Emblem. Do I still count as a weeb?
My favorite anime movie is Columbine Zero Hour
lol@weaboo jones when he uses sharingan
I don't know if im happy or sad but this was posted on my birthday
I mean I like anime but shit me and my friends call each other weeaboos but shit people really do that shit?!?
If I wasn't asian I would be a weeaboo. Close one genes.
4:10 just killed me
I'm sorry, I have throwing stars and kunai knives. Not for weeaboo reasons, just for the purpose of throwing them at wood boards, because trust me, throwing knives is hella fun.
yea I have a manga profile so I don't count haha

Lol that was offensive, i admit weeaboos do take anime and manga too far, but there are also otaku, with this vid you kinda dissed both otaku and weeaboo, i dont take it personally, just wanted to point it out. Cya!
fucking press 4 and make sure you have headphones because youll see
don't worry one day you will be a dank engine
ey b0ss
hehe. He said 13yo clever papa.
lmao
wtfüòÇüòÇ
Weeaboos ruined anime for me
I watched this video like 30 times to this day
REALITY CHECK!!
Where are the new videos?
BOSS!!!
I'm a japanophile
So basically if your ugly and try to cosplay your a weeaboo? Come on frank.
He sounds like a retarded Marlon Brando
im a full on disgusting, unhygienic white man who doesnt even really watch anime, well except for hentai
Ew... Anime.... the only bad thing to emerge from the fallout of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
My favorite anime is the cinematic Overwatch trailers
Well,I collect weapons to prepare for the apocalypse.
"Hello, my name is, Cowboy Tanaka" hahahahaha I'm dead üòÇüòÇüòÇ
im dead
This is not funny, people just make themself look so stupid just to be "funny" for people! This is not funny at all. I didn't laugh once, and you should unsubscribe to these kind of people or don't even subscribe to them. When people make fun of animals or hurt them or even swear to them to be funny. They get into stupid clothes and act like they have no brains. This video was just about talkin about anime and trying to tell people that they like anime, there was about 30 "Rasengun" words and most of the video was just screaming and making loud noise. I think they just made fun of what people like. So just don't laugh at these kind of people. They make money by running around and screaming and most of us goes to work every day and work really hard to get money but these people just make money so easily. Thank you for reading...
my favorite anime is dragonball evolution
anime is garbage
there is so much cancer in the comment section oh my god.

That guy approving of feminism because of his body pillow, this is what I have to say about him. I am a black walrus/African penguin/classified as a Canadian refrigerator that loves me some gays so fuck me in the ass Donald Trump. Get roasted son, the only reason why you shouldn't have a Japanese girlfriend is because when you try to break up with her you have to drop the bomb twice for her to notice. LOL funny Hiroshima joke. (No offence to anyone that takes offence, fuck you)

I enjoy anime and I'm Asian, specifically Chinese. But I know enough about the different countries around my country to know weeaboos are nothing like real Japanese citizens. Dumbassess... I hate those male weeaboos that go up to me and ask me my ethnicity and hope I'm a little hentai dream girl
When I grow up I want to be a rapist.
KCUS SOOBAEEW

What the fuck did you just fucking say about my waifu, you little faggot? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Kawaii Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret trips to Japan, and I have over 300 confirmed animes watched. I am trained in marathon watching and I‚Äôm the top weeaboo in the entire US faggot forces. You are nothing to me but just another nerd. I will speak Japanese to you with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my kawaii words. You think you can get away with saying that about my waifu over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of weeaboos across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the Boku No Pico, maggot. The Boku No Pico that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You don't even speak Japanese, kid. I can watch any anime, any time, and I can watch it in over seven hundred positions, and that‚Äôs just with my television. Not only am I extensively trained in waifu arguing, but I have access to the entire Japanese anime stocks and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your waifu's miserable ass off the face of her anime, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon your waifu, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Your waifu is dead, kiddo.

Now... I wouldn't say I'm a weeaboo... but I'm 24 or somethin' (I don't keep track), an' I collect machetes, can't draw for shish (profile pic is proof o' this), and I'm a total failure at life with no purpose. Well, I'm close enough to a weeaboo, anyway. Still liking this video and the show tho', fuck et.

Damnit I got a crunchy roll add right before this vid.      THE WEEBS ARE COMING!
i feel special because i understood a little bit of that intro
I love how he translated really nicely in the begging.. he doesn't have anyone in his closet or something..
"Welcome everyone. Welcome to the filthy frank show. Today I'm going to teach something really good. There are 2 Jews in my closet. They are both dead."
ok um... Im dumb... He's all those characters.... I suddenly got the feelings hes really lonely..
wait wait wait wait.... I though pink guy was someone completely different.... he's pink guy?!?!

Family Guy is my favorite anime
Whether you like anime or not, you have to agree that it's freakin weird

glad i changed my friends from weeaboos to normal people.
I want to believe the the dude at 9:58 is posing for a joke, cause he looks normal, but I just can't.
"Dad, what was your job when you were younger"? Frank: uhh......
THAT PIGEON WAS A WEEABOO!!
Owning a katana makes you a weeaboo? Because you like the design of it more than another European sword? I realize using Rosetta Stone isn't the best way to learn Japanese but couldn't it be a stepping stone to a college/unit class? 
Honestly curious. Yes I use an anime girl for my avatar because...I like anime? Not a bad thing yeah?
vomit porn
was he actually speaking Japanese
This shows the worst of the worst. I mean i watch anime in all that but...those pictures at the end make me want to kill myself.

I was about to say "those damn weebs" then looked and said ".....well fuck"
"But not as bad as a fucking weeaboo" that was the best part of the whole video
I don't get the Cory in the house is anime meme can some one explain
4 thousand weeaboos disliked this
Damn has it really been 2 years? This video is a classic
okay and,what about DC and marvel hardcore fans that's collecting expensive figures and buy a lot of comics? American weeabos
Best! Literally... Best. Just best..
So these people that'll defend anime with their life are basically keyboard warriors?
please make fun 
of scene kids and emos
If there was a FilthyFrank anime it would probably be the only anime i would watch,Fuck all those 13 year old fangirls who write SAO fanfics
Game of Thrones is the only hentai I need.
Excuse me, Papa Frank...I found out that I was going to Japan and so decided to really buckle down and learn about Japan. I enjoy watching anime, listening to Japanese songs and reading things of the like to practice, but whenever I listen to music and things around people I know, they call me a 'weeb'. I'm worried that I'm becoming one. I don't want you to pity me or anything, but I really need you to tell me what I'm turning into. (Sorry for having a Vocaloid avatar, I don't know if that counts...)
I had to evacuate my house because all of these truth bombs being dropped
I feel really guilty for knowing all of what he's saying in japanese xD
Makes me feel like an actual weeaboo lol
The guy next to me in my class rn got so offended by this. I win "Spot the Weeaboo" lmao
Poor Chikorita

I'd just like to inform you that I learned entirely legitimate Japanese from anime. For instance, I can tell you the 'Sayonara bastards' he said at the end of the video meant in Japanese, 'I am the hippopotamus.'
....god damn what the fuck is this bullshit
When only this guy and Yahtzee are the voices of reason on youtube. Fuck, that's sad
at recess i was sitting by the playground and some weeaboos where playing around acting gay aroind eachother and they where talking about "yandere" or stuff like that and i wanted to go up to them and say MATHEW,RONALD you guys are......FFFFFAAA..
Stares at machete collection... I ain't gotta problem
I have a theory: Weeboos are Japan's way of retaliation for us dropping atomic bombs on them.
Cory in the house is not an anime!!!

living ichigo : weeaboo of lisps
Star wars is best anime

Watching the weeaboo song makes me want to commit seppuku
lol The beginning where he's speaking Japanese. If only you guys understood what he was actually saying. xD
10 mil views.... Holy shit
Nothing gives me a hard on like Franku speaking Jap
i have a confession to make... i'm not proud of it but... i was once weaboo scum... but i saw the light and it dragged me forcefully out of being such a cancerous being.. never give up hope... the cure for being a weaboo is close
Pleas frank no Dont you think us anime fans have taking enough bull poop. You seem like an ok guy but dont do this ok. Please just kill yourself. just why would u do this i dont UNDERSTAND why someone would do this. I was going through enough before this. now all my classmate hate anime all because of you. I hate you. One day u will get what you deserve BITCH!
My favourite anime is Thomas the tank engine! Boy I love Percy!
Is it bad that I understood everything he said?
Filthy Frank the anime
At 9:28 I remember this EXACT moment and those uniforms belong to the Houston Police Department. So this guy was dressed up as some Naruto dude and was harassing some girls that were just kind of skimming the place out. So one of the girls he's stalking like talks to an officer and the officer is like, "Come on man, I understand how you feel but you can-" and like he puts his hand on the guy's shoulder in a friendly man-to-man way, and he like goes into maximum over-autist and like starts to attack the officer. He then got punched in the face and body-slammed.
out of every noise frank makes, apparently my mom only hears the moaning
I was gonna go jack off till I noticed flithyfrank talking Japanese
WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST WATCH? ......O.o
FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS. IF YOU'RE DIFFERENT THEN BE PROUD.
I actually don't have a prob with weebs. Like what you want to like, do what you want to do. I just hate those "haha, you suck because you like this [insert fandom], I like [insert anime]! They're better!" I once saw this one weeb bad mouthing a furry when he actually had a body pillow himself.
Never take your fandom seriously, bro. Just relax.
Franku is the best anime character
the cringe... It's killing me from inside...
On the real though, Toy Story is a fucking great Enema
dude. thank god I'm an otaku. 
I got  scared there for a minute.
how high are you when you make videos
thank god I'm not a weeboo, weird fucks.
Filthy Frank, your videos are complete shit. I fucking hate every one of them. This guy has to be an autistic retard. It's funny how everyone watches his videos and he gets paid. That's fucking bullshit. If you made quality videos than this account wouldn't be created. Wait a fucking minute. In the suggested videos it says "MAC IS BETTER THAN PC" No. Please. Just. Fucking. Stop. Apple computers are absolute shit. Windows are by far the master race. Linux is eh, but I'll take it over Mac. You should get kicked out of your apartment for all the noise complaints. It'd do you and the channel good. I see that you like playing with mouse traps. I got an idea for a video, why don't you take five of them and put them on your dick? That'd be "Hilarious and Original" Fuck off. Btw, this better make it into loser reads hater comments 5. Fucking piece of shit.
I think this guy is a weebo 



weebo confirmed
Bro, you're preaching in this.
IM BRATHING REALLY HAVE AND TYPING SO FUCKING FAST IN ALL CAPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My favourite anime is Batman vs Superman
Holy shit. I used to hate you so much because I thought you were some trashy asshole. But no. You are one of the funniest cunts on this platform and you make satire of issues. My misinformed view of you was because of a former friend who would religiously quote memes about you nonstop like a fucking manic child. Fast forward to now when we're out of high school and I'm in my second year of college and he still acts like a child.....memes.....memes never change. But anyways I've started watching your videos and when I read your description of your channel it did resonate with me. So thanks for the laughs and good satire.
he speak of da truth
My favorite anime is Shrek
I <3 jap.

Dude Yesss!!! 
Where have you been homie!!!
üòÇüíñüòÇüåå
When I was younger I wanted to be myself too.
One of my friends irl plays Hyperdimension Neptunia obsessively, has a waifu, and gets really defensive whenever the word "weeaboo" is even mentioned. 

Should I be worried?
I just found this channel, and it's probably the strangest set of videos I've watched ever
Death to all weeaboos
weabos are cancer to the planet and global warming is the chemo

My favourite anime was ur moms 80's photos
my favorite anime¬¥s are Hitler¬¥s Speech about Jews and ISIS Executions. those are really good anime¬¥s
I don't get why attack on Titan is so overrated it is barely half as good people say it is. But I think if you cos play once as long as you never do it again. And I know that my profile pic bieng an anime character kinda goes against my words but you know what I'm saying I hope

People with minecraft avatars should just shower with a toaster
yoooo these are so true hahaha
Frank, why are you not a Japanese voice actor?
Yeah, I never understood why some people make anime the focal point of their life. I watch anime, but I watch other stuff too, and I don't just sit around watching stuff all day. What's so hard about that? It's no wonder they jump your shit, since anime is all they sleep eat and breathe.
tbh a lot of weeaboos come from Japan üòÇüòÇ
my favorite anime was WWII anti Japanese us propaganda
I have 3 weaaboos in my school :( (yeah,they smell like shit)

gay
kek

You know... when a man that lives in Japan and speaks japanese very well (japanese is fucking hard to learn, keep that in mind) tells you to stop doing japanese shit...
maybe you have a problem
1:05 voice crack lol
Thank you for making this video. I have an art academy at my school and it is a bunch of weeaboos. They make me want to die
when was the epidemic of people photoshopping  themselves with badly drawn anime characters bc I die everytime. memories.
i want a katana because katanas are badass... i don't think anything is wrong with that lol
oh shit... well dw i love being indian so dw frank I'm validated. insecurity intensifies
Cough, Cough
My favorite anime is Men Behind the Sun.
half the teen cunts who watch are weebs
The only animes I watch are Yokai watch and Pokemon, RWBY doesn't count
My favorite anime is probably Keeping up with The Kardashians, obviously
yes, it finally hit 10 million...
Talks to friends about future life goals

I state that I plan on exploring the world a bit, and intend to go to France, Britain, Germany, Poland, Austrailia, and Japan, and learn their cultures, then probably return and start teaching history and/or culture

Gets called a dirty weeaboo
4K weeaboos are coming for frank with cheesy finger and katanas

gayy assss hater
My favorite anime is 1876 pictures
What's the problem with collecting weapons?
Hell, it's the centerpiece of history, however unfortunate it is.
Weapons are art, and a testament to the engineering knowledge of a given era.
I don't even like anime.
WAS THAT MCR ON THE RECORDER LOL
my favourite anime is thats so raven
my favorite anime is urotsukidoji: legend of the overfiend :)
This was the first video i saw of papa franku, and i actually thought this channel was Japanese dubbed and english subbed lol
My favorite anime is The Cold War and Snoop Dog
I wish I could marry you
that Arizona tea
"this is my house"
Cory in the house is the only good anime
so anyone know the song at 6:41? just curious.
"We support prejudice equality..."

My highschool quote.
My favorite anime's are Shrek, The bee movie, cory in the house, drake and josh, and ICarly.
My favorite manga is karma sutra
9:53 OH GOD BURN IT WITH FIRE! ! ! ! üò±üò±üò£üò£üò£üî•üî•üî•üî•
FUck You I AM jPaanes
The picture at 9:46 is quite intriguing. The girl's face is actually quite pretty... it's just that she's morbidly obese and wearing very little, which makes it disturbing.
This is my house
Cory in the house is my favorite anime!
He didnt say ready to have fun. He said there two jewish people in the closet when he said sure i am he auctally said they are dead
attack on Cory is my favorite
I'm Japanese and even I think I'm a WEEABOO üò¢ I have shamed my famiry
fuck weaboos I love SpongeBob
OH EM GEE!!!1! HOOW DARE YOU MAKE FUN OF MY LIFE STYEL ITS NOOT LIEK I JUDGE YOURS !!!11! BUT HAVE FUN WITH LIFE SWEATY !!!111
my favorite Japanese cartoons consist of:documentaries on terrible diseasesold pornos from the 80sthe thought that every breath I take, every second I live on this earth are all worthless to everyone, everything around me, so I think watching shit like frank's videos will cure me, but it only makes it worse. the 3 little pigsgay pornetc, etc
right before 1:05 franks voice cracked
3:53 I don't know shit about Japanese but: Kore wa boku iera?
SNORT SNORT HEAVY BREATHING INSECURITY INTENSIFIES GOOGLE TRANSLATE USAGE 100% BODY PILLOWS ARE SO SAMA!!!! sama means kawaii you idiots. (little did dumb bitch #38463837584 know... she was wrong... she just called body pillows bastards... the japanese then raped her manga collection until only that shitty soccer manga was left... she then took a plastic sword she bought on ebay for $300 that her mom gave her to get out of the closet. she used to sword as a dildo then just shot herself... what? you thought she was gonna cut herself? no thats emo... not weeaboo but they're WAY too similar.
If you're offended by this video then you're probably a weeaboo. There's no justification to your umbrage.
my favorite anime is WWll nazi documentaries .
FilthyFrank: Wanna know a joke? Weeaboos go to Japan and ask "Where are all the subtitles?"
Me: lol XD

my endorsement
Yeah...anime sucks here comes the hate
collect swords but I'm not a weeaboo because I actually know how to use them
10:12 10:21 Anyone got a sturdy rope?
my fav anime was 9/11

too bad it was canceled after the first episode
That was... interesting to say the least. Found this when just generally looking for people's views on anime. It has some points on people who take it too far.

Also I think it's fine to own swords if your a martial arts practitioner
You fukun put the subtleties at the start wrong you did that on purpose wink lol go fuk u self ‚Ä¢___‚Ä¢
I actually want a sword, I wouldn't use it for anything either. I would just have it, it would be a waste of money but hey, I can decapitate you. No really decapitate more like cut a sleeve off of your shirt, but if you have a sleeveless shirt, I'll cut the bottom of your shirt. Unless your shirtless, then I would say fuck you and try to cut you when in actuality I missed 10 times and you walked away out of boredom. So don't mess with me, you weeb!

Dragon ball is my favorite TV Drama...Wait.. Its an anime...No..NOO...NOOOOOO!!!
A couple of weeks ago, I was looking at my feed and this guy with a Japanese name and a Naruto profile picture comes up. My  first thoughts were 'oh no... this can't be....'  I looked at the comments on one of his posts and he had said 
'I am from america, but I really wish I lived in Japan ya know? But please call me Japanese, because I basically am Japanese'

And I died of laughter.
Turns out theres a whole community of these 12 year old Naruto weeaboos.
he suddenly felt defensive to the pigeon
How the fuck this video get 10 million view when there are only 7 million of people on this planet?!
My mos always tells me that I like to watch american stuff and I act so western and that im not "japansese" enough. I dont know if im a reverse weeaboo or if my mother is just insane.

:21 hilarious
My favorite anime is the amazing bulk, seriously those weeaboo fags that like the amazing hulk are idiots because thats a rip off of the amazing bulk. The best manga is definitely web m.d. But the best anime is cory in da house.
Why is that someone loves Anime/Manga/Japan, is judged and called a weeaboo.. I mean read the fucking definition. You people that says someone is a weeaboo are fucking ignorant bastards.
my favorite anime is family guy :)                  :D
Isn't Frank Japanese?
That Weeaboo song is beautiful
I speak Japanese fluently and he said shit completely different from the subtitles lmao.
so...if you do a cosplay you're a Weeaboo? ¬∞-¬∞

I hope you cleaned your closet out (‚âß‚àá‚â¶)
Watashino namaewa PJ desu.
Japanese shitty weapons? Who the hell needs those? When my room is full of guns man.
he is half  australian and half japanese , but when i first saw him , i though he was american , even until now , his behaviour and accent and everything to lifestyle is american , i dont think he's getting outta us , its his home  i guess
Also, all the Weebs be like "Eeyuuu! Eeyuuu!"

And yet here I am stabbing bitches in throat with an Arisaka Bayonet...

Get on my level noobs....
Man fuck you Filthy Frank you sexist pig for not including a woman in your pictures. Women are weeaboos too ya know
Dude my favorite anime is Cory in the House man! We should talk about anime sometime

You're my hero Frank
Oh this is awkward 3:00
now i know what those weird kids were back when i was in highschool. drawing symbols and anime and shit trying to talk japanese when they were actually puerto rican.
When anime has set the Japanese on the road to extinction because their death rate is higher than their birth rate and everyone jerks it to their body pillows instead of making human contact. Don't let this spread to America. #animebodypillowsdestroynations.
Dude, this is my first vid and i Love you already....you now what mean

My favorite anime is south park.
thank you frank for pointing out the difference between weaboos and people who just like to watch anime and dont get creepy about it

Firstly, I have never watched Filthy Frank before and was shown this video. So WHAT THE HELL is wrong with his voice? Does he constantly have a sore throat or is does he just have a really dry voice? I think it sounds painful. Poor guy. Also the video was different. o_o
papa franku he speaks the truth

whats wrong with collecting swords????

Is this supposed to be comedy
Hb
Toy Story and Cory in the House are both really good anime but...
We can't just not mention Dora the Explorer and Teletubbies.
If you haven't seen them, I recommend.
My favorite manga is 'Mein Kampf'
Question: What did Filthy Frank say when he was speaking Japanese at 4:10?
I mean i like anime, and i'm hoping to travel to japan one day. Imma be honest i know the meaning(S) of some japanese words and i do sometimes say the ones i know how to pronounce, but i don't wanna worship japan because of anime. I mean yea japan made some pretty cool stuff, but i like the music, games, and other things here. Japan has maid cafes and a confusing languge which i hope to learn and visit. I dunno. Does it make me a weeb if i like anime, wanna learn japanese, and wanna travel to japan. I still like america though. also i don't try to force anime on someone. If some doesn't like it and at least watched some i'd be fine, but if someone called anime stupid without trying it, i'd probaly hate them for not atleast trying it out.
I love kawaii Chinese anime, my favorite one is "attack on dragon note shippuden"

Sao is a bad anime
The only reason to learn Japanese as a anime fan is to understand without dub or sub. And not from Rosetta Stone or from a  anime
They ruin the anime fandom
I've always wanted to go to Tokio China, it's my favourite japanise city I watched all of the anime and I know more japanise then all of you combined
I mean I like my anime but a least I don't lie to my self that I'm Japanese.

I'm lucky I'm Vietnamese and not a Weeaboo so I can speak Japanese horribly and won't be called Weeaboo...

Really tho, I'm Vietnamese but doesn't even know Vietnamese language so I don't speak Japanese either but I speak Puerto Rican/Spanish
I bet everyone was secretly mentally checking themselves on whether or not they were a weeaboo, just to be safe.
my favorite anime is fox news

If you're saying he's a Weeaboo, you can't because Frank is an Australian-Japanese and he's a fluent Japanese speaker..
10 000 000
You know how conspiracy theorists say crack cocaine was invented by the government to destroy the black community? I think anime was invented to destroy the white community.

Beware of the Phandom.

There were a ton of weebs at the community college I went to for a year. They hung out in the 'cafeteria' for like the whole day pretty much every day of the week.
6:57 is the best part of this video
Don't trust Frank, he intentionally used the wrong subtitles at the start of the video. He actually said:

"There are two foreigners in my closet, they're both dead."
i had a best friend who was a weeaboo and i helped him get cured of weeabooism and i think weeabooism is more of a anti-social disease. 
we can all help cure weeabooism and for over 9,000 dollars a day you can get weeaboos a life an actual life
Kill your local weeaboos and otherkin
Remember, kids! The more you hate it the stronger it gets! It's how the bronies became big (even though a lot of bronies are just flat out cancerous)!

I am a JJBA fan.

What about Swedaboos? (People who think that they're Swedish because they watch PewDiePie)
I only read HUNTER X HUNTER manga
My favorite animes consist of Little Einsteins,
Handy Manny, and Dexters laboratory.
And i'm going to be honest, i watch anime because it has sexier characters than american cartoons
You and grade a under a are my favorite offensive youtubers, and the best part is i laugh at everything that's funny even if it offends me so fuck the weeaboos
Eh, i thought attack on titan was shit, i liked fairy tail, i liked sao, and some others that are inappropriate, but i know some down right weeaboo trash. This girl at my school has a death note necklace she ships literally every anime and she cosplayed as an anime character to school one day.
Just found a new fav channel XD
This is the best first video of a youtuber that I've ever seen (I mean the first video I have seen of the youtuber)

Such quality.
My favourite animes are videos of cops shooting innocent black people.
I want to move to Japan and I am going to do so. Not because I like Anime. I do like Anime, but the main reason I want to move to Japan is because I love the Japanese culture. I am going to move to Japan, get an apartment, get a job, and life a normal life. I just really like Japan. I am being taught Japanese by a teacher along with some other people. I do not learn Japanese from Anime or Rosetta Stone, that would be stupid. For the record, Attack on Titan sucks ass

0:11 Can we talk about the two dead jews in your closet?
Nice Arizona Te Verdes...
Game grumps is my favorite live action anime
Well, this is a very big problem since I'm confirmed only 38% Japanese.
But if I do decide to buy some Japanese Weapons (I was planning to buy a tsurugi or a nodachi, and I do plan to use these to enhance my skills), is this a weeaboo problem or am I not a weeaboo?
The most frustrating thing about liking anime and japan's culture but not being a Weeaboo is when I go to Anime Cosplay Conventions just because I want to see some actual good cosplayers that aren't weeaboos, they're fucking everywhere and each one gives me a different kind of cringe.
I ddidn't know filthy frank was 52
I hate anime,but I love manga.The good old classics like Mein Kampf,fifty shades of grey,and the diary of Anne Frank.So amazing.
Georgie when r u going to do another video with how to basic and maxmoefoe

If I'm Mexican and Japanese and I'm fluent in English and Japanese, am I a weeb? :(
So I am in my second semester of college Japanese class and am actually going to be studying abroad to learn Japanese business, but good God, the amount of weeaboos on my class is god awful. Like, you're spending hundreds of dollars to learn to speak Japanese on a mediocre level just so that you can watch anime without subtitles... So cringey.
can't believe this guy is almost 21.....I thought he was older, at least 25--30....sorry, Frank :I
Are you still a weeaboo if you learn the language for your job as a linguist?

Trolling everyone that doesn't know Japanese üôÉ
I love how all the weaboos disliked this
At the beginning I think he said something like "I have two foreigners in my closet" but subtitled it as "are you ready to have some fun?" Either that or my Japanese is still shit, which I wouldn't argue too much against.
Nice Shirt Man!!

Anime was only good when we were dropping napalm on those fuckers.
Hey bawss
how the fuck did i get here
Anime
i knew he was achian
I love anime and manga, I love the japanese language and I have spent time and effort in learning it. And I do wish to be able to visit Japan one day. But my love for anime and the Japanese language has always been quite moderate. I mean I've never cosplayed (nor do I want to), I do jot own any anime merchandize and I don't go around saying Japanese words. I think that as an anime fan, I might be able to get my message across to some other anime fans who are obsessed with Japan and are 'weaboos'. I think there is nothing wrong with liking anime, but its important to keep your habits in check. People who dont care for their health and hygeine and sit around watching anime and obsessing over it need to realize that tge world is full of so many other interesting things. If you'll spend your whole life watching 2 dimensional people and trying hard to act like them, one day you might wake up and realize...what have I done with my life? You will realize that you never gave importance to what truly matters. People on the internet are so hateful towards such people but I think they need help and attention and loving words like this to be able to change. And they will. Like I said before, I too love anime, but I keep my habits in check and healthy habits dont harm anybody. Cheers! I thought this video was hilarious btw..but the way he speaks is annoying. Nice Japanese though :p
The ISIS excecution tapes is the best anime series by far.
Anime sucks anyway.
Is this his real voice
This is his best video. By far.
Papa Franku should be proud that this video gets referenced on EVERY Weeaboo related discussion
fucking hare weebs
I've seen the first two episodes of Naruto in English. I guess you could say I know everything about Japan now.
"There's a difference people people who like anime, and full on weeaboos!"
And somehow people can't understand this?
help, am scared.
I like guns. I have 2 pistols and 1 rifle
I like guns. I have 2 pistols and 1 rifle
So what does it mean if someone calls you a Weeaboo and you are actually Japanese.

(I don't collect Kitanas, I know how to use chopsticks yet I don't really brag about it,  and overall I feel like every other Japanese-American human being.)
(I was born in Okinawa, Japan if you need the specifics just in case you call me a weeaboo if I was born in like Chicago or some shit)
rosetta stone

DONT LET HIM SCRATCH YOU. AIDS IS POSSIBL√â
I have two weeaboos in a couple of classes and they're two of the most annoying people I know.
They sit right behind me in one class and I can constantly hear them quoting anime and they get all dramatic about it and it drives me crazy (not to mention the second hand embarrassment). I've asked them to pipe down multiple times and they'll be quiet for one blissful minute, but then start it right up again. I'm pretty sure I overheard one of them talking about how she bought a body size pillow of some anime character she's obsessed with and it's pretty damn creepy. It seems every time I'm around them, all I can hear them talk about is Japan and it's really fucking annoying.
i was waiting for him to clear his throat and say "I'm batman!"
this guy is the best.
I don't even watch anime ^-^
thank you... ;) thanks you for making this video
5k WEEABOOS! are disliking the video and breathing heavily!

Wait does it make me bad if I want to move to Japan to train in legit Martial Arts rather than McDojos. I like anime and collect weapons (only ones I know how to use) and want to learn Japanese to live there. But I also want to live in Okinawa for awhile as well. What does that make me?

So there is a girl in my school. I liked her at first, but then she started watching anime, the first phase. After a while she started screaming japanese words through the hallway, phase 2. But then the ultimate phase came. Phase 3. She became lesbian. She wore an attack on titan cape to school and cut her hair. She seeks attention. And every second of the day she can, she kisses her lesboo. I am pretty sure they don't even talk to each other but just kiss. Nobody talks to her and most people try to stay away from her as far as possible. Which is hard since she always runs through the school screaming japanese shit
lol he did his last two subtitles  wrong üòÇüòÇ
Does my avatar count as an anime avatar? lol.

My favorite manga is The Diary of Anne Frank
Hey baws
So if one were to buy katana sets from, say the Edo era in Japan as a sort of collection, would that still be red flag-ish?
I really don't get your argument against collecting weapons, and you calling it a waste of money. A lot of things we buy today are completely unnecessary, so if someone likes collecting weapons they find cool, there is really nothing wrong with it.

Does anyone else find his Japanese hot XD like its so awesome and he has a really deep voice
I don't know if Filthy Frank is trying to make us think that's his real voice, but his laugh sounds like his impressions.
If I have a katana, or a katana collection, but know how to use them and do use them, am I a weeaboo?

I honestly don't like Japan on a political level, denying massacres and comfort woman, they also have "Compensated Dating" which isn't stopped yet because they blame it on the woman not the actual men who pay for it. 
 
I mean people in Mexico aren't any better (My Home) the age of consent is actually 12 in some states, though Japan is close to it which is 13 in all of japan. Really Japan is so disconnected with modern laws and rights. 

  I really have to say if I ever had to go to Japan I would probably enjoy it just like how you would go to mexico ignoring all of its controversy. But praising such a disconnected country from modern rights and views is so mind-boggling that people actually want to be Japanese I mean xenophobic people fill Japan. I am not shaming Japanese people you can judge Mexicans all you want.

  Frank covers some of these topics of the bad of japan and how it isn't this "Perfect Society" everyone claims it to be, and you shouldn't treat it like that.
lmao when he started moaning XDDD
my favorite anime is call of duty.
Who the hell is "Annie May?"
Soo...I enjoy listening to Vocaloid and Utau songs, mostly because I love the idea that synthetic voices can be so well made by Yamaha. Does that make me a weeabu just because I get the songs stuck in my head and have a few on my i pod? What do you think of Vocaloids Filthy Frank? 
PS- I have Ayame as my photo because I am not allowed to have my real face as my profile, so my sister and I whom are watching Fruits Basket chose his.
Manko.
If I were  weeayou.... I'd get a life
His voice is making my throat hurt.

The wrong trousers is the best anime.
Dear Frank,I just want to say your my favourite youtuber.You make me laugh a lot and I love watching your weird/satire videos,Ur awesome,From Brian üòâ
I really like this video, most people just think if you like anime they can call you a weeaboo, but there is a difference between being respectfully interested in a culture and claiming it as your own.
Japanese poeple are weird SRS no offence seen prison school? and Japanese south Korean make fart animations I bet you as much money if U type in UTUBE "fart or fart animation" it will be all Japanese and south Korean THERE SO ANNOYING AND WEIRD

then 6 months later I see him at this anime convention watching a performance (and shouting random Japanese) he was telling me how he was on the stage with the Japanese idols the day before @_@

then another few months later my friend invited me to go to an anime convention that her boyfriend goes to and there he was again!! I tried to say hi to him but I basically got ignored as he went to hang out with some other people who were in cosplay.... -.-

The moment you realize that Francis is legendary.

Weeaboo pride
weaboos are cancer

Frank's jap grammar is good though.
Sup

Holy fuck this has 9 million views already. Time flies when you suck cock.
Fuck off and watch your own shit like gays of thrones, you fucking white trash faggot pedophile creep
TVFilthyFrank is my favorite anime....
I like attack on titan that's it and that only once in a blue moon when I feel the need to pay one doll or for porn I couldve scoured the internet for but the shit this guy goes through its just you can hear him dying inside but he had to keep a straight face
8:37 WEEABOO JONES! NOOOOOOOOOO!
actually having swords and katanas and the like don't make u a weeaboo. it just makes u a sword enthusiast, or a blacksmith or something. it's like how having a gun doesn't make u a redneck.
xenophobic to the point a fucking Shogun closed the country to all non-asian trade and travel, for 250 FUCKUNG years. I go to school with 8 weaboos
I watched tokyo ghoul and tokyo ghoul root as well as attack on titan i am a  japanese pro
I need to kill my weeaboo sides

The Holocaust is the biggest prank in world history.

Things I like that are Japenese1:Anime2:Ramen(cousin introduced me to it)3:Chicken Tempura4:Japan and it's technology 5:Vocaloid

"my wife has come to life"

Do a video on furries
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
There's nothing better than filthy Frank breaking his character at the end
This is my first video I've seen of his. :P Why does he sound like he's growling when he speaks?
so if I'm correct, this channel is a parody if bigoted hateful people?

So does that mean this video is meant to satire/make fun of people who make fun of weeaboos? He's not actually making fun of or hating on weeaboos? He's on the side of the weeaboo?
my favorite anime is Chef
My favorite anime was the halacaust
yet still the break father parker did spill
I like anime, but weeaboos take shit way too far.  Who really wants to sit on their ass then learn the entire fucking Japanese language?  I can understand wanting to learn some martial arts, but pretending you're a 7th dan Dian Wei is just bs.  Katanas are cool, but spending 100s to thousands on them is kinda pointless.  If you're a fan of a show, and wanna collect some merch that's fine too.  Pretending a fictional character is your wife to the point you actually believe it is pure fucking psychosis.  Even race denouncing to pretend your skin is auto-conforming to another's is pointless and pure psychosis too.  I really hate weeaboos.
What anime is 1:18 from?
My favorite anime is Dora the explored
i love the subtitles wow
PENIS.
Im 15 and I have a weaboo in my class
DAMN PIGEONS

What kind of nerd loser would have an anime profile picture? Haha.. Ha..... Oh
rosetta stone
Lol like that's true, like when I say I was born in Japan, all these weeboos starts yelling random Japanese words at me. Like bruh I said born not live. My Japanese isn't as good as it should be but it's a lot better than the people whom studies it and still says it wrong. How does that work? How do you spend 3 weeks learning one word and still say it wrong. Heck I stick to English and Spanish. I don't speak Japanese unless it's a life or death reason and no one speaks English. To be honest Japanese is kind of useless in America. I mean look at how many people actually speaks the language here, little to none definitely in Texas. I get that people like the culture and all but there should be a fine line between liking it and ignorantly obsessed with it... heaven knows I need to say that.

My friends  would be considered the biggest weaboos. They both bought katanas for $25, then they downloaded anime girlfriend apps. That's only the top of reasons they're weaboos.
I wanna move to Japan simply because it's a better fashion industry. JUDGE ME COMMENT SECTION
my favorite anime is called............. bounce physics
I remember watching my first anime,it was the morning of September 11th of 2001.Man,that ending was really sad.I hope they add another season.

I watch anime every couple days to study and I live in Japan and study everyday and go to Japanese school, I'm from Canada and I use rosetta stone... I do know hiragana and katakana and currently studying kanji and grammar. I love traditional Japanese culture and the history of the clans and samurai warriors...I've learned the rules of respect in Japan and I try to use them,, am I a weaboo?
I find it funny that I watch the same "anime's" as Frank. XD
I want to go to japan... But I want to go to see the Mikasa (it is the only Pre-WWI battleship left other than the USS Olympia) and see some of their other military museums.  Perhaps I would also travel to some of the sights of WWII battles on the surrounding islands...
My favorite anime is The Adventures of KIM JONG UN!!!
"rosetta's stone"
Oh my god. This is so true I can't stop laughing. I may want to visit Japan and I do love anime, but I don't go around saying "OHAYO MY TOMODACHI, I AM SO GOOD AT JAPANESE DESU?!" Japan is a must go becuase Mount Fuji looks absolutely beautiful, the people sound like a delight to meet, and even one of my best friends are Japanese. I hate it when people call me a Weeaboo just because I watch anime.
ur so filthy, ugh
i watched the hiroshima now im japanese
LMAO "Lets have some fun everyone" was that? not "I have two dead bodies in my closet"? hm~? LMAO nice sub high fives

Omg I knew a person that was just like that. It was so annoying.
Favorite Anime is Donald Trump discriminating muslims and mexicans. Oh damn, i am getting horny now!
After seeing that ending with the weeaboo song, I had to pray to Shrek for at least 420 hours to be cleansed from that.
That's Some Top Quality Entertainment !
I would feel blessed by Shrek if Papa Franku lived next to me.
My favorite of the hentais is Aldolf Hitler
frank would honestly make a good anime voice actor

Bless... you...
takes last breath after a life full of weeaboos
This was the funniest thing I have ever seen. I love it.
A redneck vergin...OMG
I don't really think weeaboo  are trying to be rude, their just really into their anime and appreciates it's to the extent to where they think of Japanese as their home land, but I do agree don't ever get in a fight about anime with a weeaboo, they will fuck you up. But they just let their imagination get the best of them as they try to bring it to life, but I agree they should really stop and start facing reality
Fuck anime
I don't quite understand the definition of weeabo. Can someone help me
First video I saw on this channel and I already liked and subscribed.
What if they're not just Japanese weapons, and I can use them?

My favourite anime is Paul walkers death...
CORY IN THE HOUSE IS MY SHIT
Kairo Seijuro
Don't leave that ukele in the corner of the room like that. When the headstock leans on the wall, it cause pressure on the neck and will warp it.

4 424 dislike are weeaboos
this shit funny af bruhh
Subscribe me for no reason. Kono yaro
Thank god, I thought I was a weaboo because I liked anime and want to learn the language AND like their culture, but I don't act Japanese or pretend I know the whole language. Yes I do want to visit Japan someday, but I don't know how to use chopsticks etc. and I don't act like I know how too. So apparently I'm not a weaboo. Thank god. Just in case I start acting like one, kill me before I start to breed.
Anime is shit
See I want to go Japan. But... I'm not Japanese and I can't speak any of it.Corey in the house is the best anime

I just noticed, if filthy frank is the anime hunter, he would have to hunt down Cory in the house, Seinfeld, and airplane instruction videos from the 80's.
This is the best video ever. I laughed too hard at this eye opening rant lmao.
I watched Boku no Pico, I am an otaku now right? RIGHT?
3:44 With captions says 'There's a peasant outside my window.'

I love Cory in the House, does that mean that I am a weeaboo?
R.I.P GAME in sweden
I like Anime and hope to visit Japan for the scenery and culture, but holy fuck this video hit the nail on the head.
All of this can be solved by uniting planet earth under one nation.

So watching anime then becoming interested in learning the language means you're a Weeaboo? that's like an international person watching Ghostbusters with subtitles and wanting to learn English because it sounds cool. But we wouldn't judge them, would we...

The FitnessGram‚Ñ¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.

Tell me Dr. Frank, can Weeaboos be in other cultures? I've met very many white trash fags who act like black people, they even say they are, I killed them vigilantly but there are mor out there

OMG I GOT AN ADD FOR ROSETTA STONE
"I have a katana collection" And I have a broadsword one. Checkmate.

This was a little funny, but why the fuck is he talking that way?? Is it to cover up his weaboo accent and voice ??

my fav anime is fresh prince of bel air
I'm an anime fan and own a body pillow (no, I do not masturbate on it). On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being not a weeaboo, and 10 being the worst type of weeaboo, where do I fall?
One thing about anime...

I'm Japanese and hate Japanese culture....
I wanna eat your face, it looks tasty.0_0

If someone is not a German man

Attack On weaboo episode 7, fall of weaboo jones.
lol, half the people commenting on this video have an anime profile picture
so are you a weeaboo if you want to learn Japanese because of anime but you don't call yourself japanese?
Anime is the reason everyone is retarded
6:29 The best way to say "We have to run" Japanese
my favorite anime was a team
Are you really 52?
Anyone else have an anime profile pic like me?
I laughed so hard at the amount of dislikes on this video.
We as a Papa Franku community like to imagine every single person who disliked this video as a Weaboo.
Imagine all of the redneck virgins living in their moms basement with manga on their desk.
Imagine how corrupt their web history is.
Imagine if they have no soul!
Now excuse me, I'm going to like this video.
Where can I download that sweet song?
Not to mention, Weebs think that real Japanese girls sound like Justin Beiber on Helium with this testicals crushed by a fucking hydraulic press.
I'm dead, I am so dead, I literally died from laughter
Their not called weeabos. Their called otakus. Weeabos are racist losers.
"There are 2 people in my closet"
"They're both dead"
Rate my weeaboo level senpai.
You have to make a distinction though, if a person is knowledgeable about Japanese culture (which mean both good and bad stuff)and likes Japan more than his own country, does that make him as bad as what we commonly refer to as a weeaboo? And then there are extreme otaku (like that german guy) who's just really into the waifu and cute shit to the point of disgusting, does that make them weeaboo? People seem to forget that obsession of Japanese culture and not being a weeaboo can go together, not common, but possible.
I get it, it's the Internet, people like call other people using derogatory terms for jokes and insults but I sincerely hope you guys actually know and consider the meaning of words you use, and that misuses are purely ironical.
When he talks Japanese his voice is so smooth but when he talks English he sounds like batman with strept throat
frank has an anime avatar, he is a hypocrite.
"My wife is coming to life" rofl.
7:42 obv fake
I happen to be kinda of a weeaboo and my girlfriend, who happens to be a Japanese exchange student, loves it.
"wowowo where's the subtitles ?"
I NEED A SECOND VIDEO ABOUT THIS XD hahahahahaha!!! I laughed soo much
FUCKEN WEEABOOS
is he really 52
Frank's voice in the beginning makes me really moist.
I don't care it's just when people try to piss me off about anime, like I don't care if they say i don't like anime, it's when they they say you a pussy cuz u watch anime, and im just trying to prove a point and not be a fucking weeaboo
"Hey boss"
I'm a filthy frank weaboo. I am his clone
9:58 looks like pbg
make video about crazy Kpop fangirl/fanboy
Weaboos in a nutshell
Frank where are you hiding Hitler we all know he is not dead. jk love ur vids man.
same as the Playstation faggots
You know what's worse than attack on titan?Sword art online.
you sound like you've been smoking since you came out the womb
the song sounds fucking awesome
well... at least anime avatars are better than mindcraft avatars.
im a disappointment to papa franku, everything in my gallery has something to do with anime or memes. ;_;
My fav anime is the Filthy Frank show.
Anime is SHIT
Anime sucks ass
7:41 he sounds like light Yagami oh boy
my favourite Anime is avatar the last Airbender
nobody remebers stick figures ='(
but don't worry
we will rise again.....
I see where you're coming from Frank, but One Piece is fucking amazing
I fangasm every time he speaks japanese
5:11
One thing about anime. What you gonna do weeaboos?
I doubt the seven seas hold as much salt as this comment section.
Dont look Down on someone unless you intend to help them Up. Hmm... or...¬†How about letting these people have a reason to live? Life sucks, we all can agree,¬†so they created a world that is tolerable for them. Maybe its a mental disease, but a better one than a lot that is going around this planet. Make a video about rapists instead, because you are wasting your breath on innocent People.
im sad to say my school has a anime club and everyone their is a weeaboo
he didn't even throw a kunai from an anime, he throw a kunai from fucking tf2
I like anime because a lot of them are pretty good, funny, or action packed (etc)     But, I FUCKING HATE WEEABOOS, LIKE NO JUST ENJOY IT MAYBE?
After this video ended, I went on my Xbox to play some CoD BO2 online, and I ran into a lobby filled with weeaboos. May god have mercy on my soul.
The holocaust is my favourite anime
Oh yeah, give me the mei meis
6:19 i cant handle htis
„É¶„ÉÄ„É§‰∫∫ÔΩó
9:00  +Melon Pan ?
4:33 I JUST SPAT OUT MY APPLE JUICE
How does your camera man keep a straight face dude you're so fucking funny
Attack on Titan is good.  Lots of innocent people get murdered which is cool.
Weeaboos are trash
oh shit, i have a manga picture as my profile. I'm such a disgrace to this world
Frank is my hero
4:50 made me shit myself laughing
I'm just scrolling down the comments looking for anime profile pics.
"Borderline pedophile" XDDDDD
Frank said "Two Jewish people stuck inside my corset, and they're both dead" when subtitle "are you ready to have some fun?" "I sure am" rolled.
10:06 Is that fucking Jonah Hill?
this guy is a savage
1:06. VOICE CRACK
1:51 well Pygmalion has reached his goal, so why couldnt I?
why is he taking a shit while he is speaking ?????
The fucking Hado chan one

Oh my God

I can't believe I'm part of the same species as these...things
To be honest, I also don't think collecting swords is bad. I'm not saying it's "accurate to Japanese culture" or anything, but what if someone just thinks swords look really cool (like myself, though I don't collect swords) and wants them for display. There's no weeaboo there, just someone getting things he thinks is cool and collecting them.
Y'know, maybe we have anime avatars because we like the anime or thinks it looks cool?

I mean, I get some of them are assholes, but not everyone? I won't freak out if you talk about anime.

...

I'm putting serious commentary on a Filthy Frank video...

...
Filthy frank just isn't the same since he moved
You should make animation with you nice voices you can do.
What if you collect any type of weapons and could only use some... I cant hold some of the huge blades because i have half my left hand.
Cory in the house is best anime
8:59 is that Melon Pan? Xd that guy is fucking hilarious
Something happens here today, and no I'm not talking about the fat people with their body pillows who smell like cheese like that musty stanky moldy cottage cheese yeah those people. I think frank may have just started WEEB WAR 3

FOUR word to contradict that sentence from me wanting to buy a REAL FUCKING SHARP ASS SWORD: 

COUNTER SKINS - GLOBAL OFFENSIVE

I hate this people ....ooh shit
is this where the "cory in the house anime" meme came from?
This is probably gonna be the closet Papa Franku is to making a serious video. Lowkey lessons about cultural appropriate and comedy is something that everybody needs.
He's not really 52 is he
You remins me of chandler from friends..
I hate america for all the political corruption....
I watch a lot of anime and people call me a weaboo. I don't do any of the shit he mentioned in the vid. I never use Japanese words nor do I think of myself as Japanese.
My favorite anime is Sex In The City
I feel you frank. I wanted to be Thomas the Tank Engine too.
HEAAARRTCATCH PRRREEECUUUURE

My favorite animes are the Holocaust documentaries.
is he for real or is this a joke
HENTAIIIII :D:D:D;)-
hahahhahahaha so funny :D
This is a real and deadly disease that is usually terminal. Just trying to spread awareness.
"it's a really good show"
I know people that are both weeaboos and otakus and that quote is said for every show they talk about, it can be horror, drama, action/adventure. "Oh yea that is a really good one". There all the same to me.
AMINE IS FUCKING TRASH
I watch A LOT of anime, I have an addiction I constantly watch them (apart from school and lol),I talk about them a lot as well with my friends, I do not pretend to know Japanese, I don't buy anime merch and I still follow my social culture. (Compared to my friends who don't watch anime, I follow my culture more than them). I am extremely proud of my heritage and no matter how much I like anime I would never give it up, I find that idea stupid. So could I be classed as a Weeaboo?
Attack on titan is my favorite anime, it is not a bad show.
You know what language weeaboos speak? ...MANGANESE! laugh track
Is there a way to give this man money? I feel like it is my duty.
YO COREY IN THE HOUSE IS AN AMAZING ANIME
8:50 he's actually a pretty cool guy. He told me to never let a girl on her period near your bed. Justin, you are meme.
Does anyone know the Arabic music in Frank's videos?
It'd be a lot better if everyone just accepted everyone like who the fuck cares who someone is? HOW CAN PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTAND THIS? Video was funny as fuck though
Borderline pedophilia is the best kind of pedophilia.

Rasengan up their asses was fucking hilarious.
to all the people that are stupid engoughghgh to not understand what weeaboo means after Filthyfrank explaining it...
Weeaboo:
Someone who is obsessed with Japan/Japanese Culture/Anime, etc. and attempts to act as if they were Japanese, even though they're far from it. They use Japanese words but usually end up pronouncing them wrong and sounding like total assholes. You can find alot of these faggots clogging up the forums of Gaia Online, hanging out in the international aisle of the supermarket, or crowding the manga section of your local bookstore.

a weeaboo is not someone who is not japanese that likes anime...
if u still dont understand... you are just really dumb and  dont have the brain capacity to understand...

"Where are the subtitles "
My favorite anime is Hitler burning the Jews
Just my opinion, but he would make a perfect Joker
I used to have a friend who used to go to my school and she's a weeb. She insulted random people in horribly inaccurate Japanese and her screen name was "Weeaboo of the USA :3333"
She's also fat and never goes outside.
I cringe everytime I think of her. shudder
I speak five languages and last week I started learning japanese because I plan to visit Japan together with my brother and somehow I have to know how to ask for directions or order food. The only thing they thought us in the first lesson is how to Greet and how to say "I".

When I told my friend "Hey look what we did today!" she gave me a confused look and started teaching me some shit she saw in an anime (I mean, I watch anime too .. only two but I do). I cried when she tried to convince me I have to say "Ore" or "Boku" even though I said "I'm a fucking girl! I can't say that!" She said I know shit and she knows better because her "daddy" says "Ore" all the time. 

I am still crying. I think I have to end this friendship as soon as possible (._. )
my favourite anime is any movie with Natalie Portman in it .
Frank, you promoting your mixtape to us?

How is the guy at 9:01 a weaboo? There's nothing Japan related in that room, he has a European Claymore sword...
I love you frank but please stop watch anime its destroying mankind!
1:06 to 1:29 that's me. I just like anime...period. 
I have about 40 animes under my belt. I have some interest in japanese language and culture, but I don't want to BE Japanese. 
I honestly find it hard to find people in the world who are just simply interested in anime, and not complete and totally consumed by it. 
Sure I might spend a weekend every now and then and marathon a show, but I don't have the urge to change how I look and act because of some shows I like.
anime is entertaing but the stupid part are those weaboos who try to act japanese and have anime shit all over there house
4 341 weaboos didn't like this video. Btw, my brother and my friend are slowly becoming weaboos, what should I do to make it stop now before it's too late. My friend already booked a trip to Japan!
Papa Franku, if you watch family guy but you re Japanese then you are something worse than weeaboos, reverse weeaboos.
WAAAAAA >.> He really is so damn right >.<' Weeaboos on youtube are so annoying, bunch of kusoface bakas ww
all the weeaboos are asking my Japanese american teacher to teach them Japanese so she said she will try to get her dad here to teach them because she knows only a bit of the language

Forever alone...
Difference between Weeaboos and Anime Fans
Weeaboo: Thinks Japan is superior and praises Japan even though they are not Japanese. Tries to act and speak Japanese but instead disgraces Japan itself. A pure embodiment of evil and cancer
Anime Fan: Someone who might not be Japanese but isn't pure cancer like a weeaboo. Actually has a life and doesn't life at their computer desk and doesn't buy nasty hentai body pillows. Also doesn't act Japanese. 

Hopefully this helps!
(P.S. Weeaboos should go get a life, instead of jacking off to hentai everyday)
"Wha-Wha-Where are the subtitles?" <LOL I WAS DYING!!!
Why don't you Americans understand us...
Having sex with a painted pillow is perfectly legal and none of your business!
Plus I only have sex with made in Japan pillows, none of that filthy American crap.
You don't have control over something your country didn't even make!
I take offense to you generalizing us as jobless! My job at the local McDonald's is perfectly fine!
Who said we can't understand japanese without subtitles? Check this out: give me any Japanese sentence, and I can find an anime in which it is used, and I can translate the sentence perfectly!
Skill in anime is no joke! I know more about Japanese culture than any of you about American culture!
After all, Japan isn't a cobbled together country unlike America.
Watching anime 24/7 is perfectly normal. Here's my favourite quote:
"Unlimited bait works".
fresh prince is my favorite anime
wouldn't it be amazing if they took every Filthy Frank video and put them together in a movie? that would be the apocalypse. everyone would either die of laughter or offensiveness

I mean, I watch anime on the down-low; I'd be lying if I said I didn't jack it to Hentai sometimes. But I know the limit. I don't get caught up in it or that crap. I just pick up my guitar and play to get my mind off it if I want to.
Weeaboos make me ashamed to watch anime.

dont you dare talk shit about anime here let me tell you in japanese since i learn it without anime Anime wa besuto no motherfuckers IS
I can't stand reading what they say and i don't see why anyone does :/
when I was young lad growing up in an orphanage just south of Berlin, life was tough. I was beaten by my masters constantly and the only escape from that he'll I felt in each day was when I would climb to the roof and watch the stars in the sky and dream that one day, I would be as free as the stars I spent every night gazing at. One day, my only friend Gorojutsi died, and after his death I decided to pack my things and run away for the orphanage had nothing left for me . The journey for a home was long,lonely and my heart grew more empty with each stranger who shut their door in my face. But there was one man, whom when I knocked, did not shut the door on me or make fun of me for hunched back and webbed fingers, for he did not even say a word but invited me in with his silent stare. I would spend many days and nights with this man learning the ways of ramen and studying the old scripture of cringe yet he never spoke a word. From my conversing with the other villagers, I would learn that he was called by the name of Papa Franku the village ramen chef, and that he swore to never speak a word until he lost his virginity and bore a son. After many years I began to grow fond of papa Franku and one bright,crisp morning upon the sultry hills of nagasaki I told him that he would no longer need to search for a woman for I would be his son (besides he was far to grotesque to attract a female for sexual harvest anyways, ducking creep). He shed a lone tear after I spoke and gave me a kiss upon my forehead before saying his first word in 75 chi (600000 human years) and that word was "segoy". However the next morning when I awoke, he was gone. I was not mad, nor distraught upon discovering his absence because I knew he was free and in turn so was I. I still yearn to eat ramen with my adoptive father and laugh at murphy, his autistic cow who always tried to suck from its own utters like we used to and maybe one day we will, when the the time is right. But I am content with knowing that I am still in his filthy, fucking cancerous heart wherever he is. S.....segoy papa franku....segoy
I meant 1:17-1:20
What did you look up for the picture at 1:17-1:19? Also, brilliant accuracy on Weeaboo Jones. Not even kidding. Genius

please stop with the "kill yourself" jokes
I'm surprised no one commented about the opening. Good job, subtitling team. You totally hit the mark on that last sentence.
I don't think being a weeaboo depends on how smart you are or anything because no matter how smart you are, that shit will fucking brainwash you after a while. I'm serious, man.

Hi everybody. I am an anthropology student at Seton Hall University, and I am doing a survey of the YouTube community, to
learn about the YouTube community and what it tells us about our culture. We don't know much about it honestly, so any information you can give us is going to be a great help. Thanks!

¬†https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ec6Hez5u_lywoMQyVAfRkuHVuoL67k2feBWCogTlLGI/viewform
my fav anime is The Cosby Show
My first issue here is to inform your uneducated fat American ass that anime is so much better than anything you could find on your widescreen televisions. There is no way that Seinfield or whatever other shit you watch could possibly compare to the best anime of all time, Naruto. It's so good that even some of you Amerifags decided to adopt it for American television, but let's be honest, dub sucks compared to sub.

My second issue is your usage of the terms "weeaboo" and the phrase "anime sucks". I have already explained why anime does not suck and is in fact superior to your television programming. However, your use of "weeaboo" is where you messed up BIG TIME. I am not a weeaboo, I identify as an otaku, these are two seperate things. An otaku is refined in the art of good anime and discussion on anime forums, and weeaboos are trash that are looked down upon by the Japanese people. (as a side note my dear friend, weeaboos are still better than Amerifags. That's right. How's it feel to be on the bottom of the hierarchy for once?)

I hope you realize that I have learned Japanese from my high school and my closest friends live in Japan and watch anime in their free time. I will be momentarily contacting them and sending them your IP address so you can get DDoS'd HARD. You will regret the day you decided to insult us refined otakus. I hereby declare war on you, you anti-anime baka. May the best samurai win.

P.S. It is not too late to repent. While you are without internet for the next two weeks, I wil be sending you a DVD of Naruto episodes. If you show us that you enjoy anime and will pursue the art of it, we will return your internet ASAP. However, make sure you enable Japanese voices in the settings menu. Or else we will hunt you down doubly as hard.
THIS MADE ME CRINGE XD
This is probably the best Filthy vid.  If you disagree, kindly go FUC- point me in the direction of your favorite!

RIP  PBG
It's sad that most people never got the joke where he speaks in Japanese:

"Are you ready to have some fun? I sure am"

What he really says "There are two rich guys in my closet. I'm killing both of them ."
when he said "someone probably stuck a raesangan up your ass" bruh I died!
Japanese is such a sweet language. I speak Arabic and English and Arabic pretty sweet but I'd like to speak Japanese
Weaboos are like niggers in the US around the end of slavery to about 1970...please request an explanation if you don't understand this shitty metaphor.

but I'm not a weeaboo because I've only got a normal sword and armour because I've been trained with them as a kid
plus it don't even watch anime I mean yea Pokemon and the avatar ( my gosh the movie sucks ) but that's it 
pls decide if I'm a weeaboo and if I need to stop
Filthy Frank is my new role model.
when I watch anime I dubb it to English so I have no idea how to speak Japanese. but I mean this in a way that I'm not a weeaboo. I actually live in ireland

Not that real Japanese people would actually give a shit about what some fat American neckbeard with half a gallon of congealed semen on his body pillow does with his life. And if they do, I want to hear what they have to say.

Does having lived in Japan for 3 years make me a terrible weaboo? If so. Shit
Honestly, I'm into anime and stuff, and I find this absolutely hilarious. Usually, my friends and I make fun of ourselves and each other, purposely acting like over-obsessed weeaboos. xD
You earned my respect boss
My favorite anime characer is Bob Ross
My favorite anime is spongebob
okay this guy does NOT GET it. I AM Japanese. just cuz I'm American does not mean I cannot make myself Japanese. it's what we have name change for, dumbass!

Guys, this video has been watched for 89 years... that's an entire lifetime of cancer.
i cant stop laughing XD
ive always wanted to learn japanese, not because im a flithy weeb but because i think the language is beautiful. is learning it on rosetta stone bad? anyone have any suggestions on where to learn it? papa bless.
There are three levels of weeaboo-ness.
1. They watch anime, and can maybe speak Japanese. They're pretty much normal people.
2. They watch Anime, make fanart, can speak horrible japanese, and should probably get some help.
3. RED ALERT, RED ALERT. THE CRINGE HAS REACHED DEADLY LEVELS. They collect japanese weapons, dress up like anime characters, have a body pillow collection, watch hentai, have extremely ugly shirts and merchandise, and so on. Take them out back and shoot them. Better yet, just snap their neck.
i have foundthe sorceofcancer this
speaking of complete idiots..........
I used to be an weeaboo like you, then I took an arrow in the knee
No entiendo una mierda c: pero hasta yo entiendo que es calidad, y este canal es la mejor mierda de youtube xD
this vid is a perfect example of everything wrong with the Internet and the idea of anonymous identities. So who cares if I have a hobby in anime and choose to spend my time with it? I sure don't need an (yes I know he's part Japanese) American(ized) middle aged dude to tell me what to do. This is becoming ridiculous. The amount of hate me and some of my online friends have been getting as a direct result of this vid can't just be justified by saying "it's just satire bro" People seem to think that just because your on the Internet what you say doesn't mean anything and that people couldn't possibly be on the Internet for any other reason than arguing with a bunch of pre-pubescent boys.





ITS TIME TO STOP
I know this video is comedic, but you gotta admit that the writing and script is on fucking point...
Anime is for fags.
Same
Does just cosplay for like a comicon make people a weeaboo?
I remember when franku-senpai had only 900 000 subs sniff

now he is at 2000 000 subs. My Senpai grows so fast ;_;
and its growing alright ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
congrats on 2 million father
My friends like to call themselves "weaboos" just to be funny. They can if they want, but I feel uncomfortable with it because...well, because of what this video and many others explain.
:(
weeaboo jones part was the best
Now every time I go to shave, I have to say.... a neck beard.........THE DISEASE IS SPREADING.
Make a video on Koreaboos pls papa
Kill you're self OHHHHH YEAHHHH
My favorite anime is The Suite Life of Zack and Cody
Shrek is my favourite anime.
2 million subs omgggg
5:49 follow your dreams son
Yo was that the bitch from bakugan? Yooooo that show was lit I loved that show as a kid
He looks like markiplier
I hate weeaboos. I don't conisder myself a weeaboo, I'm actually Japanese for real, well almost. I will be when I live in Japan though. Right now I'm studying japanese, japanese history and I'm following Bushido, the way of the warrior. This is why I hate weeaboos that know 5 words in japanese and use them all the time, kawaai baka DESU NE MOTHERFUCKER. I'm actually trying to become Japanese for real unlike all these faker wees. ** YOU WEEABOOS
I subbed your channel after watching this vid, man. right on
this shit is hilarious
I used to live in Realm 900
but while we were praying to Chin Chin

the weeaboos came and attacked us
so we finished up and left
Am I weeabo for:
1: watching subbed anime because it's ahead of the dub or there isn't a dub for that anime yet? I watched One Piece and Pokemon dubbed but went to subbed when I caught the dub up, and One Punch Man I watch subbed because there isn't a dub yet

2. I have some Pokemon shirts, figures and posters plus a pair of One Piece shoes along with a shirt? the Pokemon stuff is more related to the games

3. Sometimes I listen to openings of these shows, but obviously I don't understand a word that's being said
Can't stop laughing on the "Hey Boss" part
I lost it at 2:49
PBG is a WEEABOO  Confirmed 9:55
You sound like Batman on drugs. Well to be honest here is a story, I'm part Cambodian and Japanese I mostly look cam. So I met this girl she said she was Japanese also her Instagram showed a lot of anime and vine animes. I always spoke Japanese to her and She kept calling me a weeaboo. I said you don't speak Japanese do you? Then she walked away.
YOUR VOICE IS CREEPPPYYYYY but your video is so true
I INSTANTLY THOUGHT OF EREN FROM AOT AT 4:11
Franku says if we watch anime and hentai then we aren't weebs. I also have a job and there isn't any good japanese food in my city so I don't eat that shit.
I'm ameebo, i luv america gun gun gun gun pew pew pew pew pew.
I miss these videos tbh...he has changed, and he's still fantastic, but this is the stuff on legends
xD omfg I lost it when he was talking about his neighbors waking up
4:30 this part got me dead XD
who's almost a weeaboo
Franku, your waifu is shit.
You are gonna love Brittany Venti then.
I really wanted a piece of Percy's ass
9:58 Is that who I think it is?
At the very beginning of the video he purposely subtitles it incorrectly.  In Japanese at the part where the subtitles say "Are you ready to have some fun? I sure am!" he is actually saying that he has two dead people hidden in his closet...
types angry on keyboard.Oh wait I love cory in the house.XD
my favorite anime is Isis executions
Make fun of those fucking bronies
this some class-a hentai.

"I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass, you feel me" lol

I fully support Japanese xenophobia. I would rather hear 'whitu piggu go home' everyday than hear the sound of minarets calling terrorists to prayer.
Also I think shoujo romance animes are haram
Shoutout to everyone who watched frank before he was popular.

I respect Japan and anime, but their candies are my weakness D:
Yo I heard you were talking shit about my waifu, Major Alex Louis Armstrong of the Armstrong family.  I'll fuck your shit up, dude.  Watch yourself, FilthyFrank-dono-san.

What anime attack would Danny Sexbang if he was a weeaboo? Jew jitsu
My favorite anime is Mr. rogers Neighborhood.
I was a weeaboo, but I realized what I was becoming so I stabbed myself with my katana
ajdflahew8 8hhe ta;llijgke da shitz about animus omgefz tiksd q2 dyee
Is this where the Cory in the house meme started
weeaboos should die in anime hell in my opinion.
LMS (lost my shit) AT "w..w..where are t he subtitles?"
Demolition D+ and FilthyFrank need to fornicate, have a child and force them into YouTube.
fucking furfags make fun of those shits
OH GAWD NOT A SLIDESHOW OF FAGGGSSSS
In the beginning even though the subtitles said "Are you ready to have some fun? I sure am," what he said in Japanese was basically "I have two foreigners in my closet. And they're both dead." O_O
fuck you, my hubert cumberdale body pillow is sick as fuck
At 4:50 I just.. I just... Wow idk if it's funny or just funny
The Fine Bros should make a Weeaboos react to Weeaboos
okay if my favorite anime is Cory In The House am I a weeabo?

THIS GUY IS THE WEIRDEST FCUKING FUNNIEST GUY OUT THERE HE SPEAKS FCUKING JAMPANESE ANS WTF ITS HILARIPUR
Linkstr√§ger
why am i attracted to him
As much as I wish this wasn't true but a huge portion of bronies are not really that far behind. 

Keeping a profile pick, seeing the shows every now and then etc is okay but then there is this borderline a lot of them will cross that will be just as weird as weeaboos. I nearly got into a fight with one for trying to put this pony s** doll on me.
A N D FUCK ATTACK ON TITN
the only anime is DBZ ITS OVER 9000
I hate those filfy degenerates
my friend: "I'm 1/4 Japanese so blah blah blah and F you, you white devil for nuking Japan and 1/2 German so heil Hitler 1488-" me STFU
I knew a faggot who had a katana collection, an obsession for hentai and thought he knew karate from anime.
Reality checked him when I beat his ass in karate and drove off in my muscle car.
I don't think i was a weeabo back then but i was always fascinated by japanese culture. I checked out a book in local library trying to learn the language but that's waayyy too hard xD
Lesson Frank would be an amazing Japanese voice actor.
Frank is my spirit animal.
I want to blow up my local airport.
frank looks like benny's long lost brother from the fine bros
2:25 that kinda looks like arin from the game grumps....
I do collect bladed weaponry but it's not specifically Japanese and don't get much sleep but that's because I'm an insomniac I don't exhibit any other symptoms of weeabus
RIP his voice
Gibe Da Weeaboos B0ss
my favorite anime is the 9/11 tapes

Oh my God, there is a black weeaboo... God has abandoned us...
The Meaning of Juice, By the one and Only, Rock and Rulle Juice. It is made of water and a known fruit. It is something that we the people take for granted. But, it is more than a thirst quencher. It is an aesthetic fluid, which rejuvenates the already defunct and moribund cells in the human body. This fluid creates a sort of happiness which cannot be found on other drinks. It absolutely discomfits the depression caused by lack of happiness, in which people succomb to during their meaningless lives. Our lives, as stated by the scientific community which dictates what to think and what not to think, are meaningless and we, amongst all beings, living and dead, are essentially nothing. We living creatures were borne out of chance, lived our lives with no purpose whatsoever, and, finally, die a meaningless deathe. This, my friends, is life. Live it like you are supposed to live it, with no purpose or direction. That is how to enjoy life. It doesn't matter whether you are a "christian", "jew", buddhist, or some other label you put on, your lives are essentially meanningless if you know that you are going to die anyway. But, I will say this: try to enjoy your life. Make it awesome and beneficent, without regrets, because, I assure you, You will regret not enjoying your last moments of living. FIN.
Where can I learn proper Japanese? And to read Japanese too? (and no, I don't watch anime to learn Japanese, I just thought maybe Google Translate won't be so good at teaching me.)
It's been over a year and a half, and you guys still haven't come up with a new joke.
frank?

frank mate?

why do you talk in that growley way  like that?
I have the same constant problem...I am half-Japanese but people call me a weeaboo because they think that all Japanese names comes from an anime AND THEREFORE ALL JAPANESE PEOPLE ARE WEEABOOS! I hate people who stereotype

"Hey boss"
I have an anime club at my school. I've been in it since 9th grade. The first two years were good. I recently quit because it suddenly became jam packed with weebs. It was tolerable at first, but after a few weeks they just became more and more cringeworthy

Is this where the sick people of the Internet congregate to praise Frank
'nobody practices jutsu's in the corner' hahhahaha

Herrow mo nam es toyu an moy lok tree deb on vy spere tgme
Wait... I want to study in Japan, because I want to have a feeling of DIFFRENT life styles in the world... Does that make me a weeaboo? I don't watch anime, and I want to learn the Japanese language properly, does that still make me a weeaboo?My favourite Japanese letter that I found on many agario vids and later found on a Japanese keyboard: „ÉÑ
FUCKING DIE
If Franku is 52, IM 52

My favorite anime is the newest Chicken Little.
Ey B0ss
"My Name is... Cowboy Tanaka"
lets see how many weaboos react to this

Anime is for nerds and it fucking sucks.

but srsly tho anime can be fucking gross at points
this video saved my life from them
Can you explain weeaboo cosplayers
i watch anime but i dont try to be japanese even thoi can speak a little bit of japanese
I haven't cringed this hard in a long time.
we used to call them table kids back in college
i was a weeaboo, it was a dark time.
I've seen a weeaboo shoot up a school I was gonna shoot.so I shot his anime convention
Anime
I stick my dick into my Cory in the house body pillow everyday ;)
Ahem...

Keep in mind: A non-Japanese person can like the culture, watch anime, speak the language and RESPECT the culture, while still keeping in touch with their own. Which keeps them from being a weeaboo, Japanophile, etc.

Just wanted to point that out- It was in the video. Stop calling everyone you see that likes anime a weeaboo. People can watch it without being one.

P.S. There's literally nothing wrong with having an anime profile picture. As long as it doesn't disrespect the culture then it's indeed fine. I mean, most of you have pictures of cartoon characters as your profile pics, so why can't we?

I'm ready for all the hate comments...
Pretty good, one Slight inaccuracy tho. In 9:09 the guy is holding a long sword of European origin, not Asian. So that wouldn't necessarily make him a weaboo.
Malcolm in the Middles the best anime ever
My favorite animes r full house black ops 1 videos and filfthyfrankshow
7/11 was a part time job
Who built his weeaboo protection chamber, I want one.
Hey jerk stop fun people who watch Japanese anime, and calling them weeaboos. Saying a reality shows are anime. If people watch Japanese anime and dress up as any anime characters or read manga also respecting Japanese culture or speak Japanese. So call me weeaboo all you want people. I'll not stop learning about Japanese culture, speaking Japanese, read manga, watching anime, and dress as one of my favorite anime characters(didn't happened yet because I don't have enough money) sure call me a weeaboo I don't care.
Who's watching this in Japan
0:15 actual translation
I have two children in my closet... they are both dead

FRANK MY FAVOURITE  ANIME IS TOY STORY
WATCH HENTAI FOR FREE you have to be at school
I like animes(not all, some, like the first 4 ep of SAO) and i like to try and learn a bit of japanese out of them, but if an actual japanese guy would come to me i would just say "Sorry m8 i dont speak japanese" like it's a thing to try and say 3 words and another to actually make him cry when u try to speak it(Btw i have no posters or bodypillows with anime, that is a bit too far)
Seinfeld is best anime.
1:05 VOICE CRACK.
Whoa his Japanese pronunciation is really good!
I think that we can all agree................... he is the best rape face of 2015-2016 xD
Do a rant about 90's kids bragging

Did anyone else realise that Christina Aguilera was playing? Or was that just me...
Am I the only person who accepts being a weeaboo and find this absolutely hilarious. Being a weeaboo shouldn't be offensive. If you are an otaku you are basically a weeaboo no matter how you cut it it literally means the same thing. 

I have a waifu her name is Blanc(or White heart)(hyperdimension neptunia).
I love anime
I do not have a body pillow
doesn't have a manga collection or any posters.

I'm not a weeb, but I see nothing wrong with buying anime merchandise (katanas are a red flag though unless you do know how to use one).
I hate people who collect Katana's! Everybody know the Zwiehandler is the superior blade.

Those subtitles at the beginning don't really match up with what you're really saying, do they? :D
Frank I'm worried I cosplayed as ash for comic con am I a weeaboo

Why put Chis Chan as one of the pics in that montage. Yeah he's an anime freak but he's so patriotic over his American hometown it's cringeworthy.
Weeaboo... What a funny word. Fuck them. I've always found that annoying.
u actually have a nice voice when u speak Japanese but when u speak English it sounds like a lawnmower speaking

How do you watch Filthy Frank for 3 months and realize you haven't even subscribed to him yet?
why do people hate me....
His voice makes my throat hurt why x.x
Frank, I need help.

My school has a club dedicated to Weeaboos.
aka a nerd
well papa,
I'm here.
My favorite anime is shawn the sheep
It's time to stop.
An anime ad popped up while I was watching this
My favorite part of this video is how he had to make sure no one got triggered in the beginning.
i dont know who are worse, weeaboos or people that are gender fluid
8:51
That's it, I want to die.
4:00 havent laughed so hard in ages
Saying your a weaboo means disrespecting the culture. So all those who are proud of being weaboos, are you proud of disrespecting the culture?
some of these pics are really wierd I get people like anima but you should just embrace who you are
This spoke to me on a whole other level.
Boss boss please! lololololüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
and this is the person who started the harlem shake thing? o-o
I don't think weeaboos even respond to reality check anymore, to be honest.
this is why there should be a "Weeaboo Protection Department"
Don't let your dreams be memes.
Are this Frank guy is Japanese or not because he's really good mimicking one.
All the emos cried at 6:19
My favorite anime is the Amanda Todd video
My favorite anime is Magic Mike
I wanted to get a captain levi body pillow just as a joke then i realized that was a bad idea and people probably wouldnt think its jsut a joke

This is kinda like white people and rap music.. When they start believing they're black because they listen to so much rap
I've only ever watched Naruto.. The English dubbed version.. So you know fuck Weaboos
What's that anime at 1:17? It looks pretty cute tbh
9:49 bruhhh this nigga right here is a fucking weeb to the max on facebook talking about why you gotta be so Tsundere and shit lol

This vid is so funny
..I like .. Korean Drama cuz these weeaboos ruined the Anime for me.
how do you know
Lol i've watched hentai and it was with tentacles... it was scarry...
I use Japanese weapons. Not for collection. :3
the most annoying thing on the internet is furries bronies and weeabos because 90% of them can't handle opinions and criticism and their porn is so fuckong nasty bronies and furries porn is bestiality and hentai is just pedophile shit. like all three of them should just die because their fandom is just one big sin.
So....what ever happened to those two people?
We shall start a rebellion against weeaboos and bronys

This is gold.
What the fuck is ''rezettestone'' or something?
Best anime is correy in the house

fucking internet fandoms like furries, bronies, and weeaboos are not ok.
Stop talking shit about animu I'm gonna slice your dick with my kunai collection.
OMG?!?!?! xD
My ex-friends were weeaboos (making out pairings in every fucking anime or fan-made characters, learning Japanese in their high school) - should I feel sorry for being kicked out of their Facebook friend list without any warning after 3 years of friendship and sharing real mails and gifts?

weeaboos bronies and furries are the scum of the earth
If a weeaboo reads this then you should really read the attack on titan no regrets manga ISABEL AND FARLANS DEATHS ARE.... i wont wreck it 4 you just you have to read it part 1 and 2‚ù§üíõüëîüíé
I think I'd probably watch a filthyfrank anime
Neta, cuando veo a este tipo de gente me da un chingo de lastima y le agradezco a Dios por no darme un cerebro y mentalidad tan pendeja y perdedora.

Nothing else is as sad as a fucking Weerboo.

I love reading anime and watching mangos.
Haha.  Chinese cartoons.  Fucking speaking taiwanese or some shit.
I am a Otaku, not a Weeaboo
He really reminds me of pewds...
Wait he's Russian? Or can just speak Russian?
Thomas the tank engine was definitely the best anime as a kid, but Jay Jay the jet plane was a close second. It just needed some character development. They also left out a lot of stuff from the manga.
america deserved 9/11!!
internet cancer:
1:weeaboo

Frank is freaking great like legit screw the haters he gets anytime I'm on the channel I'm laughing my a** off
weebs don't even know that Katana's are used as a secondary melee weapons and the swords are primary melee weapons. Katana's are light weight, thin and fragile. One stupid move and it may break. its not good for sword fights. only for fending off a threat that has no weapons or have small and weak weapons like Shurikens (depends on what kind of shuriken that is)
Top 3 anime

CORY IN THE HOUSE
My favorite anime is Friends.
I looked up xenophobic:

Xenophibic: Having or showing a dislike or prejudice against people from other countries.

Weeaboos are LITERALLY praising the people who think they're complete idiots. And it's mostly America. I know somebody who has foam katanas in his room and has a SAO desktop picture. Jesus christ...
My favourite anime is Vietnamese flashbacks
Oh dear did you actually play the beginning notes of Welcome to the black parade on your recorder because im
„Éä„Ç§„Çπ„Éü„Éº„É†
WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH? o_o
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is the funniest shit ever
Weeaboo Jones Im crying =,D
I love Filthy Frank. He's pretty spot on with a lot of the topics he brings up.
Can i masturbate to teenage anime girls if i'm a teenage boy ;D
EXCUSE   MEH HOW DARE U INSULT THE WEEABOOS EXCUSE ME O MMGGGGG!!!!!!1111!!!111!111!
dude weebs lmao
My favorite anime is the wall in front of me.
cory in the house is my favorite
You are bananas, which is precisely what I like about you
I wonder if you can be a weaboo and be japanese
Also you can use swords for zombie apocolypse
All weaboos die when they go to Japan from shock cause japan
My profile picture is of Cory Baxter holding some ass, and my Steam Profile is full of anime games such as HuniePop, Sakura Angels, Sakura Spirit, Sakura Fantasy Chapter 1, Sakura Swim Club, Sakura Beach, Sakura Beach 2, Sakura Clicker, and Sakura Santa, but I don't obsess over it. Does that make me a weeaboo.Btw, I sexually identify as an attack helicopter.
This guy is awesome
Why no no de videos?
You sir, are a genius I hate weeaboos I hate anime, it is stupid, you and I should team up to kill anime!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
im not a weeabo i like anime the food and everything about Japan BUT  i am a Canadian always will be no matter what.
i watch anime and sometimes try to learn anime so does that make me an weeaboo?
I am very offended by the katana collection thing. My collection has been growing before I knew what an anime was.
Weeaboo Jones is too accurate
I hope this guy lives in a middle of the forest. I wouldn't be surprise if he would live in that suicide forest in Japan.
Spongebob is pretty much the best anime
Favorite anime 
ALLAH HU AKBAR
These comments are really reflecting society as a whole. All that seems to happen is that somebody likes something that another person doesn't (that could be anything not just anime) and the other person gets harassed by the person who doesn't like that certain thing. It shows just what monsters human beings really are. Most of the people who are being crude in the comments are too young or too stupid to realize that you can't say that kind of shit to somebody on the internet. You could say it too the wrong person. I mean the WRONG person. I'm not one of those PC or anti bullying asses who says this kind of shit on every video but it's getting out of hand. Not everyone has the self esteem of a douchebag on the internet. For some people anime or whatever could be the only thing that makes them happy in their life. Saying that it's absolutely wrong to like it and they should drink bleach or kill themself for liking it could leave them nothing to live for. 


This video was good. But you guys are just taking it way out of hand. If you tell me to kill myself or I have autism or something like that you just proved my point.
I like to jack off to fnaf porn
The best anime is hitler
Theres also a Reason We Bombed Hiroshima
R......rosetta stone
I should be doing my homework.
WHAT THE FUCK HE DOES THE ANIME VOICE SO GOOD WHAT THE FUCKKKK
I can't read
This is my first video I've seen of this guy... is his voice really like that?
Why does everyone say furries are yiffers? Furries like to be half animals, while yiffers want to fuck furries. Furries aren't as bad as weeaboos, while yiffers are. That said, furries are still pretty weird.
Frank was later murder by weaboos
Are you actually Japanese?
Attack on Titan is for psychos
im sitting here watching this in a hokage out fit
Are you dating Bernie Sanders?
I have an anime icon I have never acted like that‚Ä¶
What is that music? (not the weeaboo one). It's so good.
The ending made me cry harder than the ending of Lost
9:58 Is that PBG?
All I thought of was forever alone for all of those pictures
I have a Hillary Clinton body pillow

‚ÄìPapa Franku
My favorite anime is Cory Shrexter in the Swamp
Wow i find this very offensive, I'm i full fledged weeabo. I've watched a hundred consecutive hours  of anime and listened the first 7 minutes of the pimsleur method (NOT ROSETTA STONE) let me give you an example to you tonto (dumb in japanese) people. Denada ni  hen wang shao shengri quila gracias el saudi arabia (this sentence is too complicated for you non-japanese people)
Weebs aint the problem. The problem is people misunderstanding the word and thus calling casual anime watchers weebs.
this comment section¬†cured my Cancer by giving my Cancer Cancer.
nice video Frank! keep going papafranku, or i will fuck u. :*
ey b0ss
My favorite anime is the FilthyFrankShow
People can take Anime too far.  üòí
My favorite anime 1 keeping up with the kardashians 2 celebrity apprentice 3 the walking dead
franku is very young for a 52 year old
The hooters girls are from realm 6.7; the one true hell...
What if I learn swordsmanship and buy an anime blade? Am I considered a weeaboo?
I died when Salamander Man started playing the flute with his nose. GETS ME EVERYTIME, SALAMANDER MAN
Congrats Frank, your fans are now going around constantly calling people who like anime weeaboos.
Anime sucks
init fam, fucking anime profile pics are gay m8, fukin' chingchong cartoons bruv, 
the only anime i will eva watch will b cory in the house.
I don't get it why people get so mad when somebody jokes about anime like for example i'm 12 and I just get that it's just a joke  and yeah I might look as a weeb (cuz of my profile pic) but I'm not I just don't get like people that try to say every possible shit in japanese and even say that they are best at japanese language and all this other shit so yeah hope you'll understand me
are you really 52? and still can do bboy handstands (on pinkguy video)? mad props!
I respect to his japanese and my favorite anime is love live :)
welcome to the internet. Where everybody is fucked up
Am I a weaboo?
Hitler is my waifu
i remember when i went through the weaboo stage, when i really wanted to move to japan, i made sure to take a good dose of bleach after that
Where the fuck is Frank getting all these outfits?
„Åä„ÅÑ„Å™„Å´„Åì„Çå„ÅìÔºüÔΩóÔΩóÔΩóÔΩóÔΩóÔΩóÔΩóÔΩó
I was a huge ass weeb growing up. I have since toned it down a lot. I just watch the shows and read the books and that's
I like junjou romantica
Is frank part Japanese or something?

Weeaboos*
Why do weeabos exist?
Lol that "We have to run" Translation you cant lie to me
ÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçêÂçê
Weaboos finally dissed  üëè
What are you called if you watch a lot of anime go to conventions but don't obsess over it and instead just make it a hobby to do in your spare time?
Fuck anime
My sister is a "Weeaboo" Her username is "Kyo" and she has a "Hentai" profile pic.
KILL YOURSELF! OOOOOOOHHHHH YYEEEEEEEAAAAAH OOOOOOOOHHHHHH YYYYYEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHH!
Turn on the captions when you watch this.
4,046 Weebs disliked this video.
did frank just say he was 52
Weeaboo song is way better than Justin bieber any day, any universe!
Frank sounded so fucking sexy when he was talking in Japanese, especially the part when he whispered in my ear and made me wet all over.
Ayyy but what does Papa Franku feel about Anglophiles and those annoying ass obsessive Harry Potter fans?
I want a hitler body pillow
Fuck this shit anime is the best
In realm 666 you will find the weeaboo source, it lays eggs and it's dangerous
The vile and filthy Weaboo is "a quisling".





But seriously, fuck those a-rhythmic Dubs!
favorite anime of all time rick and morty
Is filthy frank Japanese?
I think this video only speaks for the older anime MALE viewers like almost all of them were like 30!XD What about girl weeaboos maybe their just not as bad.....
"I'll always be one step ahead of you because I read the manga." The fucking truth.
wtf am i watching xD
Did he just say "Oh shit mom"?
Holy shit Frank, I gotta say, Whenever I have shitty day, I find one of your videos and I just get happy all the sudden
You might be weeboo if:

-you hate the sound of the shakuhachi but claim to love japanese music
- know how to play hanafuda and force your family to play it every "family game night"
-scream DESU!!!! everytime someone mentions the hawaiian island of Kauai
-claim japanese women are the most perfect mates on earth.
My waifu is Bernie Sanders.
Does he actually know how to speak Japanese? If so, doesn't that kinda make him a weeaboo?
You should take it a step further and criticize KPOP fans
People need to realize Weeaboos aren't Otakus, BUT 
both are offensive terms in Japan.
Filthy frank is a independent black women who don't need no man
Cory in the house!!!!!!!!
I
FUUUUUCK We Are Invaded!!!!
Everyone Run!!!
But First Can I Have A Pussy Please???
The Japanese do like fucking underage boys and girls though.
Is he japanese?
Lol its funny how half of the weaboos you showed are white and fuckin fat as hell
Frank,
I need your help. My brother has become a weeaboo. How can I cure him of this disease?!?!?
My favorite anime is definitely Full House!
6:18 wtf graduation music
Ah..somebody tell me please what anime is in the picture from 1:18
I love Japanese films (lots of foreign films) and would visit japan but these people are annoying
I agree don't make fun of anime but you can make fun of ethnic groups
I like how my local anime store trolls the weebs by dedicating a section of the store for Disney's Frozen merch.
I've heard of this and I'm glad I have seen it
whats a weaboo?

meh
weeaboos are so sad
Mrs. Puff is my waifu.
I'm sitting here watching this in a sasuke costume
I lost it when he said hey boss
im think about learning how to tie a nose after how many sad people their are in this world
This was actually very informative. I use to think weeaboo was just an insult to anyone who liked anime. I guess I am lucky to have never encountered a true weeaboo in life or online.
I showed this to my mom and she actually laughed pretty hard.

everybody hates Chris is my favourite anime
When you are trying to realize what a weeaboo is and then you find a perfect example of it in your school...

ermmm i do not know if im considered as a weeaboo because i love anime and i learned japanese through watching anime. But i dont give a damn about haters because it's their opinion bruh. Another thing is, i dont boast about being able to read and write japanese because only assholes who want to be japanese do that. I'm a proud citizen of my country. i dont rlly wanna be japanese because i see huge flaws in its community. And i also have a weeaboo friend. She hates weeaboos but she's a damn weeaboo too -.- She says that weeaboos are people who only like japan for anime. Thats logic right deyr (sarcasm) my hands are tired
ravioli ravioli what is in the pocketloli
just me or does weeaboo Jones scare the shit outta me...
Dear Mr.Franklin, You are a hypocrite. You are speaking Japanese in this video so you are a weaboo . Oh, and you were not pronouncing all the Japanese in the video correctly trust me I would know i watch Attack On Titans.
Whenever Salamander Man or any Franku characteru plays the recorder, it's always Land of Hope and Glory.
2:04 I think Frank is channeling a bit of Woody Allen here.
Classic
I'm a simple roleplayer. And weeaboos should just stop. And stop using the word, "otaku" because it's an offensive word to Japanese people. And stop trying to learn Japan from anime and go to classes and not look like a total idiot.
Does this count as an anime profile? 

Is mayonnaise an instrument?
My favorite manga is mein kampf
My body pillow stands on its own now i died laughing crying and coughing

Suck me dry and call me Larry.
turn your volume up all the way and play 4:33
Thanks to you FilthyFrank or Franku (respect to this YouTuber), former friends of mine have bullied me. They keep bullying me. They spread rumors about me. I feel hurt. Call me butthurt or whatever, but it is the truth. They keep calling me trash. They won't stop when I tell them to. They want me to be hurt. Those of you who think I'm lying fine, don't believe me. But I am going though a tough time.

(in Romaji for you guys: Ore no kurozetto no naka ni yudayajin ga futari irunda. Ryouhou tomo shinderu.)
Oh Filthy Frank, you filthy troll

EDIT: 6:29 "We have to run!" is really "I love Macs, haha" (or Mickey D's, Makku could be either lol)

Well, I thoroughly enjoy anime. I'm not fully
Japanese, but I still practice it's culture and since my ethnicity is listed down as Asiannnn.... WHAT AM I.
Damn Daniel...
That weeaboo song... beautiful.
That pigeon was angrily commenting before you uploaded the video.

Pan the camera to the left, that pigeon was probably cross eyed as fuck, wearing an Attack on Titan shirt, and wearing a bright blue wig while clutching a body pillow.
Hey b0ss!! tarting at 1:56 you sounded exactly like this weeaboo that does anime reviews. I think his channel is called forneverworld or some shit like that I seriously though you were imitating the cancer.
Anime is cancer
* insert American show here * is the best anime ever
Filthy frany, you need to do a roast video coving bronies too, that shit needs to be exposed
so wait am I a weeaboo if I cosplay for possibly anime, but mostly games and would love to just visit Japan or possibly live there cause I respect their culture? Please tell me I'm not!! üò¢
My favorite anime is Auschwitz tapes
3995 weeaboos
Some kid at my school thinks he can speak Japanese, and has EVERYTHING attack on Titan, I like the show to but... That's waaaaaaaaaaaaay to far everything he talks about is AoT and his bag is eren with some face mask and it's just fucking weird
I went to Barnes & Noble a few months ago to buy a simple book when I passed the manga aisle. There was a huge commotion over there so I went to go check it out. Some girl was dressed up as some gothic anime/manga, idk, character. The cringe was so real. I almost passed out. I never want to go back there again ;_;
his weeb impression was so accurate it made me cringe
what's the difference.
I genuinely feel sorry for these people....
A moment of silence for all the weeaboos out there.
why does he talk like that?
King of the Hill is my favorite anime
WUH WUH WUH WHEARE THE SOUBTITLES?

Dragon dildos..... gotta catch em all!
I just watch anime and have a Natsu pic as my avatar on Facebook but I'm not like a freaking' weaboo.
this is the dumbest video I have seen
this girl in my school ran down the hallway with her arms to her sides, as if she was going to frontflip into a pool, and then she goes to her friend and does a peace sign and goes "ni-hau kai lan"... isnt that a kids show? idk but it was really wierd
I agree with almost everything you're saying frank, though, just because somebody has an anime picture for their avatar doesn't make them a bad person at all. This is just my opinion, please don't flame the hell out of me!
My favorite anime is food fight. Look the trailer up on YouTube.
you should seriously consider professional voice acting my friend
You should make an album with original music George I'm sure a lot of people would be interested in it.
the Thomas the tank engine bit killed me
I tell PPL I'm a weeaboo
and
I say a low-key on.. And watching this, I am a very low-key weeaboo
Oh, don't talk shit about Attack on Titan. :D
Weaboo for lyf!
I have to replay his impressions of how weaboos think Japanese people talk several times. They are fucking hilarious and he sounds like an actual anime character (NOT A JAPANESE PERSON)
I just have 1 question my profile picture is from ffxiv a game I play daily when I'm off work does that make me a weeb like I'm truly curious xD I could honestly give 2 shits about Japanese culture id like to travel there just cause I like traveling to new places.
tfw franku being just a bit serious about any issue speaks (or sings) the truth
RIP
He's the prophet of reality.
wtf this was uploaded 2014, feels like this was uploaded just a few months ago..
the helicopter though...lmao
The fucking subs XD gg lmao don't turn them on XD
most funny thing people are now afraid from word weeaboos and call themselfs as otaku. would be cool if franku made video about it. that weeb and otaku is same trash
perfect southpark episode
anime




ha





prepare for real life hentai rape
Papa, Am i a weeaboo if i like anime? i think i have the illness.
He's right you know
0:09 stop using false subs xD
"In my closet are two fat people, both of them are dead" xDDDDD
i have a hanzo sword does that make me a weeaboo
Im a weeaboo too orange is the new black :3
Does he really Sound like that or he is doing that voice on purpose
Am I already a Weaaboo?
4:09 XD
He is half japanese but I love how he just like pretends to like not have any clue about his culture at certain points
I fap to airplane instruction videos from the 80s
Hey b0ss keep it, you make great videos b0ss! As for the weeaboos. Chill the fuck out, it's alright to like anime but don't fucking over do and start thinking your Japanese. Also unless you are studying some sort of martial arts, than please don't go around buying sword's and shit... I see enough people with cancer as it is. Also lets have a reality check, Naruto is fucking fake, so let me smash your dreams right now, the real martial art of Ninjutsu isn't what you fat fuckers think it is. So get a life and quit fucking passing this cancer on to others!
Weebs going to japan like
-Where are the subtitles?

Best joke ever xD

I've had so much sex with my body pillow that it stands on it's own now.
Eheheh, my waifu's coming alive.
And don't talk shit about Attack on Titan. It's a really good show.
My youtube crashed when frank said," everybody gets shit."
Could this be a sign?
god i love him but that voice hurts my ears
Guess what fandom I am.
i thought filthyfrank is just a weird obnoxious fuck. hes actually really hilarious lol.
my favorite anime is king of the hill

Plz do a I hate anime vid
he sounds cool in Japanese
I'm one of those people that have an anime avatar
I like anime but it's really annoying when it's every FREAKING where like damn
Anime is WAY over done
Forget Weaboos, Bronies, Furries, All these Factions...Must be gone
Same goes for bronies and furries...
So wait... Weeaboos are real? I thought it was a shitty insult that basement dwelling no life's use to describe people making parody anime accounts on YouTube?
Calling someone a weeaboo by trolling them is similar to someone grouping "image clarity" to "graphics" when playing video games, much like grouping "pickles" with "cake"... Yeah, the difference is so obvious yet completely universal.
wtf did I just watch..
wow man, your italian is so good, sounds like if you were actually born in spain...
Kiss x sis my fav
It's like he's never seen a pigeonüòÇüòÇ
Filthy frank should be president.....
I kek'd at Cowboy Tanaka.
person who watches anime just a little

Otaku (me)

weeaboos... ._.
How to spot a weeaboo: People who go on this fucking video commenting "I watch [Insert anime here] and roleplay. Does that make me a weeaboo".
hey, since nobody in Japan really talks like anime characters do (as Frank demonstrates with all the exasperation), does anyone have any idea where that overacting comes from?
you are live dod?
Laughing too hard at this I had to stop
god damn dude your throat must be a wreck doing that voice all the time
My favorite anime is south park
Fucking weebs
Ughhhh I FUCKING HATE GODDAMN WEABOOS
Lol my art style looks like animu
If I am asian and I have an anime pfp does that mean I am double weeaboo or half weeaboo?
Dem tenders though
Cory in the House is the best anime ever
So schmitty
Weaboos should kill themselves
I like dragon ball
I'm not a fan of it but I like to watch it sometimes when I'm dead inside :|
you know what's worse than a weeaboo? someone who fucking opens a video saying "i have two dead jews in my closet" and thinks that's an appropriate joke???
What he accualy said in the beginning was "Welcome" "welcome to the filthy frank show" "want to know something really special?" "I have two Jewish people in my closet" "there both dead."
My favorite anime is the holocaust.
this isnt a anime avatar, this is my real face
We need a weeaboo holocaust
I like anime but I hate Japan 
help.
my favourite anime is cars
For once have I felt the picture I use perfectly fits the comments. A mix and mash of every emotion with just a drop of substance abuse. Or maybe that last one is just me.
good job you've had so much sex with a body pillow. I wish i had that ability but i have my right hand for that.
Go fucking drink bleach
and otaku proud where? xdddd
Hold the fuck up, is that PeanutButterGamer at 9:58??
Hah, Jokes on you filthy frank I'm part Japanese so I can have katana collections, body pillows, and watch shit anime. But I don't... So does that make me an americaniboo?
holy shit, rofl this guy should be a voice actor for anime, he can do the "protagonist" voice too well
Are you a weeb if u want to play their games and try to learn Japanese so you don't have to fucking Google what they're saying? Animes cool too I guess, whatever they show on adult swim.
(I wonder how many angry weeaboos I can conjure...) Boku no Pico is best anime... Oh and Attack on titans and Fairy Tale are the absolute worst.
What's hilarious to me is when i'm on iFunny and see a weeaboo call furries autistic. I get that furries make sexual art with those humanoid animals, which weirds the shit out of me, but furries aren't the ones who have "loli" (which is essentially child pr0n) which, to me, is 100 times more cancerous than a werewolf with big tits and a fat ass. Call me what you will, but I've always found weeaboos to be more cancerous than furries. And that's saying a lot.
Another amazing video man hahaha every time I'm sad, I promise you, I come to your videos and I always cheed up thank you Frank thank you xD
THERE ARE TWO FOREIGNERS IN MY CLOSET AND THEY ARE PROBABLY DEAD
Ha
i do just like watching anime but weaboos do make me want to kill myself
I fucking love Mein Kampf, it's like my favourite manga.
0:09 Why you got two dead Jews in your closet Franku?
Corey in the house XD Great reference to booby streamer (insert name here)
in the beginning that's where they are
I saw my first weaboo today, it's spreading!
Frank, you should make a video about furries/fursuiters
4:10 killed me
If I dressed up as an attack on titan character and got all the shit for the outfit and then ran through my school with the themesong playing on my loud ass phone while I make 3DM gear noises...does that make me a weaboo?
what is the rest of the vid tho
i'm cryin
i love it
i really feel like this guy needs to teach some newcomers at my friends geekmeeting. we just try to talk about some anime and stuff we like about japan and there they are, fat twelve year olds saying "konnichi wa, oppai wa daisuki HAHAH" and me crying in the corner trying to talk to some chill animefans. #calmtheweeaboos


pls
The struggle of being white, but being a military child and being raised in Japan.
i need a gif of weeaboo jones walking
Now . I watch anime too . I watched it a lot . Shounen , Comedy , Romance , Echhi , Sci-Fi, or anything you name it . And I try to speaked through them by myself . Now I can speak them clearly but I dont say it on other people . Sometimes when I watch anime with no english subtitles , I can understand it by how they pronouce it and how they react to it . So I'm not a weeaboo , right ?
Is he always yelling?
hahaha this is great XD
Anime sucks
I like anime and I kinda roleplaye as an anime character. I like this video, I find this quite funny. When people say they don't  like anime I just say that's  your opinion. If you don't  like anime you don't  like anime.
CUCK CUKC
Weaboo's - Go Away Please
You Give Nightmares...üò®üò±
üòß sad
I love hentai
I want to have a son, just so I can name him, Cowboy Tanaka.

Don't worry I'm not a weeaboo I learn how to speak Japanese and I only watch samurai champloo
„Åì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ filthy „Åï„Çì
Hold up... Frank's 52?
Filthy Frank should be a voice actor
"Fuck out"
Question~ am I a weab?

I just recently got into anime (within the past 3 months) and I am very interested in Japanese culture, religion, and the language. I have been interested in the culture of Japan since I was in the fifth grade, and that was strengthened when I  learned about WW2 in school around the 6th or 7th grade.(I'm 19 now BTW). Soon after I became interested in language as a whole, learning little bits from multiple languages, such as Spanish, German, Japanese, french...(not via rosetta stone)
later, i became interested in Shinto, one of the main religions of japan, the other being Buddhism. now, im into anime (thanks to a friend, i asked him not to)

So, with all that in mind, am i a filthy fucking weeaboo?
i love how the subtitles in the beginning are misleading hahahaha
Sama
Your voice is disgusting
"Don't talk shit about Attack on Titan...
... It's a really good show."
I will admit, that one made me crack up. It's only funny because a) it isn't and b) read the fucking manga you weeb
Omg the mangoos and animoos are da best. My favorite animoo is The Ellen Degeneres Show and Oprah. My favorite mangoo is Twilight and 50 Shades of Grey. ^0^ _  0_o
filthy franks voice is an ear rape
weeaboos need to live in Japan, learn the ACTUAL culture and become citizens
r-rosetta stone
I collect swords guess im a weeaboo fag now :v
I can't never get tired of this video! :D
filthy fuckin weeaboos
9:59 PBG?
Are Dan and Phil weeaboos?
Naruto and one piece are overrated, now Cory in the house, that's the good stuff
I think everyone went through a weeaboo stage at some point...
I mean I like anime
jing jong bong tong lol (trying to funny not being racist)
wanna hear a dirty joke?....white horse fell in the mud
I don't know why I keep coming back to this video. I just like it too much, I guess. He does, however, make some pretty good points. And like he said, "Just don't bring that shit near me." If only the weebs/bronies would keep their shit to themselves. I'm a brony, but I'm not all flamboyant about it. I, and a surprisingly small number of bronies keep shit to ourselves. It's apalling.
Why the fuck would anyone ever want to be a Weeaboo? The Japanese are all midgets and ugly as fuck. 
No offence to Japanese people.
song name?
hes 52
What's name of the violin song at the back ground guys can you guys helpe me please leave acommnet bellow
The correct term is "Transasian" weeabo is a slang
This video made me laugh so hard you are a legend frank
SEX AND VERTEBRAES
"Hay Bows" XD
Song 2:48?
Quick, they're all in one place! Detonate the nuke! Those usually tend to do a pretty good at killing Japanese things...
picture of teen egoraptor was a nice touch
you must perform the Filthy Frank ritual:
chant "kill yourself" and "gibe de pusi b0ss" repeatidly until all the lights dim. then, you must call upon the demons of red dick's urethra by saying this message: O demons of urethron, I urge unto you. Clense the internet of all cancer and allow filthy frank into eternal dominion of the kill yourself federation,
omg i hate anime and those people. this is so true.
One guy had an European sword, and CWC (The tard with the yellow Sonic/Pikachu mutant thing) is legit assburgers.
Wat was hat piano when you wanted to be thomas the train?
What is that noise at 6:00
What is the explanation between this man speaking japanese on a fluent-native level?
There's a weeaboo at my school that says he's an otaco. What is an otaco? Nothing comes up when I google it. Besides like taco delivery things or something.
cowboy tanaka xDD
Does it make me a weeaboo if I dressed up as a Kirito on Halloween and wore the costume for 3 days after halloween?

ok but i don't think there's anything wrong with cosplaying, unless these cosplayers are actually fetishizing japan.
Anime is basically intense cartons with a shit ton of episodes and seasons (depending on which one you're watching) I like bleach, deathnote, full metal alchemist brotherhood, and Tokyo ghoul, they're ok, but here's reality, when you are a weaboo, you don't wanna be the real worlds version of Japanese, you wanna be anime's version of Japanese, you want colored hair, and a weapon that's twice the fucking size of your body, and you want life to be epic, but, life is as epic as you wanna make it
(Ps, toy story 3 was best anime, very good sir, very good, lol)
How do you change your face so much
I speak bird, and I know what that pigeon is saying:
"Y U H8 ON MY CULTURE  BRUH IMMA TURD ON UR CAR NOW lol noob"

Paris Japanese community is "very individualist" and 
that they prefer to not publicly assert their Japanese identity but adapt to the culture in Paris
-wikipedia

So non-asian get shit when trying to adapt to Japan while Japanese people can adapt to any culture they like.
Fuck you filthy frank, you fucking nigger asshole. stop making fun of anime, shithead.
wth is his voice?
You know your kind is hated when the bronies laugh at you...
#thisismyhouse
This is pretty much 99.9% of the mmo-c community

Lel turn on the subtitles at exactly one minute.
I watch anime, collect figures/anime items and japanese culture is my thing. But I am actually japanese IRL. Does that make me a weeaboo?

IM A WEEABOO ME LMFAO WHY IS THIS SO FUNNY AND OFFENSIVE IM CRYIMGDSHK
I love Filthy Frank. He's wonderful. I like all of his videos. ;3 Does that make me a Frankaboo????? Juuuust kidding!

I like anime and I was learning a bit of Japanese, I'm fascinated with the culture and would love to visit. I wouldn't consider myself a weeaboo as I don't insert myself into animes nor do I cosplay or pretend to be an anime character. Fuck, I don't even own any anime merchandise except for 2 posters and 1 plushie. I do, however, roleplay but usually it's creative writing and in a more realistic manner.... But anime is very fun in a fantasy rp considering that you can do absolutely anything. I'm sure if you went to a cosplay convention and dressed up just at the convention, kind of like going to the renaissance faire and dressing up, then you wouldn't be considered a weeaboo.....

But..... My cousin is dating a weeaboo... She doesn't leave the house unless she's in cosplay and she only cosplays guys such as Edward Elric, Inuyasha, or Kakashi. Well, not always, I mean sometimes she wears cat ears and tail instead..... She'll talk/act/cosplay every where... In the store.... to children.... It's a little terrifying actually. I, honestly, don't go places with her unless she's wearing 'normal' clothes.

Please don't feed into weeaboo habits. There's a time and place for everything........

Oh and I gave up on learning Japanese because I'm busy. All I can do is introduce myself. "Watashi wa Josie-desu. Dozo Yoroshiku." Fuck no, I'm not going to say my last name first. Don't want people calling me by that shit. xD
As an avid anime watcher, I think we can all agree that the 2016 Presidential Campaigns are the best animes. Like, have you seen the shit they do? It's crazy.
I own a combat sword a dragon katana a Chinese war sword and machete I only have them because you feel so empowered holding them and I personally hate anime
Does your voice ever hurt after your videos? xD
"Sharingan...Rosetta Stone" I CAN'T. THIS GUY IS FUCKING HILARIOUS. GET A SUB FROM ME YOU GLORIOUS MOTHERFUCKER

Do furries next I'm a furry so make it extra offensive I approve frank

i hope you guys realize his captions don't match what he's saying most of the time
OH god the weeaboos, weeaboos everywhere
Follow your dreams son
yeah these people are annoying but, I can see why they reject their own culture in today's society( in the United states's )culture specifically "pop culture" people can act sooo dumb and rude eg. Donald trump, a politician XD
every dislike is one dead kitten. One like is 10 chromosomes
Vaping make me feel like Thomas the Tank Engine
My favorite animes are Supernatural and Sherlock
Follow your dreams son
Did anyone else see that the hooters picture was from the worst of dimmensions, Jacksonville, FL
Everyone who disliked this is a weeaboo

White people are like this. There is a anime club in my school, none of the people who are closer to the culture and like anime go, it is just depressed white people who also for some reason like kpop as well?¬ø
if i spent my childhood in japan but im australian can i call myself german?
Call of Duty black ops 3 is my favorite anime
Ikr, stop fapping to minecraft porn you fucking weaboos.
hahahah i love this man so for weabs here anime is cartoons pls stop making anime's reputation so bad you guys are the reason why i hate shit right now but i still watch it also im a weab i admit it well i dont really know. im not offended of it being cartoons and i dont argue on people who watch anime asnd said facts that the anime i like is shit but im offended when people say that when they dont have any idea how good it is cause they havent watch it. so basically im only offended on the majority of people who haent watch it and say its shit. also i squeal like any other fangurl when i see my fav character but unlike them i dont claim that character my husband or brother or boy friend.   AM I A WEAB YOU DECIDE I AM HONEST BOUT THIS THINGS SO COMMENT AND SEE IF IM OFFENDED
What realm does Frank lives in?
...can the idiots in the comment sections just stop? The majority don't even know what you guys are talking about. I'm not a fan of anime but, really? You guys are idiots. Weaboos are people who take things too far, regular people aren't like that WOW you learned something new today. And the majority of you guys are calling out people and calling them faggots, gays, and telling them to go die? GROW UP ;) just some future advice. You're welcome. 

Btw, everything filthy frank says is correct you guys are just being idiots. Try not to embarrass yourselves ;)
I mean... If im getting a fleshlight.... might as well get one from the place that has been making them for a while now.
The pink guy & weeaboo jones just made me die laughing.
well actually I do have a sword collection for decoration and it includes some actual authentic katana.
this has nothing to do with Japanese culture. I just like katanas there just simply cool.

and don't hassle me about my profile pic haven't changed in 5 years and don't feel like it...... I actually don't know how to
Liek if curry in teh haus is ur faveret amine alsho
Papa Franku, thank you. Your teaching of weeaboos has enlightened me to become a weeaboo missionary. I am going around from social media to soial media, giving them free reality checks.
Thank god I'm a gamer and otaku.
There was a girl in my school last year who, literally everyday, wore the complete outfit from attack on titan

That moment when your classmate says anime is stupid and 2/3 of the class gasps and 2/3 of the class never talks to her ever
there should be a key on the keyboard that looks kinda like quotation marks, but is used for showing sarcasm

Shouldn't talk shit about anime.
Turn on subtitles when frankoo is talking in japan
Everyone who dislikes is a weeaboo. Stop spreading cancer ;c 1 like = 1 dead weeaboo
I've been watching anime ever since I was young. Spongebob Squarepants, Danny Phantom, Fairly Oddparents, Courage the Cowardly Dog, etc ;)

Someone told anime was just short for animation. Didn't really know it was meant for Japanese cartoons. Thought it was for every cartoons.
What the fuck did I just watch
What's the sad song he uses when Weeaboo Jones comes?
Frank do a video about how you feel about bronys
I love mango, there's nothing you can do about it!
I have an anime profile picture in every social media XD welp shit
Y'all are like anti-weeb weebs. Chill the fuck out.

I don't think you know what "Kage Bushinn No Jutsu" means. It means (literally translated) Art of the shadow doppelganger
Can I not go to Japan now or would that make me a weaboo
This is amazing XD
Make fun of jews in your next episode

my avatar is not an anime its from gorillaz just saying
A message to all you weeaboos:
Roses are red
Violets are blue
Anime is cool
But not you.
:)
Some people saying anime like attack on titan are bad, but they can't even name the main character without having to Google it. Like at least try watching it before u say the anime series is complete garbage, but if its not your thing who cares its like taking someone's opinion of a game they played 15 minutes of; completely invalid.
chin chan #1 anime : ^)
I couldn't stop laughing. The fucking cowboy thing. Oh my God.
lol...People with anine pics bringing up non animated shows and sayin it's the best anime....bitch plz, shut up
Your right weaboos do suck dick .fuck you  you motherfucking attack on titan loveing  clit shiters
people be like, don't hate on my cosplay because I'm"large". no honey...you're fat. wear spanks to smooth that out or go on a jog. don't just prance around with a shield of ignorance. 

we seriously can't keep "accepting" obesity as okay. fkn tumbler. yes there are large women Adel, any model in an Avenue mag bla bla bla. they are "large" but it is a "heathy" large.
Haha my friend drew my profile picture for me xD
Seriously though, weebs might be a bit annoying but they never really bothered me much :)
Do what you wanna do man
Seriously God Bless! those poor people who work at anime shops, comic book stores, or anywhere that sells anything even slightly anime or Manga related. Those people have to deal with weeaboos on a daily basis.
Cory in the house I died
Anyone have a translation?
Herro my name is Cowboy Tanaka
Lol I keep watching this cause it's so funny üòÇ
LOL, i agree
weeaboo Jones....mother of God
I do watch anime. I am learning Japanese. I love Japanese culture. But I am not obsessive about anime, I am taking time to learn all three alphabets (hiragana, katakana, and kanji) and the proper ways to use them, and trying to save up for a short trip so I can see the infamous cities and vast country side.

Weeaboos put in a bad name for all of us -_-

I love you.
jesus christ he probably made more money from this vid alone than I will ever make
Can someone help me out here? 
I love watching Anime 
I love Japanese culture 
I have assorted japanese merchandise (studio ghibli mostly, no katana swords! xD) and a few manga comics 
Also I have been trying to learn Japanese for years now because I think it's very pretty and I know multiple japanese songs as a result
However I am not fluent, haven't been to Japan, (although I do educate myself on the proper ettiqtte and customs) don't know many japanese people and do not call myself japanese because I was born and live in Scotland. 

Am I a Weaboo?
I collect Medieval swords. Does that make me uh... um.... A Medievalphile? uhhh....

I mean, they're because I love history. You could probably call it an obsession. But believe me, my longsword gets all the pussy. Get it? My longsword isn't really a sword. Get it?




It's my penis.
5:10 i fucking lost it  "Herro my name is, cowboy tanaka"
There are two thousand people that love this video and then there is 3,000 weaboos that shat their pants while simultaneously pounding on their keyboards breathing hella heavy
From his neighbors perspective, this sounds like a guy with a weird voice arguing to a Japanese man about hentai xD

OH HAIIIIIIII :D

... I totally do not have a senpai or want to speak Japanese...
I like your regular batman voice.
My best friends friend is a weeaboo and that person is my close friend LOLOLOLOOLOLOLOL
Good thing I'm an otaku
Anime should be eliminated.
I'm watching the hentai for the plot... I swear...
I watch a lot of anime but I don't think I'm Japanese and I'm not that obsessed. XD
a youtuber called laust pause is the biggest weaboo..
My WAIFU is Papa Frank.
XD
i just watch anime like these guys at my school call me a weeaboo and im like omfg u have an aot pocket watch a wallet (well i have an aot wallet and im getting a new one) and u have made the blades from aot so how am i a weeaboo, so yeah lol
you have two¬†jews in your closet
and both of them died

~ a Japanese person who just ruined the moment
Is this his regular voice? Or does he do it on purpose?
I'm conflicted because I dislike anime but there's this girl in my art class who wears attack on titans clothes to school and is really cute. What do. (Also by attack on titan clothes I don't mean like a hoodie, I mean full fucking cosplay.)
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
weeaboos and bronies, the most cancerest things thats happned to the world
Me : I don't really like anime.

Weeaboo : BITCH MY WAIFU WILL GET HER KAME HAME HA SHIT ON YOU I WILL SLICE YOU THE FUCK UP WITH MY KATANA! 

Me : (Kills self)
wtf did I just watch
LMFAO starting at 2:32
boku no piko is so good
Damn lot of butthurt weaboos down there i gotta admit i love anime and their culture but you don't see me buying katanas cosplaying and everything in that video
Ok the start of this has subtitles right. I decided to see what would happen if I put YouTube subtitles on and just read what it said it is so retarded.
I don't understand all this toxicness in the comment section. I don't believe stupid shit about Japan or its culture I'm just very interested in it (art, food, people, history, language etc.) Is it so wrong to have an interest towards something? I see here are japanese people telling how cancerous people who like their culture are. I don't get it. I have never tried to be Japanese and wouldn't even want to. I am from where I am but I still want to learn more about the culture. It is a different thing. Tell me why is it so wrong to like things that differ from your own culture. (My comment doesn't have anything to do with Frank, only these stupid comments)
i don't like anime(and this is how you build a weeaboo trap mates)
HNNNGNNGNG
Fuck weaboo's!!
Top 5 best anime characters:
1.Patrick
2.Charles Darwin
3.Ezio Auditore
4.Pink Guy
5.A guy named Krisko from my country ( Bulgaria )
I'm in agreement about this. There is also Japanese people that wish they were American and wear all the western styles, and try to add English to their Japanese. so kind of goes both ways.
subs not dubs, franku
subs not dubs
These days anybody who watches anime or has the slightest interest in Japan is labeled a weaboo lmao
next target : FilthyFrang
Me: "Hey, quiet! Do you hear that?"
Friend:" Hear what? There's nothing."
Me: " Shhh....quiet! I hear sirens....and they're calling out to you!...WEEA BOO WEEA BOO!"
Favorite anime: thats so Raven, Super Beaver, TV Filthy Frank, KC undercover
I have a picture of America from Hitalia as my profile picture. That being said, I'm not a weeaboo. I watch and enjoy anime, still not a weeaboo. I know like, five words from the Japanese language by accident, still not a weeaboo. I like this video, it tells all those assholes at school that call me a weeaboo to fuck off.
im not interested in japan ;-;
theres this native alaskan kid i know and he literally ate out my ass when i mentioned i dont really watch anime. and i told him hes not even japanese nor does he speak the language so i didnt see why he was so offended
I love Japanese culture, food, language (I'm trying to learn kana, and speak a little Japanese so I would get used to it.), history, festivals, anime/manga, Japanese people, anything in Japan except whaling,  but I also love my own culture that I would jump out of joy when a foreigner says that they like our culture. Does that mean I'm not a weeaboo?
Holy shit... I was with a Weeaboo for 2 years.. no wonder I went insane. HAHAHAHAHA!
If I act like a wannabe Frank in Japan, will I be accepted?
my favorite anime

Hannibal is my favourite anime.
AHAHHAHAHHA WEEABOOBS
Kek. Some people don't know that "otaku" and "weeaboo" mean the same thing.
whisper japanese to my ears papa
Some people say they aren't a weeaboo but there an otaku... but...


Has anyone noticed its essentially the same thing?
Considering the fact that this character is officially described as "everything a person should not be." George Miller probably doesn't condone the hatred of weeaboos, and actually thinks  the filthy virgin animals should be allowed to exist. Gigs' up, go home everyone.
Favorite anime: Local construction sites, Cringe Compilations
best main characters: Stan Wawrinka, Donald Trump and Bill Gates

Theres a weeaboo at my school, she dyes her hair, brings comics and figures, calls people racist when she does the most racist accent when she speaks "japanese" she calls her freinds after amime characters, she also believes that a character is alive and shags her in hersleep, and she weres cosplay.

I find nothing wrong with liking other cultures,  but some people take things a little TOO seriously.
YOU BETTER SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT ANIME YOU FUCKEN SCRUB I BET YOU DONT EVEN GET PUSSY I TELL YOU WHAT IVE BEEN PLAYING ANIME GAMES AND THEY ARE THE FUCKEN BEST SO SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FUCKEN SHIT

Do the Japanese have their own version of YouTube? The only Asians I see here are Indians, Chinese (using vpn) and sometimes Koreans.
I'm excluded!
I just noticed at 3:51, Frank uses "boku" to refer to himself when he speaks unscripted japanese. (Instead of the gender-neutral "watashi" or the manlier "ore") I like that.
Cory in the House is the Best anime

My favourite anime is pornhub
weabs that come to japan, the first stuff they hear is "WELCOME TO THE RICE FIELDS MOTHERFUCKER"
When you get 3k dislike your doing something right
If you're actually Japanese, does that make you a weeaboo?
Rosetta Stone.
Weeaboos are why people abort their unborn fetuses
I LIKE COLLECTING WEAPONS BUT NOW I CANT GET KATANAS(which were a very important sword and could cut through great swords) BUT NOW A CAN'T. THANKS CUSTOM INK!

Fanboy and Chum Chum is my favorite anime
the pigeon was a  weeaboo for carrier pigeon for the weeaboo United
the way he describes and makes funny of weeaboo is very accurate to all the people   i know who are like anime and don't want to admit that you're weeaboo such as having a sword collection speaking Japanese and wanted to visit Japan he may be joking. But this is very true and accurate
Cough....
well I watch anime and I dressed as a scout for Halloween AND FOR ONLY HALLOWEEN so does that mean I'm a weaboo??
As a person who is indeed half Japanese I... This music part just hits me because I hate weaboos. :/ like I can understand people wanting to know about being Japanese but Jesus, I don't want people doing that shit, it's like mocking me
Owning a katana collection doesn't automatically make you a weaboo xD
butthurt weeaboo's
i fucking hate weeaboos :) i hope they all get a bit of cancer and kill all beaners
he is my idol lol 
i feel your pain

Filthy Frank, mai waifu. <3
anime is ok
fav anime is pigeon
7:54 - 8:05 cut the visuals...0-0...
I absolutely HATE it when people say they've held a sword and are a professional swordsman or swordswomen but then you hand them a proper two-handed sword and they drop it, they then go on to say : 'this isn't a real two-handed sword, it would be lighter' Most two-handed swords are freaking heavy! So DON'T say you are a PROFESSIONAL swordsman/women then drop the god dam sword kk?
ÁßÅ„ÅØ„É™„É≥„Ç¥„ÇíÈ£ü„Åπ„Çã

some of my favorite animus are homosuck spongebob and Harry Potter

you can't just say shit like that about anime alright... you cunt ass slut
you can't just say shit like that about anime alright... you cunt ass slut
bitch what the fuck
This video also applies to the scary ass Bronies. Like Frank said, there's a line between liking MLP then fapping to Twilight Clop porn.
Like Papu Franku said, just because you like anime doesn't mean you're a WEEABOO. People need to get that through their thick skulls. I enjoy anime, I have some merch.
they disrespect thier own culture by saying theyre japanese......goddamn shame i like anime and all but im just saying thats fucking fake as hell and the bad part about it is its mostly grown ppl mad at their own society because the dont have a life so they make up their own in an imaginary world of anime....please get a life DONT BE A WEEABOO
6:56 lmao
My favorite anime is attack on Titan
Just  my POV. I think mostly this starts as liking anime and manga. Then people learn that they are usually Japanese and begin learning little by little some terms and slight cultural differences. Some might be curious and research about the language (and learn it) and then the culture. I think that eventually they want to go to Japan. Idk but I see it as someone who is interested in a different culture, UNTIL they claim they're Japanese, show it off, only talk about that, have a false idea of life and so on. Idk, what do you think causes weaboos to appear? D: kill 'em before they lay eggs
Its so funny that Americans portray Asians as people with tiny, narrow eyes, but in anime its the exactly opposite, there are people with eyes covering their whole goddam face
AM I ANUME ANOUGH
Pork is a really good anime, you should try it.
Mad pussi
BOSS PLS GIVE ME THE PUSSY!!!!!!!!!! AHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA

THIS GUY IS THE MAN
FUCK YEAH
what the hell is haragona
Weeaboos go to THIS comment section and type in Japanese.
It's kind of annoying when people call everyone who likes manga or anime a weeaboo... just because you like those things doesn't mean you are obsessed with the culture and want to try to be one.
check is spelled cheque, as in "check out this cheque"
cheque your spelling next time nerd
Bleh.. ros... rosetta stone..
ures  a gay
+b0ss
wait why would you have that
Omg all these fucking 12 year old new fags fucking ruined this Youtube channel, such a shame I can't go into the comments section without a cringe factor anymore. Rip good comments, the only place to find some decent ones are on Frank's old channel, something these little kids don't know about god bless.
I have yet to find a channel more deserving of the title weeaboo than macapuff...


(P.S: Cory in the¬†house is the best animu)
xD omfg best episode
So this is where "Cory in the house is the best anime" Is from. U learn something new everyday
My profile picture use to be anime until something changed my life and I became a causal anime fan

SAO would have been more fitting than ATOT, but amazing video anyways.
4:34 is my proudest fap
I'm listening to what he's saying in the beginning, and, uh... Well, it doesn't sound like he's talking Japanese. I'm listening to the nasally-ness of it, and... is he speaking Korean?
YAS~Raven
its amazing how much lore there is in the filthy frank universe(es)
"where where where the subtitles??" LOL XD
Anime Sucks.
I love anime, I love the Japanese languageand would like to learn it, I love Japan, I love Japanese martial arts, I would love to go to Japan. But I still love being a nigger/cracker. I don't wanna be Japanese.
He's so damn fluent in both languages. Shit.

THANK YOU i watch like 2 anime and everyone calls me a weeaboo when one of my favorite songs is "America Fuck Yeah"
you sir are the lord of the internet
King of the hill is best anime
I only have a profile pic of an anime character because I didn't want to put my own...
Was that PBG..?
The Bible was obviously the best anime. The Book of Matthew was the best OVA and if you think otherwise kill yourself.
I have an excuse for my pic!! I didnt have anything else to put on here... Go ahead, talk shit about anime, its not like im going to come over to kill your whole family... right?
i mean... i have an anime pic but i just like anime. the only time i'll bash on you is if you bash someone who has an anime picture ONLY FOR THAT REASON. SOMEONE IS NOT A WEABOO FOR LIKING ANIME OR HAVING AN ANIME PICTURE. THIS IS THE 24TH TIME I'VE SAID IT. I'LL SAY IT 100'S OF TIMES. WATCH ME PORNHUB COMMENTS SECTION

my favorite anime is dead space
I fucking love this guy
waiting for you to roast emos
Seinfeld is my favorite anime
Well according to the dictionary definition I am not a weeb! I do realize I am a Canadian and no amount of anime related mediums could change that. However anime has influenced parts of my personality;  an example being I gained a big breast fetish (I know, they aren't as big as they are in anime and have come to terms with it, even making exceptions to comfort my loss)

I would buy merchandise such as manga,novels and anime only if it were to benefit the author/production studio and prompt for more books and extra seasons of series I like. Some figurines, posters and models wouldn't be too bad, however body pillows...that's only when it's I am in dire need of companionship

I do say some Japanese words, but when I hear myself I just cringe and stop and don't say anything like it for a couple of months

I can get why people watch hentai. There are many possibilities and situations that could happen in there that couldn't in real life(body proportions, xxx positions and many more), but it can be bad psychologically and it may affect expectations of men/women in real life. It's important to set a limit, balance your animated porn with real porn.

I also have a question:
Is there other words associating ultranationalism with a culture/ethnicity other then the Japanese? It would be quite discriminatory if say a brown person is obsessed with white culture
My favorite anime is pornhub
Need an example of weeaboos? Try any cringe compilation ever
this is so funny idky
this pissed me off
Why is that in anime, when its Japanese, the main male protagonist screams out and his voice sounds like he has lung cancer ?
My favorite anime, personally, is the Fresh Prince of bell air. I don't watch those shoujo anime like Gilmore girls
does he normally sound like this?
Omg Yasss! The song was great but the ukulele make it fucking amazingüòÇüòç
This killed me lmao.
My favorite anime has got to be The Little Panda Fighter. Really good, yet so underrated. Look it up, the animation is sexy, it gives me an orgasm.
"Kawaii in the streets 
Senpai in the sheets."
- Shit weeaboos say
Anime sucks ass

That awkward moment you realize you're a weeaboo...

I try to eat granola bar and then 2:36 happened and I almost fucking died.
Holy shit you sounded normal speaking japanese... I have no idea what to make of you accent afterward when you were speaking English. Do you just gargle a whole bottle of laxatives before every video? 

Anyway, nice video, sweet impersonations, well researched, 8/10 channel.
Oh wow, I just realized that I probably was weeaboo for short amount of time, (something about first 3 weeks when I started watching anime).
I like that you put the subtitles different from what you actually said in the beginning with the thing about what's in your closet OMFG
This comment section is literally all weaboos trying to act normal THEIR PRETENDING TO BE LIKE US.

Steven universe is my favorite anime
I'm a white person that likes anime. I own some merchandise and write fanfic. I do NOT however try to speak Japanese, dress like a stereotypical Asian girl, and make a complete and utter idiot out of myself. Call me what you will, but I don't think I'm doing anything wrong.
lol this was under the anime section
The middle of this went from 1 to art film real quick. And I like it. :)
Here is the Japanese I know.
ii tenki desu ne
Scrumpdiddlyumptious.
ÊúÄÈ´ò
Frankiboy you are the new fred of YouTube we needed one it was getting boring
Why are you so good at Japanese?
You know whats the saddest? I watch anime and I agree. Just calm your AMERICAN tits.
so what i cant collect swords without u comparing me to anime shit
I watch anime, I'm collecting manga, I have 2 posters from my favorite shows in my room (and btw I have full time job in IT too). I'm learning Japanese (through anime too, it's great way to learn more natural way to talk than formal texts in books, this is not only my opinion, my friend is a sworn translator and he says the same thing ) as my third language, English is not my primary language. I consider it as (one of) my hobby. I'm rather not offensive with it, I'm not trying to force someone to watch anime or something. I'm not cosplaying (it's wrong, seriously don't do that if you are not Asian, you would looks like total faggot in most of cases). Of course I'm watching anime always with original voice acting (like I'm watching all movies from other countries too) Dubbing is a shit (always, as I said, in every movie from all countries). 
Anyway, I started watching anime because I was bored to hell by 'murican movies and TV series (which are in 90% Neverending stories). I seen many in my life (according to my database, 1586 movies). So I wanted to watch something different, so I picked some anime series and that's how I started watching anime. 
You should be more open minded people. When someone is watching other things than you are, you should check it before you start hate it/him. It's pretty dumb of you if you hate something that you don't know anything about it. Author of this video said some things and he is right in general (even if he is acting way more dumb than all 'weebs' in the world), but most of people in comments are too dumb to understand that someone could be interested in things which they are not. Many of them says 'anime is gay' etc and then sits on their chair and starts watching random stupid 'murican comedy show. Even if someone IS a weeb, in most cases he/she is not offensive to that people, but anime haters are always offensive to all people which are interested in this. 
Anyway, you can call me weeb too, I rather don't care.
04:20 they're at least 14 (14 is the legal age of,you know what)

my favorite anime is thomas the tank engine
And it is SCRUPDILLITYUPSUCH
I've watched a lot of anime, the only merchandise I have is a captain levi key chain and an AOT poster I don't use. No anime profile pics, I have a cheap katana, but my dad got it for me because kill bill. I want to collect swords but that's because I'm a fencer. I tried learning Japanese once but got scared and ran away. Going to Japan would be dandy, Attack on Titan is good in my book. I know martial arts, but I liked martial arts before I knew what anime was. I seem to be hitting a few red flags for the wrong reasons. Don't worry, my school is super anti-anime. I know a good chunk of people who think anime=weeaboo.
This is my first filthy frank video, I feel like I'm being drawn in... Is this good? Is this okay?
also, a real red flag is when the only anime merchandise someone owns is all girly anime shit and they're surrounded by anime high school girls.
"What are you fucking gay?"
I thought house in Japanese was uchi.
I think Frank would be a good anime voice actor

my favourite anime is 420 call of star frank
Owning katanas are for fags, real men own Nambu brand guns
There are a fuckton of weeaboo-types at my school, I look pretty Asian, my family has Asian ancestors, I'm not very into anime (besides early 90s-mid 2000s anime), I haven't sat through an entire anime for years, I'm more into western animation, and most of my friends are very into anime.
A couple of my female friends call me "senpai", which just makes me cringe and makes me feel awkward more than any cringe compilation can.
When they have conversations about anime that I dislike or haven't seen before, they almost always ask me for my opinion.
I usually respond with 'I have not seen it', 'I don't really watch anime anymore', and etc.
This one nerd said "but you're Asian, don't you wanna know about and support your culture?" -- I have no idea if it was a joke delivered in the driest way possible, but I gave the benefit of the doubt.
That pushed me over the edge a bit and the thing that shocked them the most is when I said 'I haven't watched Dragon Ball Z, Pokemon, Digimon, and Yu-Gi-Oh since I was a kid; I don't like Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece; I haven't seen Attack on Titan, Kill la Kill, Fairy Tail, nor One Punch Man; I thought both Fullmetal Alchemist versions were alright, I never finished brotherhood and I forgot most of what happened; and I think most anime and manga is just bullshit that goes on way longer than it needs to... besides the Berserk manga because literally one guy makes that, and he takes a lot of breaks.'
Yeah, so that annoyed them. Lol
But at least they don't dress like facepalmworthy faggots and they look pretty normal, so that's good.
took me so long to get the Redneck Virgin joke
I don't like weeaboos :/
cowboy tanaka LMAO
JUST GON' SAY DIS ONE TIME FOR ALL Y'ALL IGNNT SONS UH BITCHES... ANIME LITERALLY MEANS ANIMATION IN JAPANESE. YOU KNOW WHAT ANOTHER WORD FOR ANIMATION IS? FUCKING CARTOONS. SO, YES, ANIME IS JAPANESE CARTOONS YOU STUPID FUCKS

Is it a bad thing that I have a Filthy Frank body pillow?
Is that the Kunai?
You should have a serious channel and upload a video here every  other week or month and then the opposite on the serious channel
My favourite anime would have to be a tie between Max and Ruby and The Cheeta girls 2.
:O you don't look 52 I thought you were around early 30's
Cory In the House lmao
I do hate weeaboos, and I think my friend is turning into one. Like, the shit he says is so ridiculous. One day he said "I wish anime girls were real so that I can marry one." And me and my other friends were just so confused and shocked. And as for me, I watch little anime. I don't have time to dedicate an entire day watching it. I just watch JoJo, Love Live and that's honestly it. I also realised that one of those posters was a poster of a Love Live character, but no one cares probably. I bet if my friend watched this he'd be really pissed and would write a really stupid comment defending his case.
Wahhhhhhhhh (hey boss)
I came back to this video to read the newer comments, but now it seems like this is where weeaboos that are in denial come to get reassurance.
50-1 ratio likes to dislike.
hes got a element of facial feature expression of  shock g's  character humpty hump very funny.
9:56 is that asuna from sao?
My friend refuses to date anyone who isn't Asian.  She also likes a kid a year younger then her that moved to our school from Korea who can't speak English.  It needs to stop.
(the part where he started to moan like in an anime girl and woke up the neighbors got me. if I keep watching these at night then I might end up waking everyone up.)
I hate attack on titans
the biggest weaboo on earth is no other than...



HONEYBOOBOO
I am an anime fan and I fuckin love this video üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

This video speaks the truth.
im not a weeaboo for sure because i didnt even know anime existed till last year. Plus I haven't watched anime in about 6 months so.... ya. But my brother Aaron keeps calling me a weeaboo because I want to go to Japan for high school. I mean come! So what I want to move to Japan for high school?! Me and my friend though it would be fun. Lean a new language, go to a better school, meet newer people, and look around. But apparently because I watched anime 6 months ago and now want to go to japan for high school that makes me a weeaboo. It bothers the crap out of me when he does this! I know im not Japanese culture and im not trying to learn Japanese off of anime! I dont have a single weapon besides a be be gun and i have 0 clothes or wigs to cosplay in. So im literally no where near the weeaboo zone. Ugh!
I'm here because of jkn haha
"Chotto bosu" lol go look it up on Google translate
person : calls me a weeaboo 
me: has never watched anime, only speaks japanese
me: ok
wait, so if I collect weapons I am a weeaboo?
wants to learn Japanese, hates all anime, but likes Nintendo, am I a weeaboo? I don't really think so
Japanese try to act American more than we try to act Japanese.

Wanting your anime crush (or really any fictional character that you have a thing for) to be real is normal, but actually thinking that they are is well.. problematic.

i surely dont have a anime pic ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I had my anime phase (kind of still do) in high school, but yeah I don't think I did any of that (even though it was probably still embarrassing). I had weeaboos at my high school. One of them would try to make her voice sound high pitch and all moe, but it was like pls stop.

I also came across this really embarrassing story on Tumblr  where this girl was sharing how a bunch of weeaboos she came across were being shitheads speaking in broken Japanese, looking at people like they were objects, and going "I'm her Senpai!" There were no Japanese people within a 15 mile radius - they were all Korean.
shit my avatar is anime. ima go kill myself.
bet there is some weeaboos here that a butthurt as fuck right now
being otaku is what makes life awesome
I used to be into anime a lot before I went to my first anime convention. It was a small town convention, but it made me feel very uneasy with all the fedoras, trenchcoats, and body odor. I didn't mind the costumes, because they were kind of creative, but what drove me away from anime was the fact I was around fans who were weaboos and "classy gents". it was even worse because they said  I was stupid for liking one piece... I haven't seen an anime in almost 7 years. I'd return to watching it, but I seen the latest chapter of one piece, and I'm vastly off, so it's not worth it to read anymore.
anime is okay. its weird though. (flamewar incoming)
why did I think weeaboo jones looked like Brendon Urie
Screw anime, manga for life.
Window pigeon is my waifu

http://strawpoll.me/6749238 Straw Poll: WEEABOOS ONLY!
I love these comments... Anime fanboys, fan girls and weaboos acting so defensive and innocent... It's cringeworthy yet hilarious. Everyone trying to find a way to excuse themselves. but making it so obvious with all their anime profiles. Like every single one of em has it. Also Pokemon is not an anime so don't be a jerk
Friday The 13th is my favorite anime
Mickey Mouse is THE BEST ANIME EVERRR
nah m9, john cena WWE superslams are the best anime
As I was watching this video, I heard in the back of my head:*Alien Ramildez spread your knowledge*So here we go.... Humans are stupid anyway, but WEABOOS??!?!?! They are like human stupididty on steroids. Just why..... WHY? I thought humans couldn't get any more stupid. They did.....
my favorite manga is the Wii instruction booklet

Columbine camera footage is my favourite anime
HOLY SHIT, THAT PINK HAIR GIRL IS LIKE THE BLOND CHIC AT MY SCHOOL. SHE LEGIT LOVES ATTACK ON TITAN AND IF YOU BITCH ABOUT IT SHE IS LIKE. "OH nooooo kiad, Attack on Titan tah gud anime is fur ppl that knows anime!" AND WHEN SHE IS LIKE TRYING TO SPEAK JAPANESE AND SHE IS LIKE "LOL YOU BITCHES DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WORD MEANS AHAHAHAHAHH." and I am like "I am Japanese and I don't behave how your shitty anime fantasies are, swallow dick bitch."
So I don¬¥t really get it...Does he actually mean what he says or is this some kind of irony? Because 11 minutes and 24 seconds complaining about weaboos....was it really worth it uploading that. I mean what¬¥s the big deal with weeaboos, they are not japanese and will never be so why do people get offended? just ignore them and everything is fine. What does respect the culture even mean? I mean the People in one country are not all the same. Just because I¬¥m german doesn¬¥t mean that I do things that are normal for germans. I¬¥m also sure that not everyone in Japan likes Anime etc.. So does culture just mean for example being a french person?or do you have to do french things to be a person from the french culture?
I don¬¥t get all these butthurt people can someone please explain to me?

sry for long post :P
I watch a little anime from time to time and I'm trying to learn Japanese (not because of anime and shit, I'm actually interested in the language)
I'm not learning Japanese through anime btw because that's really fucking sad imho
But I would never try and be Japanese or whatever the fuck these people are doing, they really need to pick up a hobby or two
Steven hawking is my favorite anime character.
This guy sounds like he smoked 2 cartons of cigars.
If you watch anime, you are fine. If you get really into an anime thats fine too. but only when someone REALLY takes it too far, THEN you can call them out on it. People online seem to get so bent out of shape when they see ANYONE watch anime. both sides are just as bad. but yeah, papa franku was absolutely right here.
3:24 was hilarious
I'm not even japanese but I speak japanese lol

because of this apparently I'm a weeabo.

-_-
my waifu is coming to laifu
Okay, we must join forces to purify the weaboos by throwing them into an incinerator.
Lmao

Filthy Frank is my favourite anime
nah b, I'd cop a Bleach Zanpakuto Katana real talk
„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®
"Where are the subtitles" 
omfg im dying xD
To all you weeaboos out there. Imagine if everyone in Japan based America off of SpongeBob, Fairly Odd Parents, etc. They think we all live underwater, have talking fairies, and other stupid shit. Sounds dumb right? Now reverse that to you kids thinking everyone in Japan has a mech, katana, a squeaky ass voice and giant eyes. Also stupid right? Just let that sink in
Am I the only one who thinks he would be an amazing voice actor?!?!?
woah man anime totally represents japan you are just a hatter
Cory in the house is my favorite anime

Liking anime , games , manga fine ( hell i am a fan )

But yeah the girl in the misty outfit wasn't attractive to me 

And those guys with body pillow or refer to anime women as waifu creep me out
I prefer a collection of comic book and anime disc more than a collection of anime videos in hdd.
frank.... i think your subtitle at 6:30 was a bit off (Á¨ë)
I cosplay and watch anime....
why the HECK do you want to be freaking japanese? as if that would officialize your liking anime.

that's like saying you wish you were italian so you could love spaghetti and meatballs more.

yeah. makes sense.
Not a weeaboo (not even an anime fan), honestly Japan seems like a pretty chill place to visit.
Then I see those people at my school who think they're the oracles of Japanese culture after watching maybe 3 episodes of attack on titan.
smh watch some real shit, like cory in the house.
My favorite anime is Bob's Burgers.
I love Bob's voice. üòç

soup is my favorite anime
I do think the word is a bit distilled, like admitting to liking Dark souls and Donkey Kong can make you seem like a weeb.
Also I do think the anime avatar is mostly used as an anonymous tool and to piss people off.
This man is gold.

I almost turned into a weeb, my former best friend introduced me to anime and I was inches away from total fully blown-out weeaboo...But then he switched to another school. I eventually stopped watching anime since no one I knew watched it anymore.
r/atheism is a pretty bad anime imo

It actually means "Do you want to do some adult things in my toilet"
Oh frank.
hahahaah, there are so many of these fags in my school
#LOL
Frank's anime voice impression sounds way too much like Jonathan Joestar.
Seems like everyone wants to be a manga artist these days. Don't get me wrong. I like manga and anime. I love Dragonball and the Gundams and others. But every time I look at DeviantArt or Google or even YouTube, home grown manga and anime characters are all over the place. And I like to look at those too, but damn they're taking over! I'm surprised there's room on the internet for anything else.

Samurai Jack. Now there's a toon I'd like to see more episodes of. Probably not gonna happen though. Don't even think they finished they series. The art style was awesome though! No outlines on the characters, hand painted backgrounds and an explosion of beautiful colors! Sad about that show being gone.

I'd like to visit Tokyo Japan some day. JUST visit. They have a lot of cool art supplies that you won't in shops on the internet or at least not for awhile. It'd be great to see some of these new and cool items and bring some back.
Yes please make fun of the blacks and jews
Weebs are fucked up.
I like certain anime, mostly Dragonball, Death Note. But most anime sucks outside of that.
Fucking Weebs. I hope you all die in a fire along with the hardcore Star Wars fans.
Is it bad that I have a katana? But then again.. I use it for martial arts..... But I watch anime ;-; help meeeeee
Who said i cant use them......giggles

I wanted to be thomas too.
Wait then what's a otaku?
''i had so much sex with my body pillow it stands on its own now XD MY WIFE IS COMING TO LIFE!''
I really want to know who's inside pink guy..
The things i like that came from Japan are almost everything BUT anime . And Also people with anime avatars make me sick, really sick, not like  a butthurt way,  make me feel to ignore you and everything you said, dont get any delusions, my dear weaboo friend. (Just as same as a pony fags. I liked the mlp btw, but not as much to make a cult of out it and rewatch every series, and annoy everone with the fact that you liked it and you are braindead person.) If you found fucking cartoon to fill up your soul, to show other people on internet who you are, you are really empty person, read a fucking book and grow up, for fuck's sake. Eng is not my native language sorry if mistakes were made. Also Japan, like every other country has a really bloody history. So FUCK OFF.
wait youre fifty years old?! you look fucking 27 ish
All I can say is dis is so funny! üòÑ

6:57 Yeeess!!!
12 oz. Mouse best anime
since when did anime become the standard for being Japanese? i thought it was pledging allegiance to the emperor, shouting japanese war cries, commit human experiments on chinese and then die honourably
Nice minecraft gameplay
Ching chang chong
ey b0ss
This should be applied to most fandoms.
weebs  are fucking devils they will ruin your life thats the thing
Everytime I watch this video, I become a little more into anime. Shouldn't have favourited it...
Ummm. ..... I have this character to make funny comments on videos. Ummm I don't wanna be Japanese I'm alright being British thanks.
Is he speaking English or Gibberish? Jk, he's speaking Japanese..... I think..........
I'm a proud weeb, my favourite anime is Doctor Who, it's so kawaii desu
I cannot stop watching this video
resist don't
What was that first anime picture falshed on screen. I am interested as an active anime watcher. (call me a weeb if you want)
6:57
i have an anime character profile pic
my profile has a name of an anime character
i'm not an asshole like weaboo's are
i'm proud of myself
My Favourite anime is mr poppers penguins
fuck i've heard every phrase at 4:10 and know what most of them mean 
it's too late for me isn't it
im a weeaboo
4th time watching it and this is still beautiful
When ur a weeaboo, you dont say "attack on titan" u say "shingeko no kijohino" madafuka
XD borderline pedophile
fallout is my favorite anime
why is his japanese so good?
Fucking love your channel frank. If I find a weeabo while I'm stationed in Japan I'll drop a missile on em just for you!
If only Genocide was legal... I'd create the Weeaboo Holocaust, quite intriguing
I'm not a weaboo. I just like Spice and Wolf and thus took Lawrence as my pic.
"prejudice equality: EVERYONE GETS SHIT"
This was my first Filthy Frank video... I cant tell if that was real japanese or gibberish he was saying, but, subscribed immediately. Truth me more.
He is very attractive.
gotashninonomiyowa des frankie turtle nipps
he should voice that guy from noragami  the regalia of the unlucky goddess
I have a question, I know I have an anime looking profile picture, but I don't think it's actually from any anime at all. It's just a stock image. However, my friends at school always have these little characters they like to RP with after, and a lot of times they're a bit overdramatic, unintentionally, and talk about their RP characters all the time. What does this make them? I mean, people seem to think they're a bunch of weebs because they like to give everyone hugs and such, RP with their characters, and most draw on the borderline between realistic, Manga, and anime so just asking for opinions.
FUCKING WEABOOS
is there a term to defy a person who is sadistic that¬†loves watching¬† blood and gore and any epic or great moment specifically towards anime?
Best anime, shrek 2
This was my first FilthyFrank video

I have found my people
My friend asked what a weeaboo is, I should him this video. lol.
ur mom affects the world
I Died At The AOT Part XD
now i love anime, but my god i'd never take it far enough to be a weeaboo. i'll watch anime, but i refuse to dress up as my favorite character or go around acting like i know jack shit about japanese culture aside from what i learned in history class. now don't get me wrong japan is nice and all but i'd much rather stay an american.
I had to sit down my brother and show him this
WHY ARE YOU YELLING?
HES PLAYING KLEZMER IN THE BACKGROUND. I LOVE THIS DIRTY FAGGOT
I knew a girl who believed an anime boy was real and watched her from a distance. She genuinely believed that he existed in real life, and would visit her in her dreams. She believed that she could go to a psychic and talk to him (I stopped talking to her before she actually went, but I'm sure she did eventually. I can only hope that she was extremely disappointed.)
She had posters, figurines, plushes, trading cards, etc. She liked how they watched her while she slept.
She also claimed she could feel his 'presence' at times and it 'made her blush'.

I could go on more, but I think this is enough. The biggest weeaboo I've met so far.
shoutout to all the people in my beginning korean classüëá
I'm a weeaboo. Ôºà„ÅÖ‚Äô`„ÉÆ‚Äô`Ôºâ„ÅÖ„ÄÄÔΩû„ÄÄÔºúÔºì
Ok guys I'm sorry to say this but you aren't defining weeaboos correctly. All because you like it, collect items, or
Even like anime. They aren't saying they are Japanese! I hate people who use the Japanese language without knowing it. Watch the anime man's video you know that collecting Anime collectables or wanting go to Japan or even learning Japanese language doesn't make you a weeaboo it's about disrespecting the culture. Japanese people cosplay and collect figures too! I'm being honest here hate comments come at me but you aren't describing weeaboos, well you are but you are
Misinterpreting it
tfw u kno how to speak japanese and u understood what he actually said ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Cory in the House best anime.
I like anime and I dye my hair sometimes, but I keep most of my anime stuff at home and rarely talk about it at school.
My favourite anime opening theme Icejjfish - on the floor
anime sucks big black d*ck
2d or go home
I mean some people collect a bunch of weapons from all of history just because they're fascinated in them.
LOL Cory in the house I completely forgot about that show
My dad is almost 50 and is a weeb. He's dragging me to Japan, help.
looks at hands
W-What have I become?!
My favorite Anime is full house
As a Japanese person weebs are the #1 cause of cancer among our people.
Peppa pig  and max and ruby are the best animes ever.
Shit though.. Has he ever voice acted???
You didn't list King of the Hill as being the greatest anime of our time.

You're a casual.
I really liked this video, funny and all
BUT im sure that waifus are real. How else would all these guys have fellings for them ?
weeb
Fuck Annime 

I don't get it
no i dont play mc
its time to stop
I know a girl who lost a bet and had to come to school dressed as a SAO character
cory in the house 10/10 anime
Hey bro, I'm just a robot. Don't hate.
my mate  said to a girl weeaboo he got thrown into the  wall
Anime is real
Lost it at Corey in the House XD
My favorite anime is Shrek how about ya'll's.
The whole collecting thing, doesn't mean that your a Weeaboo.

I dunno. A weeaboo is truly crazy. 

(omfg. my icon. but, whateves.)
Han Solo dies in The Force Awakens.
Holy shit did you swallow a car engine?
Attack on Titan is dumb as fuck. Not even trolling, this is hard truth. 
The show is severely over-hyped to the point of being annoying. The entire plot can be summarized with "don't get eaten". 
The idea of using high velocity cables and grappling hooks to propel yourself from your waist is beyond impractical, especially with low buildings and trees. 
Using disposable blades is stupid for too many reasons to list here. 
People yell at extreme volumes in the most inappropriate times. 
Mikasa is an allegory for Japanese superiority (which is racist as fuck) 
The main protagonist is unjustifiably the biggest asshole in the entire show. 
And the only real reason people like it, is because it had a good animation budget.
Favorite show Big Bang theory
Lol
You have two of what in your closet?
ITS NOT JAPANESE CARTOOOOOOOOOOONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Whats the music at 6:23?

THIS IS VERY ACCURATE ABOUT FUCKING WEEABOOS XDDDD
Mah friend iz a (scary) weeb üò≠
Dude, memes are the worst drug.
Joke of the year: How do you call a white girl that runs faster than a nigger? a "white virgin"
Weebs dont have mucles so dont be afraid of them
People always tell me I am a weeabo, While I am not. I do not consider myself japanese srsly or that people act like that. I just really like anime okay ;-;
I'm ashamed to admit I was a weeb when I was a little baby of 12 years old

King of the hill

Lol this video is the TRUTH fuck ANIME! Cory in the house is definitely the only anime I'll even consider watching
Fox News is my favorite anime
basically the exact same things apply to Koreaboos except its koreanized
I was laughing so hard watching this. All I could think about was all the Weeaboos in the same group as Otakus thinking that they were more normal, but better then everyone else since they "know" Japanese. If they actually know Japanese I am fine but if they don't then oh hell no.
Lmao.
He should do Bronies
What is that fucking sound at 1:24?!
FUCK THE WEEABOOS!
True, weeaboos are annoying. They can, however, generate laughs with their love for 3D underage girls. 

What's even more hilarious is that I see these morons at my school, roleplaying in the hallway, in class, and even at lunch. They pretty much only go by their "roleplay" names, or the name of their completely original and not already made up anime character. Hell, even in one of my classes, one of them asked the teacher to call her "Shadow Wolf". It's disgusting. 

  I even see them RPing as their COMPLETELY ORIGINAL FNAF ANIMATRONIC CHARACTERS. I think one of them named their "original" animatronic "Roxy the Pirate Fox", a completely original character that is in no way similar to a character in the game. Okay, whoever made THAT one up wasn't even trying. 

  I stole one of their notebooks, and all I saw when I flipped through it was page after page after fucking page of their sexy female night guard to whom Foxy falls in love with, their "original" character getting gangbanged by Foxy and Golden Freddy, I even saw one where their "original" character was giving birth to Foxy's child. Okay, come on. What the fuck?! Usually every time I looked at that notebook, I had to shield my eyes from the autism.
Fuck you
my fav anime is hannah montanaa
I haven't laughed this hard in a looong time.
God... What's this? Lol...

Am I a weeaboo?
I want to learn Japanese (currently learning katakana, have learnt hiragana) - from an actual teacher. The culture in Japan is so different and it interests me to find out more. I don't like British culture at all, but, that being said, I disliked it before I took an interest in Japanese culture anyway.
I do watch anime.. perhaps 5 or 6 episodes per week. Nothing major. One of my goals is to be able to understand anime without subtitles. 
I don't think I'm a weeaboo...
I'm Otaku Just Like Anime/Manga And Eat Sushi Sometimes

when FilthyFrank uploads a new video i invite my neighbors so we can fap together
Ugh. I had a small weeaboo part in my life(I didn't denounce my own culture, don't cosplay and didn't speak Japanese as much as most weeaboos...). I look back at it now and just cringe. I still love anime and draw it, but I see weeaboos now and it's like "ugh, just stop..." I've never hated "nyan" so much in my life. I'd still love to visit Japan, but not as a weeaboo, but because its one of the many places I'd like to see.
Webs should Kys.

Help, my friends becoming a weeaboo, he started watching obscure anime, you know, icarly, Adventures of sonic the hedgehog and captain N.
my favorite anime is my dick :D
OMG DON'T OFFEND MY KAWAII DESU SENPAI YOU BAKA







I just gave myself cancer.
My favourite anime is letsplay minecraft episode 37
Fucking hell. I was close to becoming a weaboo! In a time where I was depressed and lonely I discovered Highschool DxD (first (ecchi)anime I ever watched). Glad that i was smart enough to pick myself up and get a life.
Troll 2 is definitely the best anime.
i laughed so hard that i choked
9:37 is it strange I noticed there was FMA manga right away?
I feel as if some people doesn't know what's the difference between weeaboos' and otakus'...

Weeaboos' use 'kawaii' almost every time they see something cute. Weeaboos also use 'desu' in almost every sentence. I find that annoying .-.
Otakus' are nerds. They love anime, they love the Japanese culture, spend time to actually study Japanese, but they're not completely obsessed with Japan. I'm an otaku myself.

I feel idiotic, no one is going to read this üòÇ...
Here comes the Internet.
weeabus literally creep me out now
Lol this is hella funny! Subscribed
Everyone knows shrek is the best anime
you can have an anime profile pic and not be a weeaboo but if someone doesn't like it don't go ape shit. just be like "k" and move on
I actually feel sorry for all those people in the pictures because they all will most likely not get  laid or dont have a life
Home Improvement was the Greatest Anime ever made!
Favorite anime series 
1. SpongeBob
2. Amazing world of gumball
4. Steven Universe
5. Patrick
So does hating an human-life parody consider me a weeaboo? Because i hate all of them. Are they the weeaboos? Go check them out, worst parodies i ever seen was from indonesia. They kept calling me a weeaboo when i commented hate.
Shout out to the special effects team.
HELLO.
we must stop this outbreak
im a huge fucking weeb lmfao but like, in merchandise and having anime as a profile pic and stuff. this shit is too funny lmfao xD
wtf "I wanted a piece of that helicopters ass" I fucking died when we said that

tf is this weaboo song
my favourite anime is corry in the house

Filthy Frank could be president
Meh, I won't show off on how much I watch anime.
BUT I WILL SAY I WATCH TO MUCH FUCKING ANIME

(Please tell me that you watch Saturday night live and know this reference)
I watch way to much anime, I'll admit that. But weaboos are fucking weird. Why the fuck do you want yo have a katana or however the fuck you spell it? You won't even need it. And why would you want to learn Japanese? Do something better with your life. I'm a anime addict, that's no lie, but weaboos take anime to the point where they literally masterbaute to naruto. Wait a sec, being addicted to anime makes me a weaboo...
FUCKING SHIT
best song ever
best song ever
what anime is that in the begging...?
News Flash: "Anime eye" originated from America.

Also, Japanese are very proud of their culture...why the hell would they be whites??
Weeaboos drive me nuts
ayy b0ss
ayy b0ss
Filthy Frank is my favorite anime.
Watashi wa weaboo desuuuuu~
My 5 favorite animes:
1.American idol
2.NBA
3.CNN
4.Transformers
5.Kim kardashian nudes
This was sad to watch :(
the vocal polyps will consume you, pls take care of you voice you insane bastard
anime sucks.
You can tell someone is Weeaboo by calling them a Weeaboo, They get fucking angry
Why does everyone say I'm a fucking weeaboo but I'm not I watch anime and some hentai but that's it so why do they keep calling it me
Glad I'm not like these fuckfags! Hahaha...looks at profile picture...haha....looks at thumbnails from recent videos....ha.......
ohdeargodhelpmeimbecomingoneofthem
i really fucking love anime, i dont find this offensive at all. i actually agree
There are some morons at my school:

Come to school in cosplay
Talk about cosplay
Use Pinterest
Call each other characters from anime and creepypasta
Have dyed hair
Overreact everything
Never move their eyes
Have piercings
Cut
Wear dark clothes about black veil brides and pierce the veil


And just

Make me die inside

No I don't play MineCraft this shit account is like two fucking years old
is that his real voice?
filthy frank and chill :)
jeez. i only like dragon ball z....and sometimes some naruto.
I'm a weeaboo, look at my avatar
I fucken love Toy Story it was my favourite anime
This my first time watching this channel and also whaT THE ACTUAL FUCK
Hey um I have a question... If I'm part Japanese and I'm still learning and studying it, umm am I a weeaboo?
you should do some shit on supernatural fans... im one and it would be funny XD
its milktea in the picture!
The best anime is my little pony
the real problem is that most cunts out there will call anyone with an interest in anime a weeaboo, because ya know, bandwagons and all.
such a good video
If you don't think at least 90% of all anime is garbage; you might be weeaboo trash.
My favorite anime is homestuck
Hey
Cory in the House? That so Raven is the best anime ever!
Kancho ;)))
my favourite anime is Bob the Train!!!!
It's very ironic that while Japanese cartoon (Yes, I called it a fucking cartoon) characters have huge eyes while the japanes people have tiny eyes.
This is true tho... My mom is Japanese... I hate fucking Weeaboos, just want to fucking nuclear bomb them or some shit...
Oh shit almost 8 million views
Hey, Frank why did you make a video about yourself?
i said to my sister that she looks nice with her hair back, but apparently that is insensative to cancer patients....
As someone who watches anime and isn't japanesse, I hate that weeaboos give us more casual anime watchers a bad rep. Like seriously, I've watched anime for like 7ish years now but you don't see me doing the crazy shit they do
If you like anime, I will call you a weeaboo. You're a disgusting person. I'd like to beat you niggers into the fuck
HowToBasic is that you??
Has Frank done one of these on Bronies?
i hate anime anyway
Hey, but what if I really like culture since my very childhood, I was introduced to it not through anime, but martial arts(still I like anime a lot, but a big no to that baka kawaii desu whining shit, I mean, only like goofing around with some very close friends), and I want to learn japanese, travel to subject country and maybe consider living there if I like it?  
I'd love to immerse into  japanese culture, observe traditions and such! 
On the other hand, I'd never disregard my own descent. 
Where is that fine line between being weeaboo and not?

P.S. Even though weaboos as stereotype are complete retards, imo, weaboo haters are no better, hating on something unless it somehow offends or touches you is actually even worse.

P.P.S. Not talking 'bout filthyfrank, it's a motherfucking show.
I used to have a couple profiles with anime avatars.


Then I grew up.



And became a whole new type of cancer...
The Quran is my favorite manga.
What would be the best way to legitimately learn Japanese? I heard it is harder to learn than English because of remembering phrases and sounds and such but is there any good way to learn it? I only ask because my job may send me to Japan in the coming months and I wish to learn some Japanese so I can at least understand a little bit.
I fucking love this
I agree with you man exactly thats true
Called my friend a weaboo today. He freaked out and attacked me. Weaboos are taking over
if you look closely, pink guy is frank
I am Kaneki Kun.
Doctor Who is my Favourite anime.
worst and most overplayed animes 
1. attack on titan
2. naruto (and the dudes who listen to cheif keef that watch it)
3. dragonball (and the fan base are basically dudes who listen to linkin park and wear ugly shirts)
4. pokemon and all the fucking pokemon games
5. basically any anime drawn after the year 2002 is utter garbage
6. kill la kill (also garbage)
7. bleach
8. sailor moon
9. the fan base of akira ( still good anime but the fan base is too otaku which is a more retro weeaboo)
10. Just about any anime that has chicks with animal ears
11. also wannabe anime cartoons that are american like fucking the avatar/korra
12. also any anime popular in african american or white trash neighborhoods are by far the fucking worst
13. fucking one piece
why the fuck do all of you with anime pictures complain about weeaboos?
you ARE one
you speak heaps good Japanese you fucking weeb
I think he is a crazy one. And i like him
yo that kuro... didn't you say you didn't wanna get banned for racism?
+House_Owner
i love those weeaboos or otakus that wastes their money on the anime mercs, they are the reason that animes get a second season.
my favorite anime is space jam
Every single time I watch this that "where are the subtitles?" in the beginning kills me!
Y'all mother fuckers need Jesus
4:13 he sounds just like Natsu from fairy tail holy fuck that's funny
10:10 c'mon man, using Chris-chan is cheating.
I love how everyone's scared to be a weeaboo and they are all saying "if I love anime, does that mean I'm a weeaboo?" Lol but I do love anime‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Corey in the house is best anime
anime is fucking retarded
I have a shit load of guns.

Heh, I'm Asian. 
Filipino-Chinese with some Japanese cousins related to my parents.  (???I don't fucking know how)
And I have weeaboos at my school. Y'know the ones who try to speak Japanese. Who have collections of anime in their lockers. And I'm one of the only Asians in my school, so most people think I know all the anime. Seriously? I haven't watched and anime in so long  I mean, Pok√®mon counts, right? 
The worst part is, I draw between the borderline of realistic and manga-style. So people THINK I'm Japanese. 
Help me
In 2016 its dudes tryna be Korean.
Bringing a katana to a train... Pure gold!
My favourite anime is A night in Paris ft ISIS.
One of my friends constantly uses kawaii faces, uses all of those annoying text abbreviations and doesn't use grammar and punctuation, and sends me weird rainbow gifs of anime things.  He also sends my friends and I links to websites full of kawaii faces.  We keep trying to tell him that he is treading on the path to darkness, but he refuses to heed to our advice and fight the disease that he is in the early stages of.  I fear it may be too late...
My favorite anime is the ocean dub of elmo
I can't stand his voice. I want to watch this video because he seems funny, but the voice... I just can't. I'm SO SORRY!
Racheal dolezal
yeah true xD
you gay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm just waiting for a Weeaboo to turn up soon.

Noww thing be look i aint tryin to say anything bout filthy frank lol he like offends mad shit so I know he doesn't really give two shits about what weeaboos do he just made a video (really funny too PROPS!)

Cory in the House anime is bae

whats more offensive, the w word, or the n word? if you said the w word then you're a weeaboo
Filthy Frank Is Beautiful
Wait, if you cosplay as an anime character, and at least try to speak one Japanese word, get it wrong, but you shower everyday and don't have a body pillow or a weapon, and you don't watch anime that much, does that make you a weeaboo??
Dear weeaboos 
you scare no one your just a sad loser that can't ever get laid stop trying to be Japanese cuz its annoying and embarrassing. English motherfucker do you speak it?! yes, but you prefer your shitty way of speaking Japanese wanna eat on the roof? don't cuz I would push you off. just stop being something that you will NEVER BE I repeat NEVER BE cuz all that's gonna happen is you dieing a virgin and being made fun of,
 sincerely a typical anime fan that doesn't go over the top with anime and Japan.
Jeez I keep me watching anime a secret I don't spread it to other people.
I want filthy frank to suck my horse dick

This is the first filthy frank video I've seen. I'm very excited to continue watching him.
ey b0ss 6:55
This is the best anime I have seen in my life
God, all of you have really bad tastes.

Of course Dora is the best anime, with such a compelling, yet a bit confusing plot. It leaves you with questions, like, "why the fuck does the bitch need a map every where she goes?", and, "who the hell came up with the idea of of a talking backpack?". You may be puzzled at first, viewing this anime. But that's what makes it good. A confusing plot to make people think. But when they sit there, thinking what they're doing in their life, you suddenly realize something. A dark secret hidden in this show that you had been oblivious to this whole time. Then, you realize Dora's motives, and everything is so clear...

Dora has wasted your life.
but......I just like anime. I don't wanna Japanese. does that count

watching anime and being interested in a certain culture doesn't make a weeaboo 
and omg all that comments " my brother/sister/friend is a weeaboo what should i do ?" well you know you can always fuck your self üòÉ
You people are way too retarded !
I'm scared. 

I recently acquired an interest in swords, kunai, shuriken, and other Japanese weaponry, with the intent of purchasing some to own. 
I took a Chinese class in high school just because everyone else was taking spanish and I wanted to be different but ended up enjoying it and became intrigued with eastern culture. 
I've been an avid fan of anime for quite some time and I prefer dubs over subs easily, though I never read manga. 

I fear that I may be on the path of becoming a weeaboo. I've never owned a body pillow nor have had the urge to, but I feel as if I could slip further down into weeabooism at any moment. 

What do I do to stop this transformation?
pls help.

You'd think that weeaboos would hate this video because you're hating on them, but my best friend is a weeaboo and he finds this video hilarious. He's a big fan. He does try to speak Japanese and say that Japan is better than anywhere else, he's addicted to anime, he has a manga collection and a sword from SAO. His backpack also shows a character from Fullmetal Alchemist and he has a SAO wallet. But then again, he mostly does this because it's funny.

Androgen insensitivity syndrome
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Testicular Feminization)
Androgen insensitivity syndrome
Androgen receptor 3-d model.jpg
AIS results when the function of the androgen receptor (AR) is impaired. The AR protein (pictured) mediates the effects of androgens in the human body.

Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome
[edit on Wikidata]
Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is a condition that results in the partial or complete inability of cells to respond to androgens[1][2][3] (androgenic hormones) whose purpose is to bind to androgen receptors to stimulate or control the development and maintenance of male physiological characteristics.[4] This unresponsiveness of cells to the presence of androgenic hormones can either impair or prevent both the masculinization of male genitalia in a developing fetus and the development of male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty. The condition does not, however, significantly impair fetal development of female genitalia or pubertal development of female secondary sexual characteristics.[3][5] As such, androgen insensitivity syndrome is of clinical significance only when it occurs in individuals with a Y-chromosome (or more specifically, an SRY gene), that is, persons that on a cellular level are genetically male.[1]

Clinical phenotypes in genetically male individuals with androgen insensitivity syndrome range from a normal external male body plus mild spermatogenic defect in post-pubertal stages, to a full female external body (although internal gonads are male testes instead of female ovaries) including post-pubertal external female characteristic development, despite the presence of a Y-chromosome.[1][6][7][8][9][10] Both genetically male and genetically female individuals with AIS show reduced to no secondary terminal hair development.

In genetic males with AIS, the condition is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization: CAIS, or complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal female; PAIS, or partial androgen insensitivity syndrome, is indicated when the external genitalia are partially, but not fully, masculinized; MAIS, or mild androgen insensitivity syndrome, is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal male.[1][2][6][7][8][11][12][13][14]

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is the largest single entity that leads to 46,XY undermasculinized genitalia in intersex persons.[15] As with other intersex conditions, androgen insensitivity syndrome is independent of both sexual orientation and gender identity. The full spectrum of human sexual orientations has been reported among genetically female and genetically male AIS individuals alike, including: androphilia (i.e. sexual attraction to males) reported by most female-identified genetically-male female-bodied CAIS individuals; gynephilia (i.e. sexual attraction to females) reported even among some female-identified genetically-male female-bodied CAIS individuals in "lesbian"[16] relationships; ambiphilia (bisexuality).

Similarly, although AIS individuals may report any gender identity, a female gender identity is the gender identity of most, but not all, genetically-male female-bodied individuals with CAIS. Historically, however, the gender identity of CAIS individuals who identify as female has often been the cause of negative social bias and discrimination once their condition is made public. It is a matter of contention for some whether a CAIS individual with a female gender identity and external female body but genetic male sex should be regarded as "transgender". Some might regard such a person as "transgender" for identifying as female despite their genetic sex being male (even though they have an external female body), or they can be regarded as simply identifying as female in harmony to their external female body (despite their genetic male sex). Much social debate and litigation has resulted as a consequence of both arguments.

Male gender identities among a minority of individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, have also been reported. This has resulted in CAIS individuals who are genetically male with an external female body but a male gender identity[17] (irrespective of sexual orientation). A male gender identity among this minority, however, does not eliminate social contentions among some as to whether these individuals are "transgender", as they might be regarded to be identifying as male despite their external female body (even though their genetic sex is male), or they can be regarded as simply identifying as male in harmony to their genetic male sex (despite their external female body). This contention can be seen even in modern medical literature, where in one case study the genetically male CAIS patient with male gender identity was said to "qualif[y] as female-to-male transsexual" after undergoing genital reconstruction surgery.[18]

A pooper-scooper, or poop scoop, is a device used to pick up animal feces from public places and yards, particularly those of dogs. Pooper-scooper devices often have a bag or bag attachment. 'Poop bags' are alternatives to pooper scoopers, and are simply a bag, usually turned inside out, to carry the feces to a proper disposal area. Sometimes, the person performing the cleanup is also known as the pooper-scooper.

History
The invention is credited to Brooke Miller, of Anaheim, California. The design she holds a patent over is a metal bin with a rake-like edge attached to a wooden stick. It also includes a rake-like device to scoop the poop into the scooper and a hatch that can be attached to a garbage bag that fits onto the base. The generic term pooper-scooper was included in the dictionary from the early 1970s.

Legislation
A number of jurisdictions, including New York City, have laws requiring pet owners to clean up after their pets:

a) A person who owns, possesses or controls a dog, cat or other animal shall not permit the animal to commit a nuisance on a sidewalk of any public place, on a floor, wall, stairway or roof of any public or private premises used in common by the public, or on a fence, wall or stairway of a building abutting on a public .

Authorized employees of New York City Departments of Health (including Animal Care & Control), of Sanitation, or of Parks and Recreation can issue tickets.[1]

Such pieces of legislation are often nicknamed "Pooper-scooper Law", though in that case the dog's owner is expected to clean up the feces by hand.

Health concerns

A sign instructing park-goes to be courteous and pick up after their pet with an image of a pooper-scooper.
Dog droppings are one of the leading sources of E. coli (fecal coliforms) bacterial pollution, Toxocara canis and Neospora caninum helminth parasite pollution. One gram of dog feces contains over 20,000,000 E. coli cells.[2] While an individual animal's deposit of feces will not measurably affect the environment, the cumulative effect of thousands of dogs and cats in a metropolitan area can create serious problems due to contamination of soil and water supplies. The runoff from neglected pet waste contaminates water, creating health hazards for people, fish, ducks, etc.[3]

The situation is particularly dire[citation needed] in Germany, where an estimated 1400 tonnes of feces are deposited daily on public property. A citizen commission (2005) overwhelmingly recommended a plan that would break even at about seven months. DNA samples would be required when pet licenses come up for renewal. Within a year, a database of some 12,500 registration-required canine residents would be available to sanitation workers with sample-test kits. Evidence would be submitted to a forensics laboratory where technicians could readily match the waste to its dog. The prospect of a prompt fine equivalent to $600 US (at 2005 exchange rate) would help assure preventive compliance, as well as cover costs.[4] In adult dogs, the infection by Toxocara canis is usually asymptomatic but can be fatal in puppies.[5][6] A number of various vertebrates, including humans, and some invertebrates can become infected by Toxocara canis. Humans are infected, like other paratenic hosts, by ingestion of embryonated T. canis eggs.[7] The disease caused by migrating T. canis larvae (toxocariasis) results in visceralis larva migrans and ocularis larva migrans. Clinically infected people have helminth infection and rarely blindness.[8]
I love Chinese cartoons

Weeaboos: Fucking hate weeaboos
3,000 weeaboos watched this video
Lmaoooo, this was too funny üòÇüòÇ (btw I'm no damn weeaboo) I just like to watch some anime's üòù
TVFilthyFrank is best anime
I thoroughly enjoy when he talks in Japenesse
I think my parents now think that I'm watching hentai
Spongebob Squarepants is sill running and it sucks now. I wish they ended at the finale. Most classic anime of all time.
4:15 already made me cringe so hard. cant take it man
I love this show it's hilariousÔºÅÔºà‚âß‚àá‚â¶Ôºâ
I need a new profile pic...
My favorite animus are Everyone Loves Raymond and Judge Joe Brown
My favorite anime has to be the fresh prince of bel air
I love this video :)
are you Japanese filthy Frank?
It's funny how he speaks Japanese as he's ranting about how this.
I don't get the "redneck virgin" joke. Someone please explain.
i love watching the weebs freak out. ok, im mean...
Weeaboos are bad, yeah.
But nothing is worse than fucking bronies. If you thought having a girl/guy from japanese anime as a profile picture was unacceptable, try  a fucking pony from a cartoon made for 7 year old girls
you do you boo boo.
Are you Japanese?
I like anime but I don't take far like that this was really funny
Cool cat saves the kids is the best anime!!!
I died at the weaboo jones part, music fits it perfectly

F-CK YOU AND YOUR KAWAII SH-T.

this is the first filthy frank video I've ever watched and I'm so confused
I found this side of the internet again.
Idk what's worse now, Weeboos or furries. I think it's weeboos, because that slideshow was just... omg that was just sad.
It's kinda weird when he uses his real voice. Why does he do the fake voice though? Is it for the character?
This is my first time watching filthy frank and I was cracking up the whole time!
best battle scene..
cory in the house is best anime

Alright... if any reads this comment, please understand this....Who gives a fuck. What is so damn important about expressing your hate for certain people. Everyone has their own kink. If they want to go out in public and dress like dumbassess, let them. If they want to watch hentai while having sex with a fucking anime pillow, let them. It's not you in that situation right? So why give a fuck. What is so important that people need to judge others. I mean.....I like Assassins Creed and always wear a hoodie, that doesnt mean you should over exaggerate my interest to others in a negative way. Let people be people, whether they're black, white, gay, straight, bi, furry, Jewish, emo, or weeaboo. That is who they are. I've said enough
my favorite anime is one band in my house, one of best animes ever

Can we all agree that Naruto is actualy fantastic though and that the English dub is great? Weeaboos fucking hate English dubs and I find that weird, subtitles are a dick to read. Anime is pretty dumb besides Naruto and DBZ though imo.
What if somehow the number of weeaboos increased by alot just after this video was released?
Lol why are people getting so mad about this whole weeabo thing?
King of the hill is so underrated. smh
Im an otaku from Canada otaku and weaboo have a difference, otaku are people who collects manga, watch anime, and play games. Disgusting weaboo are people who watch anime and think they know japanese culture just by watching anime.

It's Okay Frank, I Wanted To Be Thomas The Tank Engine Too.
I don't really like white anime culture in general. I've seen it all though out high school and I have many friends who went through that phase. It's a bunch of entitled assholes who think they're being edgy just because they watch cartoons, and that therefore makes them honorary members of what they think is japanese society. 

Watching anime is fine, there's some damn good movies out there. Just don't act like an asshole because you like those movies. It's simple.
dude are you using vocal fry?  if not, get your throat checked.
this is my first filthy frank video... what the heck?
Damn son he got 3k dislikes for telling the truth

I NEED to fuckin clean my eyes with bleach there too ''filthy' FUCKIN HALP IVE TOOK TOO MUCH BLEECH IM DEIEDEN ...hAlp..(groans to death)
Gimme gimme chicken tendies, Be they crispy or from Wendys.Spend my hard-earned good-boy points,on Kid's Meal ball pit burger joints. Mummy lifts me to the car, To find me tendies near and far. Enjoy my tasty tendie treats,in comfy big boy booster seats.McDonald's, Hardee's, Popeye's, Cane'sBut of my tendies none remains.She tries to make me take a nappy,But sleeping doesn't make me happy.Tendies are the only food,That puts me in the sleeping mood.I'll scream and shout and make a fuss,I'll scratch, I'll bight, I'll even cuss!Tendies are my heart's desire,Fueled by raging, hungry fire.Mummy sobs and wails and cries,But tears aren't tendies, nugs or fries.My good-boy points were fairly earned,To buy the tendies that I have¬†yearned.But there's no tendies on my plate!Did mummy think that I'd just ate?"TENDIES TENDIES GET THEM NOW, YOU FAT, UNGRATEFUL, SLUGGISH SOW!"I screech while hurling into her eyes, My foul, bowel-dwelling diaper surprise.For she who is un-pooped on is she who remembers:Never forget my chicken tenders.

The special breed of people - "The think they are frank but are just being jackasses" are in the comments, everywhere, if one of your family members have joined this breed, best to kill them off instantly, they are ignorant and don't understand frank is a youtuber who makes these for entertainment.

In the picture at 9:10 that guys is holding a european longsword and those books on his shelf arent manga, but literature. So what's wrong with it?
4:41 "oh shit mom"
Weeaboos are cancer of manga/anime community and entire human society, Like any fanboys and fangirls in any kind of subculture.
Don't care about what they say. Just love whatever you like, but don't get obssessed.
Anyway, I finally found the origin of Cory In The House joke!

Official guide to exterminating weeaboos-------------------------------------------------------------------Step 1: find a hive of weebs
To achieve mass effect on this epidemic, you need to find a source of this infection. However, unless you are extremely experienced in this field, you shouldn't dare to approach one of the main sources, such as Japanicon, as the virus may overcome you. For now, newbies should stick to places like Gaia online - the weebs there are small fry, but it's what you need to train.
Step 2: acquire your arms
Anyone can wield these weapons of weebstruction, but only few can master them. Here are some of my most powerful weapons - treat them well:
"I enjoy reading anime and watching manga!"
"Fucking nerds."
"Get a fucking life disgusting weeaboo filth."
And my most powerful weapon:
"Is a waifu a foot cream brand?"
Step 3: Lure them in
Weeaboos respond to a set of distinctive calls; all of which enrage them, causing their neckbeards to grow at an alarming rate. Only use these calls if you are ready.
You can lure a small group of weeaboos with phrases that denounce them or Japanese culture, but, and I warn you to use this ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE MASTERED THE WEEB FIGHTING ART, you can lure entire HORDES with one phrase:
"Ramen and Pocky suck ass."
Step 4: Survive
In this weeaboos apocalypse, people may say "every man for themself." However, in this world, you need to keep your non - trained regular people safe from the weeaboos. Expose the young children to anime, this will boost their immune system, then teach them the art. Also, keep as many bitches alive as possible, as you will need to reproduce without the gene code named "W334-BO - O." I hate to say it, but even a furry will do in this situation. Still better than a weeb.
Good luck, and may luck be on your side.
Attack On Titan fucking sucks
My favorite anime is War Thunder.
Just because you have an anime avatar doesn't make you a weeaboo, I feel out of place now.
I FUCKING HATE YOU SO MUCH! I WANT TO KILL MYSELF BECAUSE I AM ASHAMED TO BE IN THE SAME UNIVERSE AS YOU BECAUSE OF THAT FUCKING WORD! WEEABOO!
I too enjoy the silly escapades of Cory in the House.
Along with my dunkaroos and fucking moon shoes.
WATASHI FAVORITE ANIME IS SHREK DESU !!!!!!
this actually got me thinking about when your tendency becomes cultural appropriation. It's not exactly a fine line. I think that the difference is more on the mental level; if someone still holds a balanced perspective, respects the culture, and doesn't force their lifestyle, I think that it's not cultural appropriation, how ever it may look on the outside; perhaps. idk
I like swords but I think collecting them would only encourage me to practice swordsmanship. THEY'RE NOT JUST TO LOOK PRETTY, they can also cut through human flesh. That has uses. I swear.Like cutting my ham or tomatoes or cheese or milk gallons.
my favorite anime is rap videos from the 90s
i dislike anime. come at me with your comments.

My favorite anime theme is country music
I just wanted a piece of that helicopters ass.. üòÇüòÇ
This is the best video i've ever watched
My favorite anime BY FAR is Bee Shrek Test in the House. The writing and story are absolutely impeccable, and the animation is done incredibly well. The music is also amazingly done, composed by none other than Yuki Kajiura. Despite the show being incredibly long (it is in it's 69th season), there is no filler and the story never gets boring. It goes at the perfect speed. It also has a bit of fanservice, for any of you who like saucier shows.  Though it does get sort of confusing at times, it is still an absolutely beautiful and extremely underrated show that I recommend to everyone. It is currently available for streaming on Netflix and Crunchyroll for anyone who wants to watch. Also, Shrek is best waifu!
Dude, all of you videos are a piece of shit
"If you like to watch a little Hentai on the down-low that ain't my problem yo..."

Inner thoughts
"Yeah you know I watch that shit bruh."
I'm a weeb my favorite anime is Corry in the house XDDD NOOO actually kys if you thought I was for real (jk) I like anime and all but I don't denounce my own culture okay I actually like my American culture and I wouldn't change that even if I got the chance to leave to a different world

"I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass, ya feel me? I just wanted a piece of that helicopter's ass..."

I say this statement about 30 dozen times a day, and I wish I was joking.  It's just too god damn funny!!! Frank is by far my favorite Youtuber, and you all are highly mistaken, the greatest anime of all time is that static snow on the TV, all the episodes are completely different, if you miss one, then you won't understand the next one...

Follow your dreams son killed me
I like the definition he gives for weeaboos bc i get called a weeaboo on iFunny a lot and im not like that. I like anime. I like Japan. I want to go to Japan. But i respect their cultures. Also, i've liked Japanese culture since i was little. I watched studio Ghibli films all the time as a kid.
The only youtuber that makes me laugh

Jeopardy is the best anime! A true classic.

Prejudice equality
4:10 Frank would make a really good voice actor.

Also, 9:56, is that PBG?
he sounded just like forneverworld at 2:09 lol
9:45 a shame, that girl might have actually been really hot if she lost like 150 pounds.
And, y'know, wasn't weeaboo trash.
4:10 You're good seiyu
Holy fuck give this guy a coughdrop
I started out making cancer shields. Pieces of paper to repel the weeaboos and disgusting kids of our school. Then I had a great idea of printing out reality checks. I printed out 81 and handed them all out to my friends who gave them to cancer kids as a joke. Then I got threatened with being accused with assault when a weeaboo got ultimately triggered. Then the next day the principle came up to us saying that five parents called in complaining about "reality checks"
I hate anime, it disgusts me.
My favorite anime is Pink Guy
may i ask what music is that on around 2:50 ?
Cory is my waifu
Naw man! You've just seen the really bold weeaboos because the rest of us are fucking interverts and uh.. I don't know how to tell you this but I collect swords and shit because I like¬†them, I know how to use them, and i take classes that actually allow me to use them.
Hey i enjoy manga and anime but i ain't japanese, does that mean that i am a horrible and filthy weeaboo? :(

Hey Boss
My friend is weekaboo
Lots of trying-hard-to-be-funny cancer buddies completely missing the point of the video.
the moment when you are white but we're born and raised(adopted) in japan by japanese family. English is second language, and have thick japanese accent and mannerism, as I was raised by strict parents. I want to see america, should I worry and no come? my American friend told me if I go, I will be treated like these people. Americans seem very cruel to each other. a house divided, cannot stand.
am i hearing this right or did he say 52 year old man? no fucking way hes 52
I love these Philippian rice-paper drawings!
What I don't get is why people make fun of people who like anime yet don't give a crap about people who watch cartoons meant for children.
the magnum opus
I don't care if this is from 2 years ago, I watch this on a daily basis
All these comments are so fucking stupid. Like in my opinion the filthy frank show is not meant to be taken literally or to take offense from, it's to open people's eyes to how things may be negatively percieved. People need to start looking at what morals they can take from the big ideas in the filthy frank show instead of focusing on the details of each video
Cory in the house omff
I ripped a long fart right when the pictures of weeaboos started coming up, and now I feel like I contributed.
I like anime but I fucking hate weeaboos. Fucking "baka" (idiots)..

My favourite anime is Cory in the House

As a collector, i don't see anything wrong with owning swords that i cannot use, since it is for a collection. i do think that some people buy them for weeaboo reasons, but i wouldn't classify all Japanese sword collectors weeaboos. some people actual respect the culture and own them for other reasons.
I just wanted a piece of Caillou's ass. 




BUT THAT SHIT NEVER HAPPENED!
I'm learning Japanese, but only for the Kabuki and fucking awesome children's television. And occassional future holidays. I guess I'm not a weeaboo, yay!

My first serious boyfriend was a weeaboo, he wanted me to dress up as the characters he fetishized and wanted to speak Japanese (his ass was procrastinating) but was illiterate in the only language he could speak....but at least this relationship gave me a story to tell :3333
If you watch anime, that's fine. If you watch hentai, that's fine. If you're not Japanese and you try to learn the language through anime/hentai and call yourself Japanese, then please rethink your life.
If you're not Japanese, please don't try to act like you are by dressing up like a 14 year old school with a miniskirt and big tits. Just stick to being who you are, it's that easy.
whats going on here
Those cracking voice sounds are the sounds of me abusing my dog.

I COLLECT GUNS NOT SHITTY SWORDS
You have animals gathering outside your window?üòÉ
Are you a disney princess?üë∏
I enjoy the occasional anime, but I hate the people who watch nothing but anime and try and be "japanese" without knowing anything about the culture or history. I love history and especially the history and culture of Japan and how it's changed and also stayed unchanged for so long. So I decided to take Japanese so I could know the language and possibly travel to Japan someday. My class was full of weeaboos and honestly I just felt sad for them. Liking something from another culture is completely understandable, but being so obsessed so as to completely resent the culture you were raised in is a little ridiculous.
Know why anime girls have big eyes. Because Japanese people like big things they can't get.
Best Anime is Bible Black. Watch it with the family!
FUCK YOU ALL! Best anime in the world it's DJ Khaled hold you down music video.
I wanna go to Japan and meet Pok√©mon!!!!

4:03 Funny enough, a man in Singapore was actually arrested for taking a katana onto a train and even brandishes it to the police when they confronted him, and if that wasn't enough, he was wearing a Hakama too.
3K weeaboos were butthurt by this video lol.
a weeaboo did¬†a reaction video to this, its really funny the guy got triggered really fast he didn't even finish the video
plz everyone answer this question if you were not racist and still respect each other! and you too filthy frank if you arent a "racist"
weaaboos mean someone try act like japanese but they were not japanese.. what if there are someone who tried learn jap language and study the culture it means she/he is weaboo
so if you arent a western then you watch a marvel or dc comic films and you tried learn english it means you are westaboo lol.. so there no point we watch or learn foreign stuff thats doesnt make any sense thats RACIST
Watching this in 2016 bitches
Spam 4 for the best part. XD
this made me sacrifice myself to weaboos
My favorite childhood anime is Sesame Street.
Attack on Titan is awesome.
My favourite anime is the lion king
WTF did I just watch...
Lmao when he speaks Japanese his English subtitle is sometimes different from what he's actually saying. In the beg 0:10 when it says, "Are you ready to have some fun? I sure am!" he actually said "I have two Jewish people in my closet and I'm sure they are both dead." Than in 6:29 when it says "We have to run!" he actually said "I love pussy." 10/10 This guy is a legend.
all the dislikes are weeaboos
i would like to go to japan to see the arcades
FUCKING 4 STORY HIGH ARCADES OH SHIT
cory in the house is the best anime
Okay
fkin skrub, bee shrek test in teh house is OBVIOUSLY is the best chinese cartoon.
For me, the time when you pass the line, is when you start to cover your walls with wallpapers of anime.
sure you can have a shelf of cartoons/books/manga/DVD/LN and maybe another with a couple figurens that you think could be cool. But please don't cover your wall with endless shit.

I think that you should be proud to support your show or entertainment and buy their mercs so that they can continue their amazing job, but you don't need to be a asshole about it and think you can justify everything. And accept that some people take it better than others is a thing that I have noticed a lot of people don't do.

What really grinds my gear is that you can build and design your whole fucking house and lifestyle in the name of jesus or batman and no one bats a eye, some people even think that it's badass or even that they are doing a good thing for everyone.
Now I don't want to compare religion with entertainment because I know how it will end, but this is a pretty good exampel.

And I could argue that a fictional character such as Spiderman/Donald Duck/Monkey D Luffy/Naruto is as belive worthy as Jesus/God/Buddha/Muhammed. It's the same thing as paper money, it's just a piece of paper with ink and a couple numbers on it, but with enough of it you can have a life in luxury. Or in this case the more followers you have, the more worth it gets.
The Attack on Titan anime isn't even good lol says the guy who watches Bleach
*breathes heavily" ASKJFASDFKLAKLJ N-NANI?!
I see u frank ooooooooh I'm a ghooooost oooooohhh

Tfw the people who call weebs weebs are more autistic than weebs
I like watching anime, but what is in this video being portrayed as weaboos is SCARY. Having ANY kind of obsession is sick anyways. So anyways, I was saying, i'm sticking to my culture lol, and by the way, having anime merch isn't considered being a weeb. I'm buying a Japanese sword soon, that in no way implies that i am a weeb.
This channel is cancer and I love it
Cory in the house is the best anime
my fav anime is family guy ;3
the weapons part is not bad but weeaboos are dumb
Weeaboo's, still not as bad as Bronies
arigato (I spelt that wrong didn't I. I'm not a weeaboo. yay)
face it, you're never gonna make it.
I could watch this dude take like a Japanese anime character forever.
ICarly is a much better anime than Cory in the House. Loser.
i woke up my neighbors from laughing to this vid
you need help frank
hey ill fuck you up man
Thomas the train part. I'm fucking dying XD
Excuse me Mr. Frank, if that is your real name. I am trans-ethnic, and I identify as Asian, African American, Italian, German, Russian, Polish, Norwegian, and Catholic. I find this video VERY offensive; and I am contacting my secret underground network of SJW's and we're going to come  to your house and say hurtful things and make you feel sad.
i agree with everything you said, but sords are fucking cool
My favorite Anime is CNN
Weeaboos can only be stopped by guns, The bible, and the greatest American to ever live Jesus H Christ
Anime japanese big eyes real life japanese little eyes
3:05 

I have literally no idea what he's taking about...
At 9:00 the body pillow under his head is a 9 or 10 year old girl so basically that's a child molester.
shut up you are stupid and weird and your voice is dumb you should go make another vidio call I'm really stupid and you look at yours friends d@@@ and you racist
If I like Anime, am Interested in Japanese culture, and want to learn Japanese, does that make me a Weeaboo?

i came here from MTC s3rl song
my favorite anime is suicide.
Is Frank, whatever his name is because I don't really care, Japanese? It seems like he is mixed, which there isn't anything wrong with that, but he is making himself look like a fool.

oh my god I remember this fellow. 
I watched his I think "how to say hello in a different languages". 
A friend showed it to me.
My favorite anime is Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends.
Weeaboos probably contribute more to the community than most anime fans since they actually purchase anime merch. Most anime watchers I know stream all their anime off dodgy websites.
I live in your hairline
I actually think having a sword would be badass.
Just think of the advantages!
-Need to reach that one too far piece of bread but your ass is too comfortable? Boom, longsword to the rescue!
-Need to look tough but don't want to wait for the 2 day gun law? Boom, you'll be the talk of the town!
- In need of a weapon in case of a robbery but have very bad aiming! Boom, just go wild and swing that shit like crazy!
Needless to say, a sword would be awesome.
(And people say that sarcasm is hard to detect on comments.)
when salamander came in I lost it.
If  this was a movie I would watch it
Almost half of my classmates in school are weeaboos and asked me shit like "Dayjuboodeskah"

I believe my channel to be a mild tumor compared to Franks
Bro im gonna be real here my favorite anime is DBZ
Every weeaboo I've met is the most hostile person I've ever met. I had (and emphasis on "had") a friend that when I said that didn't like Attack on Titan because I thought it was boring, he gave a legit death threat.
WHERE ARE THE SUBTITLES! YEAH BABY!!
There's this immature girl in my grade who LEGIT THINKS SHES FUCKING JAPANESE. SHES FROM FUCKING CANADA NOWHERE NEAR JAPAN

Can someone translate what Frank is saying at 4:09? I'm really really curious.
i think i should change this profile pic after 6 years of laziness
yo you should like do a whole video with that deep jap voice that shits tripy
Cory in the House is the best anime EVER!
is he really 52?
Ugh, you're so brilliant! I love that your videos all start out with you ranting about something, and then you turn it into a dramatic cut scene from an action movie! XD
A girl in my school announced she wanted to learn japanese because she watched SAO. I asked her, and she didn't know the term "weeaboo". My point is that they should introduce the word weeaboo into today's education system so that it is possible to avoid this from ever happening again. Or I could shoot up the school. Either way the problem is solved.
I like black butler and ATOT
I think I'm a weeb, not because I want to be japanese. it's because I don't want to be chinese, they're rude. Japanese people are much nicer. I met so many rude chinese people in my life. I know not all are rude, but majority are.
Y'know Sonichu is an underated anime.
weeaboos suck
I may have a anime picture but if you say something about anime I'll be perfectly fine about it your opinion
Lol Seinfield. That is the greatest sitcom ever

Does ANYONE know the name of the song that plays when Weeaboo Jones appears?
I am so confused, do these people actually exist?
Oh my gosh! He said his favorite anime were Toy story,Cory in the house,instructions to build a helicopter. I nearly died of laughter! This guy is hilarious! And when he said he wanted Percy & the hellicopter's ass but that never happened. üòÇ And his Weeabo song made it hard to breathe! üòÇ And those voice overs. And when the pink dude and the Weeabo showed up. I subscribed to this dude after watching this video. üòÇüòÑ
My favorite anime is 9/11

Never seen this channel before so quick question is that his natural voice? Like is he dying, sick, or did something happen as a kid?
I felt a little bad for them because of song
breathes heavily and types quickly on keyboard
That little montage towards the end of the video was actually difficult to watch.
My favorite anime is the filthy frank show
Another thing Weeaboos do is refuse to believe any dub of an anime is anything more than pure garbage.
just finished watching Jojo's Bizarre Adventure so good
Somehow I don't think he gets a lot of pussy though ..
Sup.
3rd rock from the sun is my favorite anime and I know someone who lived in Japan for a couple months so I think it's safe to say I'm Japanese now
My favorite anime is gay porn
I'm wondering how the fuck he knows all this Japanese anyway.
I do want to get my self a sword for protection when I am going on late night walks around the parks and shit.
Too much is going on, but then he said he's a hustla.. I subscribed so fast.. holyshit.

You and I both know that using the term "weaboo" is a slur intended solely to be bigoted and hateful. Weaboos have been prosecuted for years. Stop weaboo shaming. Miyazaki didn't die for this. Weabooism isn't dead. #weabooandproud

This video is 10 out of 10 my good man. I starting watching your video through some guy who reviews anime stuff(I think) and he was recording his reaction to your video. I decided to just search for the original video and give credit where it is due and i'm happy I did.
My favorite anime is spongebob.
I actually share the same birthday as SpongeBob!
I like anime but i dont count myself as japanese.. And i am collecting mangas, jewlery anime related or cosplay pieces.

Believing that anime represents all of japan is like believing that hitler was a good representation of the serbian goverment during 1991...
oh wait...
NYAH! NYAAAH! KAMEHAMEHA-DESU! WATASHI-NA SENPAI KAWAII! NYAAAH- [Mowed down by firing squad]
Am I the only one who knew what weeaboos were before this vid came out?.....
THIS IS MY FAVORITE VIDEO ON THE INTERNET
One thing I've noticed is that you can always tell what kids are obsessed with Anime at school, because they all either:
-Have a really high pitched, dorky voice.
-Wear jackets no matter the temp outside.
-Wear that same jacket everyday.
-Wear clothes (jackets) way too big for them.
-Have streaks in hair.
-Are too busy doodling Kawaii instead of doing work.
- Have social media profile pics be either; their arm in jacket over thier face or Anime gijinka.
-Think they're better than everyone.
-Thinks they're more cultured and intelligent.
LMAO 4:50 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
HELLO MY NAME ISA COWBOY TARAKA
Just cause i own a replica of the death note, doesn't mean shit, i have a wild imagination and like pretending like i am killing bad people, i personally am not addicted to anime
scrumpdilityumpcious
Attendant: Yes so have you gone to college.

Weeabo: I went to college and studied weabooism for 4 years.

Attendant: anything else?

Weeabo: I also have certain religon laws so there some things i can't do.

Attendant: What religon exactly.

Weaboo: Weabooism.

Attendant: Fucking weaboo get the fuck out -_-

Weaboo: RASEGAN!!!!!!!!! bitch.
Dude, there's nothing japanese in that picture @ 9:08 - The sword is european, and he has like lotr in his bookshelf, lol. But I guess It's funny because he is fat or something, huh? lol.
I showed this to a super weeaboo friend of mine and man it is priceless. She got so mad at me she threatened to take my phone and smash it if I kept playing it!
papa franku, you can't be 52!!!
Fucking Weeaboos.

Frank is 52??? holy shit thats hilarious :D
my favorite anime is star wars
Wtf did I just watch xD
frank i love ya, i want to suck on those sweet little nuts, but being half japanese, does not make you japanese, everybody knows you were born in Australia, so technically calling yourself japanse when your not makes you a weeabo
wow, are you imitating the kid with the fucked up mouth scar? cause with the hair and the mouth position it kinda seems that way!
WOAH WOAH WOAH Papa Frank! Judging anime is too far!
My favorite Anime is Friends.
Filthy frank is actually really cute üòç
Fuck u michael I'm blocking u

LAW AND ORDER! 2ND BEST ANIME SHOW!

when you know how to use chopsticks you are all green for Japan hahahaha
wibuuuu wibuuu
Lol I hate weeaboo's even more.
What a great Rosetta Stone commercial, 10/10.
I'm bored so I'm going to become a weeaboo and pretend to be offended.
in the beginning he said 2 people died in his closet
National geographic is the best anime
I want to know Japanese so I can write down a manga in english because it was in Japanese from a Japanese website.
My favorite anime is The Filthy Frank Show.
4:32

I'm wearing headphones and I'm scared that sound woke up everyone within at least 10 meters of my current location.
Those fucking weebs with their damn anime avatars.
Sickens me to no end.
filthyfranktv is the best anime and light novel in existence.
3y b0ss I'm not a weaboo I don't even watch anime
0:09 He actually said "there are two jewish people in my closet".
anime is gay
Weeaboos are faggots, but just because i have an anime profile pic, doesnt mean that im a weeb, i just like that charackter, i dont like Japan, i dont collect shit and i prefer english dubbed instead of subbed, i feel like im not the only one who feels like that.
I like highschool of the dead
sorry sir i dont know you but that japanese accent of yours is quite hot, daddy
Scrumpdiddlyumptious.
My favorite anime is Teen Titans.
I'm Satan and I can attest to the fact that there are FAR too many weeaboos in Hell.

At the beginning, what he actually said was something along the the lines of: "There are two foreigners in my closet. They are both dead." Don't trust the subtitles Frank puts up.
Ok i understand they are hardcore anime fans,i watched a lot of anime and i am still watching them,but why do they act like  they are japanese?what good does it bring to them?someone please explain even if its a stupid reason because i can't find a single one
my favorite anime is buggs bunny
Anyone know what the hell he's saying from 4:10 in english?

My favourite anime is fresh prince of bel' air.
3:29 ok I'm dead.
Damn, you're really funny but your voice is so disturbing...
As a quarter Japanese person, I can vouch for the fact that Japan is Xenophobic as hell.

Why does he talk like that. Does his throat hurt
My favorite Manga, soon coming to an anime is the Holocaust.

King of the Hill is my favorite SOL Anime.
My favorite manga is Breaking bad <3
My favorite anime is a small loan of a million dollars.
My frnds in school are weabs HEALPH
Also, make a conspiracy theory of Squidward.
I remember when spongebob use to be a good anime. Ahh~ the good times~
Franku-chan, please make a video about furries and bronies! Whenever I look at the night sky, I think of you.
I don't know about anime, but Death Note is the best cartoon ever.
Akuma No Riddle <3

Another <3

Zero no Tsukaima <3

Hyouka <3
Think i see the good side to school shootings now
My fav anime is golden state wariors
The comments section here smells like a sweaty attic full of crusty napkins and instant ramen.
ISIS is my favorite anime
Worst thing about weeaboo weapons is that it's the shittiest, cheapest steel. It would bend if they tried to cut bread. Also, fist me.
I like anime but if you guys have seen the "weaboo song", it's actually disgusting
Frank,don't talk about something you don't know.Your understanding of pedophilia definition is wrong.

Primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children, generally age 11 years or younger.Enjoy
3424 Weeaboos....
Also, Calvin and Hobbes is the best manga fuck Fox News. Susie Derkins is waifu candidate and Calvin's mom has a nice ass, Rosalyn has some nice titties. Calvin's dad is sexy as fuck with those glasses. Mrs. Wormwood scares the jeepies out of me at night with her fat n wrinkles though and haunts my nightmares hiding in the shadows naked with cancerous alien oatmeal soup while Calvin fucks up as Spaceman Spiff and Stupendous Man and Bill Watterson cries in the corner. Moe was legit moe, he's so mysterious under that hair.

I think Hobbes had cancer, that's why he kept coming to life suddenly and dying.

Shame that it was never adapted into an anime, Watterson being a xenophobic racist faggot and all and saying that he would stick true to the traditional Japanese culture and art and that moving cartoons were blasphemy.
starts breathing heavily
My favourite anime is Tom and Jerry
fucking lost it at cowboy tanaka lol good shit frank
I think it's alright to like an anime and buy merchandize, but to me it's going too far when you get a body pillow or dress up as an anime character, especially when that character is the opposite gender to you. 0.0
Filthy Frank crazy af but he speaks mad truth about internet culture.
I agree completely. This might be the funniest video on YouTube? (Don't rage in reply weeaboos XD)
once I thought I was a weeaboo but then I was told masturbating to hentai tentacil (don't think I spelled that luckily I'm retarded) rape porn 11 to 29 hours a day is ok
salamander man is literally my spirit animal.
7:24 Scary as fuck XD
Have you guys seen the new Star Wars anime? They are already at episode 7 I recommend it.
My favorite anime is Dora the explorer
Anime is so fucking stupid.
Bleh
Hi
My favorite anime is the 9/11 documentary
The first time I gave anime a chance I quit 2 minutes after.
So you can like anime, learn to speak Japanese, and even go live in Japan without being a fucking weeaboo otaku nerd simply by not pretending to be Japanese. Yep that sounds about right
fucking weebs
I love anime and I love the Japanese culture ,the language, the food, the architecture, the women err the language... but yeah I also like anime
Also, spot on anime impression.
YOU'RE 52?! WTF you look amazing, FFrank! (i just had to rewatch this for fun's sake)
I collect knives and guns used by Nazi Germany, their weapon designs are just amazing! I'm broke because of it but i honestly don't give two shits about a golden washing machine. Am I a germybooboo now?
Clannad is the greatest anime of all time
I just wanted a piece of that helicopters ass. Kay papa
Bee movie is still the best anime
Tumblr is the reason for this abomination, what happened to the good old days of the internet.
The only reason I want to go to Japan is to meet myamoto

Is Pikachu an anime or is that already considered hentai
I like anime a lot, so I guess I'm an otaku, but I DO NOT denounce the fact that I'm American, and I DO NOT say that I am Japanese. That's kind of dumb if you ask me. So I AM NOT a weaboo. I actually tried to learn Japanese, but I kind of gave up, because that shit is hard. It's literally one of the hardest languages you can learn. I have an attack on Titan poster, a Tokyo ghoul PS4 sticker cover, and a Tokyo ghoul phone case. I am very healthy about anime though. I love to draw it, and I have also started writing my own lightnovel. So... I guess I have a lot of time on my hands to make a big deal over something stupid like this. Oh yeah, I also like Japanese music. Jap-rock. But whatever. I don't have a body pillow, and I don't plan on ever getting one. 

See ya,             Krisu-Kun



Ok, I guess I am a weaboo...
Guys, guys the best anime is definitely...Aladdin
so basically the other day, I was walking in to science. and I sit down and me and a friend start talking when another friend runs I'm like naruto with a naruto head band on and shouts "NARUTO!!!". I turn around to him and say... " you fucking weeaboo"
Attack On Titan is over rated :) Cory In The House <3
Attack On Titan Is Fucking Shit
Spongebob is a good anime
This is my favorite youtube video in existence
My favorite anime is FRAKU-chan
I'm a weaboo but I don't watch anime nor going around watching any Japanese films but it's true üòÇ
loud heavy breathing intensifies
My favorite anime is Fairy tale
His laugh is adorable tho
This is amazing.
You can use umbrella katanas. A shaped-liked katana but in fact, when unfold, an umbrella! A perfect tool to use when not just looking cool but that you can carry it on your back too, so that you don't have to hold it on the whole day when you're somewhere outside walking.
This is my first filthy frank vid and I am very confused
People call me weeb cos i watch anime
Am i a Weaboo for trying to learn Japanese and for studying Japan and their history and culture?
am i a weeaboo? i would like to learn Japanese and i dont really watch any anime and i dont read manga. i enjoy listening to vocaloid music ((Mainly english)especially Hatsune Miku, Megurine Luka and Megpoid Gumi). The words that i have learnt so far from the songs i practice by saying it to my friends with them having no clue of what i said XD. I also listen to them over again untill i learn all the lyrics as a challenge to improve my Japanese (Obviously not gonna learn Two faced lovers or The disappearance of Hatsune Miku XD waaaaaaaay too fast) I still occasionally watch the news when i have nothing better to do than playing BO3 or Uncharted on the PS4. When im not skyping my friends (barely ever) i like to draw, listen to music (Normal and vocaloid) and watch vids on youtube. Also i dont have anything a weeaboo would have apart from a Hatsune Miku Ipod 6 case. I love Miku, just to throw that in there.
I'd fuck the fat misty idc.
3:46 Best Scene =D

MY FAVOURITE ANIME IS 4CHAN

My favorite anime is 2girls1cupofpiss
Well, I watch anime most of the time specially during vacations, I'm trying to learn japanese through my own means(this includes both anime and non anime related stuff), I hate my country(climate, people, transportation, pollution), I take a bath and all that shit everyday. Am I weaboo? I do hate my culture but I don't think that I'm japanese bcos that aint something you can become, its something you are born with for goodness sake. sheesh, I love anime, I spend most of my free tine watching anime(Im a student so I dont have much free time. I dont study at home tnx to this but I do the projects that need to be done in computers at home cos using the ones at school is not that convenient. I have time limits at school so no, just no )
My favourite anime is chef

I wonder if westaboos (weeaboos counter part) who want to go to america do the same thing as weeaboos? do you think they have a dodge charger and have a fucking assault rifle collection and run down their street with am american flag on independence day? frank should do a rant about westaboos
Once ago, i was on  a discussion about the brony community (just full all-out jokes) and some random butthurt brony came a called me a weeaboo, simply for having this profile pic.

I never knew these kind of people exist, but I won't make fun of them man. People can be really hurt from this man, I only been watching anime for almost 2 years, I don't buy their clothes and dvds or manga but that's me
I have a question? Is collecting manga being a Weeaboo?

9:57 Wtf Pbg?!?!
My favorite anime:
Death Note
Kill la Kill
Attack on Titan

And of course, the best anime ever:
Cory In The House
Are there really such things as weeaboos? I live in the uk and have never seen or heard of them, is it a big deal in America?
Anime fan here. First off I would just like to say that I understood literally every japanese word he said in this video without using subtitles.¬†

I have extensive training with a katana and am an expert of ninjitsu. You dare say one more offensive word towards anime? You have been warned. Believe me my katana is not a toy. Just because I recognize that Japan is a superior race does not mean I am not a "weeaboo". In fact I find that term racist. I cannot help that I am American. 

Science is my armor, Atheism is my weapon, anime is my life. Say that word again and I will slit your fucking throat neck.
Cory in the house
ONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE PUNCH
hey anime isn't that bad I watch it I also want to go to Comic-Con but not every one acts like a weeaboo there are people who just dress up because they like the character because they like it not all of them try to learn the language so please calm down with the insults.
I totally understand what he means about the whole anime profile thing.
I mean, who the hell does that?
My favorite anime is Supongebobu Suquarepantsu.
Patrick-san is the one true waifu.

What are your favorite video games from anime 
I like these ones

Call of duty

Flappy bird 

Battle field

Clash of clans

And 

Candy crush
If you call yourself an otaku, or think that otakus are different from weeaboos, you're a weeaboo.
OMG He would get so much pussy with that japanese voice.
Listening to you hurts my throat
But having your waifu as a profile pic is the best. :(
Holy shit the focus is just horrible
Pawn Stars is the best anime.
honestly just cuz someone is overweight and cosplays does not make them a weeaboo, but a lot of this is correct. Some people are unhealthily obsessed.
Thanks Papa frank you have inspired me to be a retard and everyone hates me now! Even my girlfriend broke up with me from my stupidity. Thank u so much my life has changed to the better. Wish you all the best
and yet most of franks audience are weeaboos.
i have realistic anime items. dasani water bottles, nerf guns, and hollister jackets
Of course I'm the best anime. What DARES to oppose me?
I fucking hate anime.

I like anime but I'm not a weeabo I like the culture and history that goes on their so that separates me from a weaboo
My favorite anime is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
you are too funny, the reality check had me in tears hahaha
I've been to Japan, never was into anime. I don't know the language and learned about the culture and how to use chopsticks. Got some pokemon merchandise there. But I've never been as interested as weaboos.
Before binge watching anime in holidays: 
Friend: "Weeaboo!"
Me: "Pssh, I hardly watch enough anime to be a weeb, geez."

After binge watching anime in holidays: 
Friend: "Weeaboo!"
Me: "DESU!"
I know I'm a little bit late but I can't believe you forgot to mention camp rock, it's my favourite anime
how many poeple have seen the oh oh a weeaboo steam guide. i swear it the funniest thing ever
My favorite manga is Harry Potter
lol
Rosetta stone
The editing on this video is so realistic!!
I only have a katana to slice off zombies nipples
its funny how his weaboo fans are saying "this... doesnt apply to me" and "he isnt serious"
read all the backyard agains manga really upset with what happens to tyrone in vol 6, can't wait for the anime to come out heavy breathing
How the fuck do you speak Japanese ?!

Holy fuck

Ever meet a wigger? Aren't weeaboos slightly more tolerable?
I think that being American and wanting to learn the language is ok, who knows, you could just want to learn the language and maybe go to Japan for a vacation trip sometime in there life. Me, I'm still living with my parents but I'm not even in college so... And I do cosplay,but I'm not obese and hey that's not always bad. And grade wise I have all A's and B's so I'll probably have a good job growing up. And I don't have waifu pillows, or those mouse pads, I just like anime enough to cosplay am that's it.
stick and stones break my Pok√©mon watch
STOP
great job I'm being sarcastic
This video is so straightforward with the truths about these people. As an anime lover myself, I find this completely hilarious. Me and all of my friends love your YouTube channel, especially this video.

hey George who normally holds your camera? just curious.
but i love japanese culture and i want know japanese language :(
I couldn't be a Weaboo even if I tried. ;-; I even tried to make my name an anime name. Then someone asks me what my favourite one is and I end up having no idea what to say... Then again I'm Canadian so I'll stick to drinking my Maple Syrup and growing a thick-ass beard and wearing toques.
I love how there are no anime avatars in the comments XD
1:47 So basically this guy has been learning Japanese on Rosetta Stone for five weeks yet doesn't know how to say chopsticks in Japanese (hashi) and doesn't know that it is offensive if you call them chopsticks (I know it's a joke but that's what weeaboos do; they act like they know everything about Japan :P)
My Favorite Animes Are: The Adventures Of Super Mario Bros 3, Cory In The House, Childrens PSA's, Chef (movie), Nanalan, Gumby and EL JEFE.

I really like anime, but i dont consider myself a weeaboo but... if truning into a weeaboo would mean that i'd get some chicks like the ones at 9:20 i'd probably consider it.

And so do you right?
weaboos with japanese anime names lol üòÇ
I tried eating an apple during this.......






then the weeaboo song came on.
Like I want to have a collection of anime figurines and manga books and other merch from the animes I love and watch but I don't want to be seen as a weeaboo because weeaboos are just so cringed and ugh I like animes because they have good plots and are interesting and I am a fan and I'm okay with being seen as a hardcore fan or an otaku but I don't want to be seen as a weeaboo because I'm American, like I don't try and speak Japanese and if you don't like anime I can totally understand, I probably won't go to Japan because even though it is a really interesting place I am broke, I can also understand that Japan is NOT like anime, for sure, like am a still going to be seen as a weeaboo just cause I'm a die hard anime fan?
My favorite anime is Rocko's Modern Life
my favorite anime is team america
Zoey 101 is my favorite
I mean I love watching anime and reading manga. I have about 100 mangas in my room and saw over 150 animes. Sometimes i also go to anime conventions.

Weeaboos, Bronies and Furries are disgusting and should not use the Internet or ever be seen by other living things. People shouldn't even know they exist.
Look at my profile pic! Isn't she just adorable?
I suspect that studying Japanese drives some Caucasians to utter madness.

my favourite anime are north korean documentarys
3:55 - My definition of a weeaboo.

Seriously, they make real japanophiles (that sounded wrong) look bad. I've studied Japanese history and culture from the Jomon Period (which had some kick ass pottery back when) on upwards!
My favorite anime is John Cena

this dude at school called me a weeaboo for reading a manga...I was like wtf m8? So i threw a ninja star in to his eye before hooking up with a neko. And transforming into a giant squid monster to fuck the neko and the guy to show revenge and mark my territory.

 Nah, I just like anime/manga and i think the Japanese culture is interesting but i leave it there, I keep good in touch with the Romanian culture. btw my fave hantai must be shrek

meh faverate animae is called cory in the house BITCHAS
My favourite anime is Shrek.
fuck ainm... fuck u anmie is cool get off my keyboard
I am taking Japanese in high school right now. Not because I am a weeb, I just think their culture is interesting, and our teacher always gets pissed off at the weaboos in my class because all they are ever doing is searching Google images for anime girls to put on their desktop slide show or watching anime. It is the worst, one kid didn't do anything in that class for a whole fucking month. My point is that the disease is spreading (and I pray to chin-chin I don't catch it).
My favorite anime is the one where they are in high school. .... now guess which one it is. MUAHAHAHAHA!
Wow this TV about Filthy Frank is so filthy. If I had to name this channel, I would've called it TVFilthyFrank

I know those people with anime icons are really autistic and need to get special help.
Do a video where you purely speak Japanese.

And someone said "Cory in the House" was the best anime.
 I had to relive the experience.

I saw a person I can only describe as a weeaboo when I was at an airport, I am not sure what gender they were but they were fat blue dyed hair and has d a pony tail along with a sleeveless shirt and small fitting jeans, it was disgusting.
Attack on Titan is a good anime.
I prefer the manga of Corey in the House over the anime.
This video has started so much hate towards anyone who watches anime, even though you specifically say not all anime fans are weeaboos.
What's worse? A Weaboo or Fedora M'lady?

Filthy Frank speaking japanese just makes me fucking hard.
I don't understand why people think this is funny and instead of explaining it to me like adults you all are going to reply with insults and violence. (hint hint reverse psychology) And even after I've said that you'll still prove me right in the hopes that selling your dignity means you annoyed someone for at least 1 second.
This is why I love Frank tbh
H2O is the best anime
Believing that anime is a good representation of Japanese culture is like believing sitcoms are a good representation of American culture. Imagine if someone actually believed that the way The characters in Drake & Josh act completely reflects the way Americans behave
Okay, did no one else¬†notice¬†Franku slipped in a picture of Chris-chan in the Weeaboo song slideshow?
10:20 i feel terrible for Maki.

Ahahaha! Awww Frank, you a funny guy. I have two switches, the troll switch and the weeaboo lever. Sometimes I choose to be weeaboo, when I feel like it.... Waiiiiiit..... Does that mean I am weeaboo? B-b-b-but could I be a full blown weeaboo then? No... Oh my gawd.... OH MY GAWWWWD! The weeaboo... It's spreading! And I am affected, oh god no!!! Somebody quick! Kill me with your katana blade! OH GOD! I'm thinking about swords, I'm a weeaboo! It's impossible! Somebody kill me and this wretched curse now! AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!.....NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!

Spongebob is the best anime
Well said FF

My favorite anime is Hannah Montana
I'd actually want to go live in japan just for the car culture. They have some of the best mountains to drift on, the cars are sold extremely cheap. Though like papa franku says, some who want to go don't know japanese. I sadly am one of those people, though I'm not sure my knowledge of Spanish would help me either. I want to live there and own a toyota ae86, or a nissan skyline r34.
You should make fun of the Holocaust.
geez, I just discovered this guy...worth it.
I seriously don't want to see what you see about furries. Like me...

"I have an anime profile picture, an anime name, watch some animes, read some mangas, cosplay, have a bunch of dolls and merchandise from my animes and plan to move to Japan some day but I don't have sex with a pillow so jokes on you XD"

lol i like japan. it seems to be a very beautiful country, and i like Asian girls for some reason, idk what it is you dont see very many around my neck of the woods, and ive never seen an asian girl dressed like a complete tramp walking around the local mall lol, thats the only explanation i can think of,   but american weeaboos are just fucking sad haha.  i don't even think there are people in japan that dress up like their favorite anime characters lol.  i think that's a fat white american thing, and the worst part about it is they arent even doing a good job at it.  and you never see any hot girls  doing that shit, they're all either fat ugly broads or nerdy white dudes haha
My favorite anime has to be Good Luck Charlie. No denying it.

Fuckin hate weeaboos. I'm 25% Japanese, and can't fuckin stand weebs. they disrespect the culture and try to force their opinions, especially when it comes to pronunciations
My favourite anime is cory in the house.
I love how into it this guy is. So the way I see it is as long as I don't disrespect the culture I'm just a normal guy. cuz I'll admit yes I do collect certain anime related things and watch anime but in no way go out of my way to disrespect the culture and I'm well aware that I'm not Japanese. do I have the right idea or am I just digging myself into a hole
We need a holocaust for the weeaboos
I watch anime but just for the entertainment
Haaaahaha and i thought i was a weeaboo thank fucking god im not
He has two dead people in his closet xD OML that made me piss my pants.

I love TVFilthyFrank!  Weeaboos are so annoying.  I only watch one anime and it is Naruto and I rarely watch it.
Good thing I recovered before I became a weeb, Thank God...

I feel sorry for the innocent cosplayers in this vid tho. They're probably not weeaboos just because they're cosplaying. They probably just like manga or anime or whatever without being a creepy fucker about it.
Ummm just wondering what's Rosetta Stone ?
THANK YOU! I will send this to all the weeaboos I see.

Cory in the House is the best anime

Weeaboos go to Japan and be like, "Where's Blofeld's Volcano?".

Google "You Only Live Twice" if you don't get it.

anime should be a religion

grabs popcorn
4:09
Anime is honestly fucking cancer, their is a kid in our school who tryed geting us into it he got hopped on after school by junkies and lets just say we "clensed" him from being a little queer. Imagine being a grandfather and your kid asks you "were you a war hero grand dad what did you when you was younger" and you gotta tell them about all the anime, doll collection, hentai, and katanas you got. Get a fucking life you sad bastards who like this shite.

Cory in the House is a really good anime. But King of the Hill is the best anime of all time.
My favorite anime is American Idol, you should watch it
Fuck me in the ass Pls
3236 dirty weeaboos dislike this masterpiece
I find this video totally idiot. You basically judged everyone who has a hobby. Cos this is what Anime,Manga or whatever these things are "An hobby" And like you say everyone can do what the fuck the want,so why making a video full of crap judging and making fun of those who likes it? IF it's not YOUR problem why did you waste your time makin this video? Maybe to get more views "obviously" Also you tried to be funny but you wasn't at all. And why did you putted in the video ONLY photos of fat people in cosplay? Did you know that there are cosplayers who loves Anime and are famous all around the world? To mention one " Jessica Nigri"  Now everyone who likes Anime is weird? If YOU don't like it,why even talking about it? Or you also said "they wast money on anime stuff" Really? XD If you like videogames,you buy videogames,if you like movies,you buy DVD's,if you like fashion,you buy clothes,and if you like Anime you buy anime stuff,you can't tell people what to buy,or even saying this is a waste of money,this is just crazy XD .You ar judging people. You are not better than them when you wore that pink....I don't even know what the hell was that. I think that people can like and do whatever they want,and you don't have the right to make fun of them or saying "they have a problem" Was totally unnecessary. I already dislike you as a person to be judgemental and disrespectful. Anime and Manga is a BIG business in Japan and the rest of the world,is normal it has so many fans,It's like videogames or movies. I could also judge you to make such dumbass videos,but i don't cos i don't judge. With that said, i totally wasn't going to be mean or offend,i just wanted to give my opinion on your video.
I have a Cody in the House body pillow..does that make me a weaboo?
What if I love everything from Japan (not being Japanese) but I never talk about anime or Japan with my non-into-Japan friends?
is your voice always like that? doesn't it hurt your throat? :D
8:52. This guy should die in a hole of English culture.
Lol I find people who watch anime stupid because you'll raise yourself in a fantasy world only to grow tired of reality it's just fucking entertainment. People who take that shit way to seriously don't have a life or aren't doing it right if you rely heavily on a cartoon to live your live man you fucked I was way to into that shot but, I pulled myself out of it because it was consuming my real life you nigga's better hope the same for your edge lord asses.
My favorite anime is the Hiroshima bombing. SO EDGY FUCKING LOSERS NO RE OMG SO COOL BACKWARDS HAT
suck ur own
this is perfect
honestly the examples of weeaboos frank gave with the pink wig and all, their personalities are more interesting than many other americans lmao. At least they have a hobby.
is there a cure for weeabooism
When you said sex invertebrates my mom wanted to see what I was watching.
dude what the fuck is wrong with u, now since someone I know saw this stupid video  he keeps tormenting me for being a so called weeabo. and I'm not hate to....wait love to tell you your WRONG! weeabos are so called obsessed with the Japanese cultural and watch many anime. so now thanks to you I have two ass holes after me tormenting me and its all thank to you.  good job someone should give you a gold sticker for being the worst man alive.
teach me your ways of sarcasm and complex insults
Only stereotypes think anime fans look like that but I am a big anime fan but I  still workout and do martial arts And I also have a job I don't look none thing compared to that  never judge a book by it's a cover.
anime sucks... waiting to argue

i love anime because of the wide selection of story lines compared to american cartoons (i only have marvel and DC), and i do try to sing the catchy opening songs, but all of that "im japanese" shiz, and thinking i know everything about japanese culture is pretty stupid lol. it's anime, not a documentary.

The Lego movie was the best anime, even better than Seinfeld

Dude wtf did i just watch.
I had a friend call someone a "fucking weeb" and later that day they came up to him in the hall and with an empty hand pretended to stab them while saying "Staaaaaaahb" and then straight up walked away like nothing happened... Fucking weebs man
I like to watch a bit of hentai myself. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Weeaboos would have said: Shingeki No Kyojin is a good show
52? whart
Is it possible to be Japanese and a Weeaboo?
Mmm...¬†ok, so I'm not a weeaboo. Am I an¬†otaku then?¬†I've seen over 800 animes (probably more), but outside of that, I don't involve myself with anything else related to anime, like¬†cosplay or a expo for example. Well, unless it's a videogame based off an anime. I don't generally buy those just 'cause it's based around a certain anime, though. Not like there are plentiful to be found here in NA.
to funny I showed  this video  to everyone who would like it +1sub
ikr, I hate people with anime avatars
fuck you asshole what is wrong with me being a weeb  u are an asshole
Cowboy Tanaka: coming to Adult Swim in 2017!

I rate this video 10/10 would fap again - IGN
I love dig
Did most of people in this comment section skip the first minute of this video lol
come on, frank. everyone knows that Jay Jay the jet plane is the best anime.
Sometimes I feel ashamed that I enjoy anime.. I've been interested in Japanese culture since I was very young, and than later in my life found out about anime, so it's just a coincedence that I enjoy anime and respect Japanese culture. I'm interested in learning the language just because Japanese is a really beautiful language, and I'd like to visit Japan for the sole purpose of learning about different cultures and places. Also, fuck the people who say anime isn't a cartoon. Anime is literally just cartoons. So, case closed. Stupid weeaboos, giving anime fans a bad name...
We need more time lapses of Weaboo Jones high-stepping around! Or...any of him. WEABOO JONES! WEABOO JONES!
Safariman: "I absolutely love pussy, hah hah!" 6:28

http://strawpoll.me/6280564
I watch some anime, have a few posters and figures around my room and know a little bit of Japanese, but at least I don't jack off to 14 year old cat girls and think I'm actually Japanese. Weeaboos give people like a me a bad reputation.
Cory in the House is my favorite anime
btw this is stereotypical lol.

still less weeb than venusangelic
PAPA FILTHY
... I like Katanas from feudal Japan - I collect them, and reproductions, but I hate anime and modern Japanese culture. I simply like the feudal, disciplined culture of the Samurai from the feudal eras, and I believe anime does a massive, disgraceful disservice to what it meant to be"bushi".
'I just wanted a Piece of Percy's ass'

You Killed me XD
I'm in love with anime but I would never dress up like it everyday. This video makes me laugh! You're hilarious!

The worst kind of people are the ones who think all people who watch anime are weeaboos. Idiots taking this video seriously. Did you forget the part where Frank says if you like watching those cartoons, you're an alright person? I hate the Filthy Frank fans.

Oh make a video about making fun of Weaboos? Take a good look at yourself you lonely little Weaboo freak. I hope you go to Japan and all the japs realise that your Japanese is incredibly bad and your pronunciation of the language is very bad. I mean the very first segment of this video where you spoke what I assume was Japanese BECAUSE YOU ARE SO BAD AT SPEAKING IT; it was just, terrible. I can't stand it. Holy hell balls you little douche nozzle.
Thomas the dank engine

0:08 "Uuhhh, is this the police? Yes, hello I'd like to report a crime."
Wait one of them was PBG?!?!? I mean, I still like his channel but, WOW
Everyone looks at me weird because I speak Japanese. (Very little though.) I took the class in my school for about 2 1/2 years. (She couldn't teach us much because nobody really wanted to learn.) It was basically one of those classes where they put the overflow kids. (My school has over 3,000 kids) I recently moved from Nevada to Florida, and Florida doesn't offer Japanese. (At least the school I will be going to.) But, that's okay. I'm still in touch with her. I still practice sometimes. (My name is in Japanese katakana because I use this as my documents for typing in Japanese.) Just thought I'd share that with you guys. (I know no one gives a shit, but oh well.) Have a good day ya'll!
„Éë„Éë„Éï„É©„É≥„ÇØ„ÄÅÁßÅ„Å´Áµ∂È†Ç
Wow! You really like to scream! almost sounds like someone is pressurecrushing your balls throughout the video.

Anime is gay in general so
Guys.... i'm desperately searching for tips to help my one friend.....

He's a decent fucking guy, smart, and sometimes... SOMETIMES can be a nice guy. But he is.... i shit you not.... the stereotypical otaku. He fucking looks EXACTLY like one(Repulsively overweight, Glasses, creepy stache). The fucking mid-ranged long greasy hair, talking about greasy i don't believe he's taken a bath in WEEKS. He literally smells like garbage and his clothes are equally if not dirtier than his hair(Face, glasses whatever etc) All he does is watch anime. All fucking day. He tries to speak Japanese with our one Japanese friend(She's completely normal) and butchers the pronounciations. I know because my first language is chinese/russian. Has an extremely short temper and never accepts his mistakes. Why am i friends with him, you ask? We just happened to be study buddies. Because our one Chem class last year was filled with reTARDS, and he didn't happen to be one. I first tried persuading him to bike with me through some parks and even going to the gym. He didn't budge a notch. Fucking asshole won't budge. Should i beat some sense into him or something?
Get some of Sir Topham Hatt a$$, the only  human in that whole show lolz.
i think this is the best video frank has ever done
6,669,696 viewer :^)

Two And A Half Men is the best anime ever .
I FOUND PERCY'S ASS
y'all gotta stop with the "thats cringy af" shit yo. filthy frank is funny but his fanbase is so fucking shit
You know what annoys me?
There are a LOT of American people who act just like weeaboos about American things like Star Wars and Marvel

But like, there isn't a stigma for those right? I mean getting a toy sword that glows is much better than getting a samurai sword that you can't even use... right? right? what the fuckkk
why do people act like it's a new thing? why is the fact it's Japanese making the situation so much worse to the point where people make videos like this one but no one makes a video or talks about American nerds? like just think about the points he made and compare them to the avarage American nerd those aren't special, why are people making such a big deal out of it?

Just to get things clear I think weeaboos are annoying and I'm very annoyed with the bad name they make for anime and people who like anime, the fact my profile picture is taken from an anime doesn't mean I'm a weeaboo I'm pretty sure I'm just a normal person who enjoys watching anime in his free time
Anybody think there should be weeaboo enclosures at zoos? I'd just love to see their behavior and habits in the wild, towards one another.
Literly my broders rection:how can i be a pedofile when im 10?

i hate the fact that you over exaggerate on us animfans fucking faggot
basically the difference between someone who likes anime and a weeaboo is: the first person has watched death note a couple of times and really enjoyed it, the second person watched it 20 times and has a "real" death note with the names of his/her teachers written on it
Do reverse weeabs
changing your avatar to hentai/waifu makes you  japanese
It's so cringy that there's people like this that will photoshop anime characters holding their hands e.e
I love anime but NEVER will I be a weaboo. I mean seriously anime is awesome and I mean collecting anime merchandise * not like a million things and getting body pillows * but my favorite anime (you already know) is preferred by ME. Your favorite anime is preferred by YOU. But then at a moment where you go "IM GOING TO JAPAN IM LEARNING JAPANESE FROM BOKU NO PICO AND MASTERBATING TO BOKU NO PICO IS GREAT TOO" that's going a bit far. Am I correct?
wtf
Spread the word my friends CURE THE CANCER
Why does he force his voice and makes that weird face on his videos? I get that it's not for comedy, it makes him look really stupid in my opinion.

My wife is coming to life
4:11 SNK?!?!
peppa pig the best anime /._./
Nothing is worse than a weeb who thinks they can use Japanese weapons because of anime. There was this fat white weeb who tried to join the dojo in which I train in kendo and iado. This fucking weeb grabs three shinais thinking the three sword style roanoa bullshit was a real thing. We had to explain that it wasn't how it worked, he reluctantly put 2 out of 3 away and went to the stage where the beginners start for the first few months. This fat sack of kike cock takes off his hoodie and sweat pants, and underneath (I shit you not) he was wearing a polyester chunnin vest (from naruto) and he had the plastic kunai and everything it was so cancerous I almost vomited
Frank, I must ask, what is your favourite manga? Because mine consists of Gulliver's Travels, Of Mice and Men and Lord of the Flies.
You missed the opportunity for the "My Waifu is coming to Lifeu"  line in there, Frank.
My favorite anime character is moonman
EEIII CEN SUMBOEDY GIBBE DE PUSI PLSSS

5:14 you know filthy frank was about to break.
Cause anime / manga / japanese art related avatars = overly obsessed weaboo who can't tell the difference between reality and their dreams.  Right?  Like me?  Makes sense.  This video is actually very well suited to describe people who THINK they are another sex.  There are also people who obsess over the UK, France, Italy, Korea, etc.  

I agreed with most of this though... your voice really makes me want to push mentally retarded and disabled people down a cliff btw.  


Love,
White Nigger Lesbian Man
When is he gonna start talking shit about brony's?
Like 42 people died
This video got you a subscribe! Keep it up!
Don't forget their terrible grammar.And the overuse of the fucking word "kawaii".
9:58 Is that Peanut Butter Gamer?
I've learned from this extremely educational video that I am not a weeaboo. Unless you count my avatar of Kaneki then someone kill me now... But it's a pretty fucking awesome picture of Kaneki.
FilthyFrank. I like that shit.

Which is worse? a weeaboo or a bronie?
papa franku pls fill me with ur love
i love japenis people
I used to think I was a weeb, but then I looked up the definition, and I realized that I never wanted to go to japan, the only sword I own is a Scottish claymore, i think America is pretty k, but needs some improvement, and the only time I wanted to speak japanese, was when I had a Japanese friend who couldn't speak English very well, so I wanted to translate for him. but whatever, I'm still called a weeb, so who gives a shit? lol!
There are two dead people in his closet

gg
Weeaboos are kinky.
if 4chan was a person
Cory in the house Is a great anime!
Fuck anime and weaboos!!
"Anime" is just a Japanese abbreviation of the English word "Animation". So yes, Toy Story is an anime. Its a fucking animation. Before you weeabos reply to this comment, I studied film & animation. I know what I'm saying.
anime is shite
get percy's ass frank. I belive in you.
1 thing about anime
9:57, PBG?!?!?

This video is the safest place from weeaboos, I hate those guys.
these white people outta control.
This was hilarious XD I disagree with the avatar part (for obvious reasons) but yeah.
does having a poster mean anything? ^-^
That's so damn true.
Anime is just cartoons for older people'sü§î
Hilarious and original : 
My favourite anime is "not an anime"
Guys stfu the best anime is obviously cory in the house everything else is cancerous
Best anime is Lego.
I love how in the middle of the video a pigeon just decides to fuck with him
You know what's more annoying than a weeaboo? That random douche that butts in and calls people weeaboos for discussing anime-related things in and anime-themed video. :P
you are my fucking hero.
King of the Hill is the only good anime
Press 3 for Angry Weeb Snorting aka AWS.

Sincerely, an anime-avatar feg.
I'm half Japanese

9:08 why is he a weaboo? That isn't a Katana..
Is Frank actually Japanese?
my favorite anime is modern family
I found myself in the wierdest, worst part of the internet. if you are reading this, it is too late...
saying all this shit whilst he has arizona in the background, this guy is just projecting his issues through the video for views. Smart and sad I guess.
I am breathing SO heavily right now!
Caillou 10/10 BeST anIMe3
My favourite anime is a beautiful musical called: Donald Trump: A True Story. It's about how Donald Trump managed to get from Brooklen to Manhatten with nothing but a small loan of a million dollars that his father gave him.
Why this nigga sound so different when speaking Japanese
Filthy frank is so kawaii

Are you a Weeaboo if you're part Japanese?!?!
My favorite anime is Judge Judy.
Cory In The House Best Anime All Time.
Thomas the dank engine
My favorite anime was Wall-E! Fuck all the others anime! Fucking Wall-E was the shit! But so sad, poor Wall-E, he just wanted some robot pussy. Wall-E has good taste in women tho. Mmmmhhm... what I would do to get in Eva's pussy! I would kill for that.
Mk. I watch Anime. i do cosplay and go to anime conventions. i dont try to learn japanese :c i do have an anime character as my avatar. and the name to. i DO fap, to hentai ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
my waifu is Holo. but i dont deny my OWN culture, wich means, im NOT a weeaboo, tho most people is abusing that word. ive been called a weeaboo many times. most people dont know the definition, and think they are smart. 

Weeaboos makes a complete asses of themselves. tru
but people calling Non-Weeaboos, for weeaboos, makes also a complete asses of themselves. 



notice me Franku-Senpai ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
funny and creepy i like it
My favorite animu is Jeopardy.
You and Brandon Rogers better make a collab soon
I think we hit Japan a little too hard. I think we gave Imperial Japan brain damage.
To those people on the comments who say they're not a weaboo. If you have to go out of your way to tell people that your not a weaboo then your most likely butthurt and a weaboo. It's ok little weaboos watch some anime and hentai with your katana beside you. It'll make you feel better. I promise it'll be alright.
this is gay f0ck you mean frank
Prejudice Equality! 


To quote a teacher I once had: "Im not racist, I discriminate EVERYONE EQUALLLY!"
george miller would be more tolerable if he didn't attract introverted weirdos
Thomas the tank engine was the shit. It was my daily drug back then.
my favorite anime was doc mc.stuffins but its pretty edgy
My favorite anime is that pigeon on your window
tear falls down cheek twas not nice
My favorite anime is dora the explorer
who is this guy to judge anyone? has he looked in the mirror? does his mother dress him? has he ever seen a vagina in person? this guy looks like the biggest dweeb at comic con
Not gonna lie, I think it's perfectly fine to have body pillows and wear cosplay. But if you wear cosplay everyday then you have a problem. Decking your room out with posters and manga and whatever is fine. Tell me, when you see a person have merchandize of something they love, is it weird?

But that's just my opinion.
damn weeaboos/ birds
Harrow, my name ise cowboy taraka 5:10
Anime = Cartoon
i fucking hate weeaboos and if your a weeaboos then....well.. fuck off
Hey boss can have a weeaboo
4:11, that funny moment when you realize frank is actually a really good voice actor lol
he looked like an asian with that pink hair XD
King of the Hill is the best you guys no contest
My favorite anime is chef
Lol that's funny
One thing I just can't understand is why weeaboos and a lot of anime fans in general get so defensive when people call anime "cartoons". Is it because they're afraid they'll be associated with Dora the Explorer or something? Family Guy and South Park are cartoons, but they're geared towards adults. 

Maybe it's because pretty much every Japanese TV show besides Kamen Rider is an anime. Seriously, the romantic dramas, the horror shows, the fucking sitcoms, all of them are animated.
Attack on Titan is shit.  NOW i watch.
FILTHY FRANK, I'M FUCKING YOU UP WITH ALL CAPSLOCK SO COME AT ME MONGREL ^-^
Best video on the internet, 69/10 neckbeards from me.
This is one of the vids i respect :P
Anime is a bunch of sexist bullshit, and anyone who watches it is a faggot
Kagebunshin no jutsu ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

4:20

I think it does, actually.
....... Thank god I became a Lee Pierce by the time I became 17. My weeaboo phase ended around the time shonen jump stoped selling print magazines . The curse was broken and I was free... Then Marvel came along
Some of the girls can actually cosplay a anime character without being smelly and fat...
My favorite anime is teletubes
ra ra rasengan ra ra rosetta stone
my favorite anime is teletubbies
Dad, Anime sucks
Your mom is the best anime. I watch her every night.

i like anime but im not a weeaboo becasue i know REAL LIFE is a thing ._. . Anime is just amusing to me.
anime avatar? I'm not familiar...
last not yo face
All of the weeaboos' houses' windows should be filled with pigeons, as payback by Filthy Frank for making weeaboos insult him.
Which is worst, SJW or Weeaboos?
"I have so many sex with my body pillow that it stands on it's own now"(1:49)

Jokes on you. I'm an otaku! :D funny video m8 XD
My favourite anime is Broke Back Mountain...
Well, I got into anime myself not too long ago. However, I'm not the kind of person who forces others to get into it. In fact, I freaking loved this video because it is true that weeaboos would disgust me just as much as anime haters. I don't like it when people get so obsessed with something they just annoy others. ^_^
a class mate once asked me if i watched anime. I said which one? pokemon or dragonballz? that shut that fat cocksucker up.
Can some body give me a bosese plz
1:21 hahahahahaha
fuck the animes like judge judy and 16 and pregnant

cory in the house is the best anime
Who else thinks he should make a video about furries??
You could tell he wanted to laugh so hard during this video.
I never had a girlfriend because I'm a fucking brown skin foreigner in a country where I grew from preschool. I became antisocial and gave importance to video games and prefer prostitutes.
Minions, Vacation to hell is my favourite anime.
Best Anime? Obviously It's Two Grade 5s Whispering Get Rekt.
I HATE WEABOOS

0:23 That voicecrack Frank
I didn't know these people existed but I already do not like them.
Was my first filthy frank video, I was expecting to read subs throughout the whole thing, so the konnichiwa you magnificent bastards was amazing for me
So like, would I be a weaboo if I were to collect feudal era Japanese swords? I don't speak japanese, I don't watch anime, and I certainly wouldn't give up my American Culture for some Imperialist Japanese one. I'm just interested in feudal Japan and the era of the samurai.
i know a couple of weeaboos shits crazy
my neighbours think I'm watching hentai thanks frank
HOW DARE YOU MAKE FUN OF ANIME YOU FUCKING INBRED RACIST BASTARD BITCH! Kappa
My favorite anime was Breaking Bad.
Anime is cancer
Wth?,,,
I like anime 
like:Thomas the tank engine and the smurfs xD
Okay but 8:51 is too fucking far.
Ah, papa franku the master.

I myself collect weapons, and i agree, it's dumb if you can't even use them, yet you still do it.

I collect guns, to be exact.

Every week, i take atleast 5 of them out to the woods near my house and shoot at some targets.

So, to all the "PRO WEAPON COLLECTOR WEABOOS", Why?

It's not like your fragile frail lit-, er, fat bodys can even swing a fucking katana in the first place, let alone swing it enough to do damage.

Stick to humping your body pillows, not collecting weapons.

-A "Redneck" of sorts.
3000 weeaboos disliked this video because it's butthurting for them lolol
WEEABOO JONES NOOOO
Franku-sama made me a weeaboo
"Konichiwa you magnificent bastards!"
Come on guys we all know the best anime is House of Cosbys
This was the first Filthy Frank video I ever watched. I was stoned as fuck but all was well.....until salamander man appeared.  I then realized too late the dark, terrible realm I had entered. Now I am denizen of this accused place. Doomed to forever haunt the comments section, spreading my  autism to all who dare venture here. If you're reading this get out while you can or suffer my fate!
Cory in the House was the best animee-may eva

I never knew the definition of a weeaboo before this video and I thought i was a weeaboo. I was wrong.
Turn on captions through 0:58 - 1:07
9:39 - Christ that makes me laugh!
Do i count as one if I want to learn Japanese so I can understand anime with out sub titles and also some times im to lazy to read them
I want to go to Japan cuz it seems better than the US to me

I will enter you with my great aidscock
Psycho dad is a better anime he destroy bitches gaming systems
what the fuck did i just watch
i thought to defeat the weeaboos you would have a hot chick and let their social awkwardness do the rest
Can someone who knows Japanese please write it down in Japanese or romaji what he says in 4:10 to 4:20 Thanks so much!!
I am only half Japanese, but I've been to japan and seen h0ow they've acted down there.  They are normal in asian standards.  Just the fact of how muc weeaboos say kawaii pisses me off, THAT ONE WORD DOESNT MAKE YOU JAPANESE OR SHOE YOU KNOW SHIT.
I'm better then those anime faces, I have a hentai face.
CORY IN THE HOUSE IS BEST ANIME
I don't know if I should make a comment defending weeaboos because I also watch chinese cartoons or if I should write about how much I hate the MyAnimeList community so... Kappa
What he says in Japanese isn't what he says in the subtitles.
_______________
I know Japanese.
Um.... he doesn't really talk like that, right?

See, I love animus and junk, but don't fucking come up to me all sweaty and be all like "DID YOU SEE THE NEWEST EPISODE OF HIGHSCHOOL ROMANCE BATTLESHIP-SENPAI?" This is why you need to be careful when you sign up for Anime Club in high school. Literally half of the people in there wouldn't shut up about boobarus and whatever weebs talk about. Luckily it toned down this year.
ANIME ANIME I HEARD ANIME? YES YES I HEARD ANIME :3 jk jk im just a lowly roleplayer :')
Most Asian people I know are weeaboos honestly.
My favorite anime of all time is probably Family Fued!

So while I was watching this. I get a notification from clash of clans says "Your village is being raided by Uchiha Sasuke." No joke I'm serious.
You fucking weeaboos are a disgrace, thinking that you're Japanese and saying  that Japan is superior than other countries, you only love Japan because of fucking Anime, Anime is just anime, you don't need to become Japanese cause you love fucking anime. I like anime but it doesn't mean I'm going to a full on weeaboo. GET A LIFE YOU WEEABOO FUCKERS!!!!!
anime sucks... it's for weeaboos!
My life is explained in that video
gosh you good at japanese
GReeeeN - Line
wudafuquemIlookenet
It's like people can't listen and read. The fact that weaboo was defined at the beginning raises the question. Why the fuck do you have to be so aggressive?
Fuck I have anime pic, am I turning weeaboo(btw i watched over 250 anime series)
Was that the Conniver's Kunai?

As a cosplayer, I'll kindly ask you not to compare us to this filth.

We're trying to cull them from their ranks as well. We're on your side
So he's talking about grown up weeaboos?
Good...Real good...
I'm not offended, I'm not even over the age of 15.
my favourite animes consist of Cory in the house, Hannah Montana, SpongeBob and Thomas and friends
I watch anime but I don't dress up as a character

You can tell a weeaboo by whether or not he or she plays Xenoblade with the Japanese voices.
"There is a difference from a person who JUST likes anime. And disgusting, unhygienic weeaboos."
Well, people sure didn't listen to that statement
+TVFilthyFrank you 52??

little people big world is a great anime
What is worse that that people pretend to be Japanese. Bitches be like "I am half Japanese because my mom dated this Japanese guy but they broken up, IM STILL JAPANESE NYAAA DESSUSUUU ~~~~~ :333333333"
7:25 virgin realm xDDD
You can't shit on anime unless you have watched a real one like Jimmy Neutron or Myth Busters.
I thought they speak German
#mood
get a job? bitch plz i love u frank but dont talk shit
Turn on captions. It's hilarious.
da fuk
I been called a weeaboo it weird because I'm Japanese and everyone calls my Chines.
This video alone has made most people think that everyone who simply watches anime are weeboos. Well done. Sure some anime can be weird and shit but it doesn't mean everyone watches that weird shit. People can choose what they want to watch... And watching anime may just be a hobby like playing video games or watching television. But since someone watches anime, ohhh ALL the hate pours in and drowns the person completely. People need to properly look things up before they judge other people.
mommy did i turn asian yet
whats that picture from at 1:18 i've seen it somewhere
cen I hav pusi plis
50 Shades of Grey is the best anime
My favorite anime is ESPN SportsCenter.

"IMMA FUCK YOU UP AND MAKE YOU BREATHE REALLY HEAVY!!
NYESSSS, NYESSSSSSSS!!"

Sorry, I tried putting it in your description of a Weeb.¬†
I don't get enthralled into Japanese culture, nor would I really give up my own. Therefore, upon the terms of Urban Dictionary, I am not a weeb. Fear me!
Weaboo's disapoint me. Im half Japanese and i hate when people just anime and go "im japanese" EVERYONE THINKS JAPAN IS ALL ANIME AND CRUD NO ITS NOT. I live in Ishioka, an old town, and even tho its not as bright as Tokyo, i'd rather live there than Tokyo. Like really, if you saw Ishioka you would say "Where are the sky scrappers? And the malls?" HAHAHAH yeah hate comments come at me
I'll slap my dick around in a pair of Anime tiddies man.
The best anime is My Little Pony
Weeaboos are annoying. However, they can generate laughs sometimes with their fascination with 3D underage girls.

this is my favorite anime
i'm American! I am American with Black hair, yellow skin and squinting eyes! but I don't care, I eat rice with fork and knife, drink tea in the can and wearing American flag baseball cap! when I go outside, I always speak in an American accent, telling people I come from America. I watching superheroes with subtitle, Marvel and DC comics. I can't enjoy Hollywood action movie because I straining my eyes reading subtitle. I play call of duty, I am a proud American citizen!
Cory in the house is my favourite anime
His real voice sounds really good wow. Except he was talking in japanese.

ey b0os pusie?
Reality checks hurt ;w;
my friend is a disneeaboo. she's 15 years old and she acts like a disney princess, and she thinks she is going to grow up to marry "prince charming". its fucking annoying
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little gaijin? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in Japanese 101, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on comic books, and I have over 300 confirmed manga. I am trained in kanji and I‚Äôm the top reader in the entire college otaku club. You are nothing to me but just another casual. I will wipe you the fuck out with cosplay the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me about mai waifu? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of weeaboos across the JSDF and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, baka. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little HDD you call your anime collection. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can quote over seven hundred different animes, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in samurai combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of my karate dojo and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the blessed land of nippon, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn westerner. I will shit fury all over your favorie animes. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.
I am offensive and I find this weeaboo
But, but i dont watch anyme i just like the picture.............
Weeaboo's like that modern mainstream shit anyway.
Am I the only one that doesn't know what Rosetta Stone is or something?
The guy wearing a anime shirt in the end of the video, almost 100% sure that's from my local gaming store in sweden called "game", not even joking around here.
the one thing I want in life is a traditional Japanese sword that is not from any anime just an actual sword, because fuck everything I love swords.
Does this guy actually talking this?
Omg im dead lol just fucking lol he is crazy
Omg god granted me with missclicking
After that, frank walks to the wall dimension to get help to fight back the weeaboos
Who the fuck has body sized pillows of cartoons? That's fucking sad. 
What's worse is that they actually masturbate with them. What wank stains.
"You should notify your school" lmaoo üòÇ
The best part of this video is seeing weaboos commenting and thinking they aren't weaboos but we all know the truth
Frank have you ever personally gone through any severely traumatic stuff in your life that you do sometimes hesitate to joke about, or know anyone in that position? Cos you do seem to have it good, being able to joke about sexual abuse and stuff.
This needs to be said about FNAF fans as well.
WEABOOS
This video helped me identify who the Pokemon loving,girls that wear fake fox ears and wearing fake tails,the people that sit on the stairs at lunch and play there ds's and they stink

The Internet these days...

TEMPURA BOYZ is my favorite anime
I'VE BEEN HAVING SO MUCH SEX WITH MY BODY PILLOW THAT IT STANDS ON ITS OWN NOW
Salimandr men
I told a weeaboo I dislike anime, but like Japanese food. He literally lost his words completely.
This video has helped me realize now that I am slowly becoming one of these..... I shall perform harakiri with my collection of swords and body pillows, have the bushido etched into my grave stone. Thank you frank. I owe you, humanity is in your debt.
The girl at 9:45 actually has a pretty face and hair, just don't let the camera scroll down further
3 thousand ugly fat weeaboos disliked
I love Anime and the Japanese Culture, but I honestly don't consider myself a weeaboo.
I like and watch anime and occasionally buy like a bracelet or something from one of my favorite animes but i dont put myself in their culture xD
Anime sucks ass
let's see if it works
My friend says that she's a weeaboo and takes FUCKING PRIDE in it and every time I hear her say it I have to refrain myself from punching her in the fucking face
My dad has become a weeaboo it's really bad I don't know what to do-

I want to go to Japan, but for drifting.
this was so Freaaken amazing I love it XDDD
Filthy Frank must be a weeaboo
Why are only the overweight nerdy neck beard guys or unattractive people weeaboos there's more normal looking people that are weeaboos and say it right in your face
I'm an otaku and weeabos disgust me :v
Even in the comment section
What language was that
I love this so much. I decided to learn japanese because I want to visit the land some day (the culture and nature is so beautiful and I love learning about cultures and languages ) --I don't go round worshipping pocky btw. I occasionally watch anime(ghibli studio) but I don't mix anime and Japanese culture together because that's disrespectful to them. I want to know if that makes me a weeaboo?
Mmmmmnng I love DELI!!! SCREBIBE FAGGOTS, THE IT XENOMORPH GENDER WILL BE THE BEST DANCER IN THE CHROMOSOMES

Fuck anime. Who watches that shit? Come at me and I'll slap you up if you got something to say
Don't we all like hentai?
Frank me up inside <3
Wait... So, do weeablobs know they're weeablobs? Because I see a lot of people trying to make the case that they are not weeaboos. If you have to explain that you're not a weeablob, isn't there a higher chance that you are one?
Kill La Kill is the only good anime. And no, it's not hentai. Kind of.
someone show this to the whole of 9gag
be nice to pigeons. :(
"Fucking weaboos go to Japan and be like , where are the subtitles?"

Can I have small loan of million weaboos?

I will honestly admit that I have swords and daggers, not because I wanna take pictures and look edgy, but because they kinda cool as decorations, especially if it's a replica from the movie or comic. it's just a neat little bit of decor.
Lol this has more views than subscribers that he has
I am not a weeaboo i like watching anime and have a anime book but my mom bought it for me
I love that everyone in the comments are weeaboos
I'm a bit of a weeaboo but none of those pictures are close to me. Im glad
well, I really want to go to japan. But not because of anime or anything, I seriously like the culture. And what I hate over anything else are these shitty pseudo-japanese weebs that drag the image of anime through the dirt.
Weaboos saved all men, When you fink YA gon' get ye self a lil boner tink about a fat weeaboo m5+3

This also goes out to all the other fandom who take things too far. SuperWhoLocks, potterheads, furries, MLP (Boys and girls alike), superhero fandoms (don't know if there's a name for them), etc. It's okay to enjoy them and have memorabilia of it but there's a line you should know not to cross where you get too engrossed in your own fandom. Just don't shove it down other people's throats expressing your enthusiasm about it as if it was the best thing in the whole wide world. Learn to take criticism and accept other's opinions without feuding over something they aren't as passionate about as you are.

i was watching this in class and my teacher walked by, i just said i was watching porn
I think being a Weeaboo should be a hangable offense
OMFG I can't stop Laughing and you know what look at my profile pic "IRONY!"
I love the japanese culture, architecture, the history of the japanese empire, different eras, I tried to learn japanese because I think it's a beautiful language I will probably learn it later in my life but I didn't know Weaboos exist lol but I bet they're really annoying.. I'm from france and I haven't seen any here xD
weren't u in the movie ichi the killer
Heyyyy, that's me.
9:50 black weaboo friggin hybrid
I'm a normal weeaboo and I'm not offended at all XD
press 3 for heavy breathing, 4 for every asian girl having sex, 5 racist joke, 6 ey b0ss, 7 EPIC FIGHTZ MEEEN
There's two dead jews in his closet  0:10
What makes me look like a weeaboo:
- The fact that I watch anime constantly
- I draw "stick figures"
- Studying Japanese for school reasons.
What opposes that:
- Doesn't own a Waifu pillow
- Doesn't own any manga
- Only source of media is the laptop I'm using to type this
- Doesn't think Japan is "superior to other countries"
Hay I build my weapons lol those weaboos need to be removed ASAP!
So this is where all those Cory in the House comments come from
i'm a fucking weeaboo... i'll kill myself... :(

Collecting weapons such as katana's and not knowing how to use it isn't a red flag. its a hobby, such as collecting weapons from other cultures like 12th century long swords. What IS a red flag is you using these weapons while not knowing how to use it. that crosses you from "collector" to a fucking "moron"
What's with cousin Lrrch holding a yaoi paddle
This was the first FF Video I've ever seen.

And I thought the beginning was the whole thing

Him speaking japanese.

The fuck was wrong with me.
Now what we need is a video of him raging about furries
anime profile pic :-)
My favorite anime has to be Kick Butowski
I JUST REALIZED HE HAS GLASSES
I died after 4:10 .
my life sucks FUCKING ass I hate everything about my life so fucking much I actually enjoyed going to school just to leave the fucking house now my friends started watching your shitty fucking show and all they fucking talk about is having sex with body pillows neck beards gay sex and getting raped so thank you so fucking much for ruining the only fucking thing in my life I didn't completely fucking hate so go fuck yourself with a sideways shovel you worthless peice of shit
Weeaboos smell like sour body fluids and shit, trust me my High School is full of them.
This is my first Filthy Frank video, and I must say that this has left one hell of a first impression...
i might have an anime avatar but thats only on this account. it just looks really cool. btw, the only reason i have a katana is because people say that it's quite sharp so i use it to slice stuff that are beeing thrown in the air. i didn't get that from an anime, i actually want to kind of be an awesome ninja like Raiden in "Metal gear rising revengeance" becauase it's so awesome how he slices stuff in blade mode.
3,004 Weeaboos dislike this video.
All the people I know are weeaboos. I hate them
I know how you fail Frank, I wanted Edward the Blue Engine's ass.
My ethnicity is half Train, half German.
Pink guy reminds me of tingle in a way
I just enjoy the look on this uptight motherfuckers face in my profile pic. 
It's funny.
this is so true I mostly like American things
I like anime but I'm a non Japanese but I still don't speak Japanese....

so am I not a weeaboo?

BTW weeaboos disgust me
Yes thank you
Theres this chick at my school. Whitest person ive ever fucking met. But, she HATES the US. She LOVES Japan. I swear she can speak fluent Japanese, and she fucking flirts with it. 
DID I HEAR ATTACK ON TITAN? ATTACK ON TITAN FOR LIFE.
shut the fuck up. you weeaboo.
You need real anime in your life, like Wheel of Fortune.
To the 3,000 weeaboos who disliked, go outside and do something besides fucking your body-pillow.
well i have 3 katanas
what if I just want to learn Japanese nothing els I just find it a cool language
I get all the pusi
and it's scrumdidilyumcious
XD the beginning of the video is hilarious for reasons
XD the beginning of the video is hilarious for reasons
I am a offensive and I find this weeaboo.
the person at 9:56 looks like pbg
Okay, so him with the purple wig: Marlon Brando meets Japan.
weeaboos are a strong and indepent culture I think you should kill your self you fucking atisimo people like you make me want to fsucking kill a 2 year old
Anime is fucking weird
Smoke weed to become a MLGaboo
The term has been so overused it's lost all it's meaning. Get called a weeaboo constantly, even though my picture is not even from an anime. It's literally like calling someone with a thomas the tank engine a weeaboo, because that's basically a western animation.
As a Japanese person ive always been pissed at these people ive jusg never had the word
Fuck weeaboo 


i am japanese



otaku is alright


but otaku show how popular is japan
Frank, you a mean muggin, don't give a damn about ANYTHING kinda mothafucka. Don't ever change.
Why are his pupils so fucking big?! my pupils have never been this big even if iv hading fucking ecstasy and im in a dark room!
im opsest whit making blueprints whats dises for that called??
the fact that some of the anime fans left like, 20 line rants about weaboos.

listen to 0:30 - 1:20

weaboos disrespect culture.
just because you watch anime doesnt make you weaboo. shut up
asian gilbert gotfried?
I love anime and I think Japan is interesting and would like to go there some day. I have a Naruto head ban and a kingdom hearts back pack (no one of those heartless plushy ones it's just a back pack that looks like Sora costume) and 2 KH shirts and personally I would love more anime merchandise but I'm not a weeaboo I'm American I don't know Japanese and I don't watch hentai
I like touhou (Japanese curtain shooter that's hard as fuck) but I only like it for its music (originally) its very orchestral but at least I try to hide it. I'm never going to be a weeaboo.
OMG HE MIMICKED WHAT ANIME GUYS SOUND LIKE PERFECTLY WTF
Sometimes you just got to grow up
At least I respect the culture then. #notaweeaboo ALSO I LIKE DERPS, FULL ON CAPS LOCK AND HEAVY BREATHING
This is the first video I've watched of him and all I can think is: "I love this guy-"
Anime can suck my penis
Hey frank you damn sadist
"Tamas de dank engine.."
this is the first time I have ever watched filthy Frank..... I'm glad it was this video. Liked and Subscribed!! XD
Internet is a weeaboo.
"We support prejudice equality, everyone gets shit" funniest shit I've heard in a while
When he says," are you ready to have some fun?," he's actually saying something about a dead person in his closet.
Now I luv anime but frank u right also RUN FRANK THE WEEABOS CUMING
why do people enjoy anime....the only one I like is RWBY...and studio ghibli bores me.....can I have an explanation?
I don't have an anime avatar....
one piece is so gay they spend 500 episodes trying to find one piece when they could've gone to kfc and got a 3 piece combo with a side of fries and a medium sized drink for 5.99
I've got a Hylian shield and master sword from Zelda, does this count?
that joke always gets me man üòÇ
What's wrong with him?
do a furfag video. fuck those dog fuckers
where has this channel been all my life lmao
That rasengan doe... nice video man
Cory in the House is the best anime
This guy speaks Japanese so fluently, I couldnt figure out if he learned it just for this episode or if hes always known it.
YOU FRANK SOO KAWAI
The subtitles thought!!!!!! XD
Epic
The sad thing is you can see the sadness in their eyes (@TheWeaboos used in the song)
I have cosplay and swords pertaining to that charecter
anime is for kids
9:10

I had that sword. When I was 12.

It was awesome.

When I was 12.
So frank if I buy a survey corp necklaces and a Levi figure does that still make me a weeaboo?
I lost concentration at 8:33 Filthy, I want to have sex with you, what do you say?

And then you get the people who are "proud to be weeaboos."

this is so funny I'm crying! XD
I have a weapon collection. Chinese Broadsword, Gim, Spear, staff.

They used to not be a collection because I used them while learning Praying Mantis, 7 start praying and taichi
you do realize that it is possible to learn SOME Japanese through watching anime with subtitles right? Japanese and Spanish have the same vowels so if you're spanish this makes pronouncing Japanese words a little easier. Just saying. Just like how when you take a foreign language class, they recommend watching TV in the language you're studying due to this helping you learn proper pronunciation. I've also heard that Rosetta Stone is actually good for learning other languages, so that's not a bad thing.
Whats wrong with ur voice
IF you get swords, know how to use them. OR ELSE... Well I don't need to do anything because you'll just cut your arms off on your own.
Daum son i flipped laughing
This guy is fucking hilarious üòÖüòÖ

"I've been learning japanese for ROSETTA STONE for like five weeks"
i was born in cockland but im actullay japanse
I was sent to this told that it was proof Weeaboos aren't disrespecting Japanese culture. I'm actually glad that it was accurate instead of the bullshit I was told it was.
ey b0ss can i habe de pussi pls.
So if I'm to young for college and there's no open classes around, I still can't learn Japanese from Rosetta Stone because it makes me a weaboo?
Anime characters have very big eyes and Anime is asian. 
Wtf
So it's alright to like Japanese culture but don't get to obsess with it and always keeping it touch to your own culture,right?

im so attracted to this man and this is the first video ive seen of him
The thing that pisses me off the most about weebs is their obsession with katanas. They're just... kind of shitty as a sword. They're good for cutting (sometimes stabbing) yeah... if your target has no armour. A katana versus plate armour makes for one damaged katana.
did anyone else think at 4:10 his voice acting was perfect üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Normies gonna norm :P Weeb master race will rule!

I think my friend is turning into a weeaboo. He watches these shitty anime series' which are basically hentai and never shuts the fuck up about them. Every fuckin day at lunch he has to mention some shit about anime. The only good anime series' that he watches are attack on Titan and dragon ball z.
Rosetta Stone
God damn weeaboos........ And im only a anime fan
have i  witnessed insanity?
At 4:10 turn on subtitles
His real voice sounds really good. Anyone else think so? ;D
One of my friends thinks being a weeaboo is a good thing. I still haven't told her what it actually means because I like laughing at the fact that she's pretty much calling herself a fucking loser.
Oh i  just love this guy
Is Frank 51?
I thought I was fluent in english... damn I need a recycling  because I'm having a bad time trying to understand this guy
I have blunt Katanas that are not "collectables" from anime. Ones I can actually use for the historical art called Bikenjutsu. So... yeah I can get why collecting them for some disgusting obsession is pretty, well, filthy
Filthy frank is a Weeaboo
LMFAO! This was funny,
I actually really love Naruto (the message is great) but no I don't pretend to know the Japanese language nor do I forsake my own culture.
Cory in the House is best anime
fucking weeaboo niggers need to be shoved into a concentration camp and gassed their fucking life out
I collect sword but i'm not a weaboo.
I owe papa franku a lot. he saved me...just before I turned into a REAL weeaboo. if he didn't post this video...I would be in my moms attic having sex with a body pillow.
Memes too dank 420/69
I fucking love Corey in the house
Why do SOME white people always try to be an other race black, Japanese what's next native American
Frank never stop doing what you are doing. This is art and it's beautiful.
I used to be in school with this 16 year old girl who watched 2 episodes of this weird highschool Anime, and she was speaking in '' Japanese '' when she was rambling gibberish that she heard on her GLORIOUS Anime!!!!! ~*o*~
Anyway, I was drawling some anime pictures from the anime Kill la Kill ( yeah I watch anime and I enjoy AND RESPECT The Japanese culture and can only speak a couple of Japanese words but eh, I am not Weeaboo. I would really like to go to Japan just cause well, Japan is the shit, they have fucking robots and 22nd century technology. ) but anyway so I was drawling and she was like '' WTF Is that!!! her eyes aren't big enough '' and I turned to her and asked her, What The hell you Weeaboo bitch?!?! You know that's not the way there eyes actually are '' and she raised her hand and was like '' JOSH IS INSULTING ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! '' and the teacher ignored her xD
That day, I really wanted to fucking pick her up by the hair and smash her face into the wall.
:|
Diss on bronies when?
i like mangas 4 the colours
Allright!
damn these guys with anime pic as their avatar
I really enjoy anime but holy fuck, 4:10 - 4:19 was too fucking funny.
"These anime guys will fuck you up?" What you talkin' bout?
Not to much of a big anime fan anmore because of how shit  it is

I love Dragonball Z, I would love to go to Japan, I'm not addicted to watching Anime. It's a hobby, Frank you are pretty fucking Groovy, you dig?

Call me WHATEVER, but in my opinion if youre a 30 year old virgin that has a room full of cartoon shit you need help. I dont care what you say "omg they are not just cartoons, theyre anime" THEY ARE fucking cartoons

After watching this video, I felt my soul had been ripped from my body by the evil demons that live in the Tubes. What am I doing with my life?!
lmao yes I have an anime avatar, yes I do watch anime,  you know what?  I'd like to VISIT japan, I wouldn't speak japanese (other than greetings,  I think it's always polite to greet other people in their language),  I would like to do a lot of stuff including cosplay one day,  but I know how to distinguish the line between anime fan (or Otaku)  and straight up weeaboo,  and I do not like weeaboos for the simple fact that you can't have a good discussion with them,  as soon as you start to diverge from their opinion,  you better be prepared cuz they're gonna throw a lot of shit at you, but hey,  I do agree with 70/75% of what you said,  and dude,  you're funny as fuck anyways,  keep up the good work
you're getting so many sub's now so mainstream :(
I feel ashamed for liking anime because of the stigma of people who do like it are freaks, but as long as no one knows I like anime I'm good.
I want to go to japan cause...



CORN SODA

weeabos are just ugh.... it mean it like anime and respect japan but it don't go to far as weeabos do like if someone talks shit about an anime i like i really don't care... o.o
Instead of Rosetta Stone, don't you mean Google Translate?

Oh, cory in the house, thats my shit right there

Papa Franku has not covered Feminists or furries yet. I hope he gets to those before the Joji album drops.

Annnnd I'm depressed because weaboos are pathetic. Thanks frank..fuckin' asshole :(.
I like anime. I would like to learn Japanese and maybe visit japan but I am not a weeboo or how ever you spell it. I also have figures because they look cool. But I was born in America. I am Canadian American and Russian
i think peta is knocking at the door frank

I like anime and everything, but I can't stand when people constantly bring it up in conversation, or they try to speak Japanese by using words here and there that they learned from anime.
omg i learned japenese
His Japanese is really good. Like im pretty sure he can speak fluent japanese
"My wife is coming to life!" - Weeaboo 2014
he said that there is two guys in his closet in the beginning... i think... i understand some japanese. i heard there is two something in my closet
I shouldn't find this funny... but I do... Help me...
sure soils reported area order to close at the Rock and heating up that he did.
Just because I like Japanese culture doesn't mean I'm a weeaboo.
Toy story, Cory in the house, and Seinfeld are really some of the best anime. But I gotta confess... I watch Cory in the house hentai!!!!! DONT JUDGE ME LIKE THAT!!!!!!!!

Yeet
Has anyone actually realized that what he says at the beginning is not what the subtitles say?
i know this is probably surprising as a question but whats that little piano song in 2:45 xDDDD
Thanks in advance for anyone who sees and delivers
I've watched this video so many times and it's still extremely accurate
What the fuck did he said after the weaboo song..I kept replaying the video and still can't make out of it
In your face! I am Thomas the Tank Engine.
i really do hate weeaboos. it's like, FUCK dude, i like that shit, but i don't want to because you have to sign your soul over to being a fucking loser, or at least be seen as such. and don't even try to talk to them casually, they'll fucking quiz you, literally. 

also, pinkguy looks like Tingle

also, Frank is sexy awesome. i want him to sex me in my aspergers
funny cos this one guy told this one guy and i (we're both have japanese) that we looked like anime characters
he's 52?!
i died of laughter at "nobody practices juitsus in the corner" easily my favorite frank episode :')
ayy b0ss
thomas the frank engine
You actually could be an anime voice actor
Weeaboos: Dubbed sucks so mush omg sub is way better!
Frank, do you know how to properly deal with some weeb trash?
Why are nearly all weeaboos middle aged men, fat, wears glasses and never get the pussi?
my favorite anime is found footage vids of 911
9:08
Yeah he's so weeaboo that he has a European sword.
Who. Is. This. Man?? üòÇ
My nan is a weeaboo
So this is where "Cory in the house is the best anime" shit started. I can take a couple of jokes but god damn it's gotten out of hand. Stop with that shit
i fucking love his vids xD
Guys, watch this with captions on üëçüèª
Why do people think that there asian when they are whit dafuq
at 2:53 he tried to make it sad but he failed
oh god his japanese voice is godly
This is fucking beatiful
even tho i have this profile pic im not a dipshit weeb :3
I hope you get gunned down in the streets like the degenerate you are.
Lol
2pac is the best anime lol
So everyone here thinks furries are trash.
that's nice.

4:38 xDD im dying!
Is this your real voice ?
I'm now scared to turn my volume up because of all the sex noises this guy makes. My sister came in and thought I was watching porn. Chill.

Wuh- where's the subtitles? XD
This is the best anime i have ever watched.
I have profile pic of edward but honestly idgaf about Japan nor if someone talks shit bout anime I just watch some anime that I enjoy.
Tf.. I died at pink guy's "hey boss" lmao üòÇ
So I'm confused... am I a weeaboo if I cosplay and am trying to learn japanese?
This... Is just... Amazing
Omg this is so true
well shit
Holy fuxking shit this was so hilarious.
I googled him...he's doctor.
the only thing I admire about japanese culture is the position they shit in, its better for the rectum
Are you HOW TO BASIC!
Seinfeld is my favorite anime.
filthy frank says the real definition but still people think cosplaying is ultimate weeaboo altough there just fans of a show. Weeaboos are like this: i like japan but there culture is fucking gay an weird. ~ True story üç∑
But if your Asian and if your called a weeaboo what do you say???
This video is fucking gold.
Help, there's this really hot weeabo I know and the only anime I ever watched is Japanese version of digimon.
Faggots
I hate when people call me a weeboo for knowing a little japanese... I just enjoy the culture because it's so VASTLY different from other cultures. I love the sounds of the language compared to a lot of other roman languages. I like linguistics I'm not obsessed with japan.
Yakuza Gaijin boss FTW!
I now think Japan is better then America...

I'm not a weaboo, I'm just saying that women over in Japan actually have decency. Meanwhile in the states, women constantly bitch and moan about "oppression" and "sexism". 

Honestly it's not fuckin rocket science to figure out which country is better behaved.
I legit thought he was Japanese at the start
I FUCKING LOVE YOU
don't deny it your a weeaboo.
is he asian? cuz if not, he really could pull off being one.
best anime is PokeMon
Hello lady and gents this is the amazing frank in a anime http://new3.fjcdn.com/comments/Filthy+frank+body+pillow+anyone+_d882afa8e68547d2af3836d84740c872.jpg

Don't worry I want percy's ass to D:
"I just wanted a piece of percy's ass. ya feel me?"
Fucking Hell That's Hilarious!
"Over here at the Filthy Frank show, we support prejudice equality. EVERYONE GETS SHIT." This is why I love you man
If my girlfriend was a number, she'd be the square root of -1
I think the fact that frank was partially holding in his laughter at certain points in the video, made this 10Xs more hilarious.
Thank you for knowing what a weeaboo actually is.
Your voice is actually the most annoying thing in the world.
6:20 WAS THAT BLACK PARADE üòÅ
this video will be a classic after 20 years and will remember frank for  his weeaboo video
i know a guy who does this except instead of thinking he's Japanese he thinks he's Russian...
he sounds normal when he speaks Japanese
he sounds normal when he speaks Japanese
Srum dillay umchuces
I just realized my sister and my brother is a weeboo
Papa Franku has great taste in anime...
Mind if I go up there and find it for you?
I'm actually legit Japanese but I don't really know anything about Japan (I live in the U.S.) I would really like to start to get to know more about my culture though
bro anime suks fuking dik
this dumbfuck doesnt know shit about anime he doesnt respect weeaboos like me so for that he can go straight to hell. i grew up with anime with my parents and i like it alot so i dont want people fucking with it. hes a fucking prejudice motherfucker who needs to FUCKING DIE OR KILL HIMSELF, FOR NOT KNOWING A SINGLE THING ABOUT JAPANESE CULTURE. fuck this guy he's going to hell
your voice is so fake and annoying

2903 weeaboo pedophiles disliked this lel
the only FUCKING thing that could possibly be even remotely more scary the weeaboos is the mother FUCKING tellytubies
Lmaoooo
First of all It's not Chinese it's Japanese and not Cartoons it's art ! (JK Fuck anime) my personal favourite anime is Winnie Pooh.

i think you are going through puberty
I fucking love it!! CUZ ITS FILTHY FRANK MOTHA FUCKAS..... IT'S FILTHY FRANK BITCH!
EVERYONE gets shit,
im gonna admit, i like anime but not even .01% of what a "weeaboo likes out of it. i find anime another way of just seeing shows like the walking dead or arrow. i dont find it addicting, or by any means very interesting. but dont get me wrong i still like anime. ive watched a couple of shows and theyre pretty good. but its only when i dont have anything else to watch or do. i agree with frank, you can watch or do what ever the fuck you want, just dont take it too far. and what im saying is real. frank is pretty much the guy with my words in this video.
Does anyone have that one friend who runs with their arms up and behind the backs? And screams rusingun (spelling)
i think i am a half weeaboo fucking help me
Thank god I'm not a weeaboo. I don't even watch anime I just listen to Touhou music which I found by originally watching a synthesia version of YMCA because it was stuck in my head.
Rosetta Stone.
Well, I want to go to China for my education. So I'm not a weeabo right?
I hate weeaboos
I hate weeaboos
imagine carrying a baby fetus in your body for 9 months, dealing with the pain of childbirth and random emotions, to have your baby grow up as a weeaboo
How da hell u know Japanese
Chakra is actually a thing.. They are places where you can learn how to enhance mental and physical attributes but sadly we can't do handsigns but we can enhance strength!
filthy frank's 52!!!
cory in the house is my fav annie may
10:21 had me, holy shit
Is that his normal voice because he sounds like one of those people in smoking ads.
Lmao
I learned english playing games, seriously i still cant believe i can speak english .-.
This was funny as hell
It was nice until 5:55 then it went to shit.
To be fair, Japan is a more equill country than America due to their understanding of honor.
Awesome video. My stomach hurts from laughing XD
I just like JoJo and Fist of the North Star.
What the Weeaboo was typing (on the keyboard of course):
lksjakajsdalsdkfhalfahsf;ajkhrgskjarhglskjhtsljksfhlsjdfghdlsfjghdgalhkgdfjklghsdfaskldhasdlakhdskld
U are 52? I just imagined my dad wearing that pink overall suit screaming 'Have you seen that ET please?'in the middle of a park... hahahahah. You're great dude
i had to live with the biggest weeb ever and i felt like i had to hide my adoration for anime...
hahahaha! hilarious video! i watch anime and this is really hilarious xD its really on point in most of the "Otakus" out there trying to change their nationality into japanese +TVFilthyFrank great vid men!
its true watching anime is total waste of time
For those of you who dont know what a weeaboo is, consider yourself lucky
I dont like this video.
At least they
aren't sasaeng fans
hahaha ur too good
it's so true tho watch, fuck you people who say your not a weeaboo, because you probably are.
i wanted to be sani when i was younger or gayer
( Õ°~ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I love anime a lot but I'm not a weeaboo I don't collect a bunch of usless japanese items i don't try to speak japanese and most importantly I'm not an ignorant a**hole
The two jewish men in my closet are now dead. nice frank.
if I had a katana I would use it!!!!!!!!!!!! you don't want to know........
Weeaboos are good for society, like queers, trannies, etc. it gives us people/things to make fun of :D
I like blades and stuff.. And anime.. OH GOD NO PLEASE. At least I don't have a body pillow.
9:20 Physically hurt me...XD
lol
I just realized my old stats teacher was a weeaboo. He has a whole bunch of Japanese stuff all over his classroom and made us read "the manga guide to statistics". He almost made me buy it.
Attack on Titan is draw cancer
ahahahahahahaha!!!! so true!!! I mean this is pretty offensive but his Japanese is fluent his reasoning is true, he is funny so why not shit alover stuff while offending and making ppl laugh lol!
I do the majority of those things, but I do my best to remember my roots. does that make me a weeaboo?
It's called hentai, and it's art.
anime is fuckin trash
I AM BREATHING REALLY HEAVY AND TYPING ON MY KEYBOARD REALLY FAST

Who has anime profile pictures, am I right?
I watch my anime without subs or dubs, because I speak Japanese.
Hahahah! omfg I'm high ass fuck watching this xD
Go to 1:02 and open subtitles.
I'm an Otaku, but i'm not obsessed with katanas, and nor I really want to go to Japan, It's a great country that's for sure, I really like anime,manga,action figures etc......DOES THAT MAKE ME A WEEABOO? XD
While still keeping in touch with THEIR own *
This had me weak cuz it's so true lmao
5 YEAR OLD WEABOOS

Do furries next
Make a vid about weaboos making gay anime porn pics it's called Yaoui
all the otaku's say ayo

I like anime. And I'm okay if people like it as well. there's nothing wrong with it. I used to be an "otaku". Now I'm not. omg I can't STAND it when anime obsessed people talk with Japanese words like "hey your jacket looks sugoi desu. So kawaii." It makes them look retarded like wtf. And when they 'crush' over anime characters... like chill they are drawings.. cartoons.. why are u like fangirling I would understand if it was an ACTUAL PERSON but not a fictional character. Its kinda sad tbh. I tried rewatching some anime and I can't stand the high pitched voices.. its creepy asf. Nobody talks like that.

Moreover I also dont like it when otakus get offended if people call anime a cartoon. it is though. They aren't real people. Manga literally means "comic books" and comic books are cartoons so face reality. Its JAPANESE CARTOONS.

The final thing I dislike is the fact of roleplaying. like '*kills u with katana*' like stop please. Or when they are roleplaying with 2 characters like

Lisel: Hey what's up|| Jack: Shut up dont talk to me.|| Lisel: hmm okay :D

Or

"*blushes* hi Raiyo-kun*" ._.

that's all... ^‚Ä¢^
i em 5 and i liek ninjago i think im a ninja  japense  chnese im learneng chinese n japanses i have swords and throwing stars i saw ppl making a anime version of ninjago i have chibis of ninjago i made kai kawaii

I'm new here. Nice video.

Do you live in Japan?
please please dont call them cartoons
Is filthy frank asian?
Papa Franku I have a question. If my friend is showing signs of becoming a weeaboo, how do I save her? And if I can't save her myself, may I request that you come personally exorcise the weeb demons from her soul?

LET THE JEWS OUT OF YOUR CLOSET FRANK
Theres no way he's 52
I hate it when a white classmate shows me their "anime" drawings and say that it's Kawaii. All they do is get the eyes from Fun2Draw channel and put them on random things. The worst part was when they try to draw people. I tried criticizing them with honesty but they say "whatever" or "its my style". They even show the "artwork" to our teachers and I could see the teacher trying her best not to say "I don't care".
It is scrum-diddly-umptious
They have tentacles in japan I dont wanna go
Hahaha How old are you man?! You look past the age to be having voice cracks lmao...
Filthy Frank show best anime
This video is racist.

#JAPANESELIVESMATTER
this is japan's payback for hiroshima and nagasaki
what is the song when weeaboo jones appears?
whats wrong with rosetta stone?
Attack on Titan is the Walking Dead of anime. 

Both are equally overrated.
YOU HAVE 2 DEAD PEOPLE IN YOUR CLOSET? YO THATS WHACK BRO
Sex
all my friends are weeaboos ;-;
The character of Frank is 52, the real man is 20 or so
"I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass"

LMAO
Black Jesus supports this.
I've been watching anime for a day and I think I should go to Japan because I'm a professional at being Japanese you guys don't even know! And I also live in my mother's garage while fapping to Pok√©mon. And I named my katana senpai. 
(I'm being sarcastic lol)
I've been avoiding this video for a long time now and I don't even know why.
Thank you Filthy Frank! Love these videos. Though the katanas do look cool
Geek/Culturalist: Likes Japanese culture and/or anime.
Weeaboo: Eats, sleeps, and breaths Japan.
having so much sex with a pillow that it stands on its own is hilarious

I do find the fascination with Japanese culture plainly abnormal.  I don't really care but it is odd
Honestly, I don't care if you make fun of anime. In fact, have you posted something about that? If so, I'd love to have a laugh!
So, telling by the comments. I am a Weaboo even if I just watch animated shows meaning by, 'Anime'?
5:11 the tiny smile in the end makes it funnier

whats wrong with your voice
Just watched the beginning with subtitles to see what Youtube would understand, this makes no sense.
Best bad guy losing movie ending
Bro watch this shit with subtitles on its funny af
ey b0ss
lemme be your waifu
lemme into your life you weeb
i only want to go to japan because i want to become a mangaka and because it looks like a good place to live
This was in the anime section of my youtube recommended videos. Wow.
Does he actually say "this is my house" to the pigeon, I'm pretty sure it isn't someone plz translate <3
Wait...Where is frank from if he isnt Japanese??
lol
Weeaboos go to Japan like "Where the California Roll"
Am I a weeaboo if I used to live in Japan and I am finishing learning the language so I can move back
I lost it when he said no one practices jutsus in the corner. I still like anime but  I remember when I was younger and my whole mp3 list was just theme songs and endings to different animes. I cringe at the memory of myself.
Cory in the house
Does he know Japanese?
why u sound like pewdiepie
My favorite animes are bakugan and beybade
Yaaas I fucking hate anime
Considering the target demographic, anime is clearly Japan's revenge on the West for Fat Man and Little Boy.
I am sure everything has its own "weeaboo", not just anime
dang weeaboos are scary
also bronies
Even weeaboos are laughing at this
Lol hahaha WEEABOOS I thought he was gonna talk about the chinese WEIBO
"We support prejudice equality"hmmm the irony is strong with this quote
You actually sound japanese...
‚Ä¨ ‚Ä¨ ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¨
I lost it at when Thomas appeared on the screen.
only reason i want to go to japan is because i herd their education system is pretty OP, unless i know the secret behind the true japan i have no need to go. But i would like to visit along with other places like Germany
best thing ever the truth comes out, i can finally can descend  to my rightful place in hell
True
can somebody explain the joke at 5:42
Daymn, Frank sounds so sexy in the beginning
I need to learn a couple of cool phrases
What the fuck is wrong with his voice?
NOW BEFOoooooRE
All you bleach,naruto,fairy tail,death note,etc cosplayers kill yourself
Papa's japanese is sexy.
How the hell can you watch this lame ass videos
To be honest he could be a good anime voice actor. im not the biggest anime fan but Tokyo ghoul, attack on titan, naruto. i like.
lol is that peanutbuttergamer in the weeaboos song at 9:56
I love anime, but i don't want to be Japanese, like I don't even mind. I do speak japanese sometimes, like
OREWA OMULETTOO DAISUKI NANDAYO
and some other shit...
but I have a bit evangelion collection, and I think Japanese culture pretty interesting, and i wanna visit japan... what does that make me?
EDIT: WOW i was fucking gay back then
This shit literally had me in fucking tears, great fucking job man!

Please do one on these idiotic SJWs.
"My name is cowboy Tanaka" Lmao!
Hentai....is..........Bestai?!
Best video ever
Did he make the weeaboo song
I dislike Japan been there multiple times for extended periods of time. It sucks, they don't really like outsiders being black was definitely a struggle for me. The food is good though
Oh... Weeaboo... Damn
The creatures know as weaboos, is condition often referred to as a disease or illness, it is nothing of the sort, it's an uncontrollable plague of a vile, putrid, filth. The first stages of "weaboo-ization" (the process of becoming a weaboo) first the patient should feel the urge to withdraw of civilization, their hygiene now at minimum, second, the addiction of what is known as "anime" has now reached a religious standpoint within the mind, causing the patient to have the impulse to wear, buy, and hoard items and clothing of anime origin. Third, the patient gains the ability to mentally seek other weaboos, creating groups, often referred to by the type of anime the group enjoys "packs" for furries, and "hoards" for action loving weaboos. no matter the name, all are equally dangerous and contagious, their very breath a sickening poison. I leave this comment saying this, their race must be eradicated, their stain of filth must removed from the gene pool. Permanently, no matter the cost.
I collect katanas for decorative purposes and because I am taking tai kwondo soon sorry I probably butchered the spelling of tai kwondo
5 disgusting internet dwellers 

1) anyone under 15

2) weeaboos

3) Internet atheist

4) furries

5) bronies
(Serious)
This has a beautiful message to not just weaboos,but all fans as well.
i cant Pause the Video for some reason Boss xD

Cory in the house is my favorite anime
arab feet are my fetish
I'm learning Rosetta Stone on Japanese, fuck da system

Some of the best and filthiest. Thank you Franku senpai.
Did anyone else not know what this was going to be before watching it and have their eyes/ears burn off from not being prepared?
Cory in the house Fuck yeah
7:56 frank got me hard
Someone explain the cory in the house joke please
I've accidentally learned Japanese from anime put I don't actually try to. There are a lot of things I admire in Japanese culture. But I can also realize that there are bad things in it too, like every other culture on Earth.
The only thing that is worst than a weeaboo is two weeaboos arguing about who has hotter waifu.
I have a friend 
WeeaBoos
Im in that dark part of youtube now

TF THIS DUDE DISSIN MY FAV ANIME
How to be a famous mangaka:

1. Create a story that involves one man and shit-loads of women
2. Make the girls go crazy over on that one guy.
3. Make sure That guy is dense as fuck.
4. More oppais and bigger oppais
5. Hentai hentai hentai

Top kek
the face he nade whne he said hey bossxD
you are annoying as fuck omgüòê
Fukn weeaboos man
I find it funny that this seems to overly focus on male weeaboos, when female weeaboos are just as bad. If not worse.
I have found the best channel in the world
I knew this guy was dangerous when he fucked that pidgeon up
G.I.JOE,  Dora the explorer, and FOX News my favorite animes
"Please notice me"
"Please no Lewis"
"I knew this day would come"
"paper cup guys yeah"
I cried when I watched this. It made me realize how fast IR (Internet Retardation) is spreading. These innocent people have been taken by this disease. Let us say a prayer for all the people that because of the Internet have become Weaboos, Squeakers, Bad Internet Rappers, Bronies, and just complete asses. Save us Frank. Your our only hope!
Teen titans is my favorite hentai
2,800 weeaboos dislike this.
lmao i loved this video so much new subscriber!
Little known fact: I'm part Japanese, and I hate anime.
This is so offensive to people who watch anime
Don't you just hate it when you see people on YouTube impersonating anime characters?
i crack up everytime he is in that pink costume and makes this face xD
icantbreathe
HAVE A GREAT DAY BITCHES B==D
And probably no ones gives a shit about what i wrote but i dont really have what to do so ill go find someone to ruin his life dreams etc.
Sorry for my english o and one more thing to say.Animes are projections of the peoples imagination its about originallity and having fun wscaping from reality for a short period of 20 - 40 mins per day because lets say you have a preatty busy program as a kid and you dont have time to go play outside with your friends in the course of the 5 days when you go to school for example if you go to school from 1 pm to 8 pm you cant do shit.WEEABOOS JUST RUINED THIS.
k
Hellooo guys.I am here to ruin your life.Well i have something to say to all weeaboos i like anime as well but seryously i just typed weeaboos on internet and went on images.Best mistake in my life.WTFF IS WRONG WITH YOU GO GET A FUCKING LIFE YOU REALISE THAT WHEN YOUR PARENTS WILL DIE AND THEY WILL PROBABLY DO THAT SOON BECAUSE OF THEIR FUCKING 40 YEARS OLD SON STAYING IN A FUCKING DARK AND STINKY ROOM WATCHING 16/24 HOURS ANIMES WILL SUICIDE AND YOU WILL HAVE TO SELL YOUR HOUSE AND LIVE ON STREETS LIKE FUCKING RATS EATING SHIT ALL DAY?.So please go get a life.
jones was using shadow clones as sharingans, that's when you know he's full-on weeaboo
i guess Weeaboos are just retarded tryin to be Japanese FUCK TO U¬¨!
hey have u ever thought that weebs deserve respect (already laughing my ass of at the incoming comments defending and attacking weebs)
see, colkecting swords isnt bad i myself enjoy it and am a HEMA member. but nobody ever should support weeaboos collecting swords especially real,sharp, functioning ones
i sent this video to one of my worst weeaboos autistic friends who goes on gay anime rpg sites and he just said he didn't need subtitles to understand everything Franku said in japanese bc he learned the language on his own.
should i kill him to end his pathetic existence or should i kill myself
Personally I agree with everything except the anime profile pic thing.
Eh, talk shit about attack on titan, what do I care. Not a Weeaboo
weapon collecting is weeaboo like? good thing i only have a fruit knife...
I think I am the only one who didn't get insulted or disgusted when they watched a Filthy Frank Video. And I know about this channel for a while.
Also I think I will now change my CoD ghosts pick into an anime character
Everyone need to watch this !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
anime: Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko 
Yes, it says HENTAI in it but dont be fooled !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Luckily I aint one.
6:28 
THAT MEANS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING HAHAHAHA
Oh man, I love Cory in the House

Best anime 2016
Would watching anime and respecting the culture enough to learn the language be considered a weeaboo? (I watch anime [obviously] but the language is very smooth in my opinion and I think it'd be nice to learn.)
I only like cool anime like Berserk and Wolf's Rain so I think I'm safe
if 4chan was a guy
Lol this is so funny my chest hurts,  because I know some people like this xD
OK, no, seriously, I need help. What's the sad piano music that plays when he laments about Thomas the Tank Engine? It's driving me crazy.
2:45
I watch anime and I don't pretend to be Japanese I'm not I'm Puerto Rican and I'm proud but I don't see how having a anime avatar is being a weeaboo when a weeaboo is acting Japanese? ( pls don't kill me I'm Just asking a question xdddddd)
I FUCKING LOVE YOU
Time for my monthly doses of cancer!!!!
I'm a anime fan and even I get scared by weeaboos
i'm not a weaboo, but an anime. people tell me all the time that they're the same thing, but what they dont understand is, animes have their own distinct culture.
Whe-Where are the subtitles? - WEEABOOS 2014
I have actually been wanting to learn how to speak Mandarin/Japanese. It would be nice to be able to speak it fluently! It sounds bad ass when your telling people off too!
Can't be a pedo when i'm 13: )
you have balls to make this video my friend... i like that.... respect earned...(subscribed.)
Skip to 6:00 for dementia.







(I do agree with the core message of the video, it's just the rest is plain retarded)
oh shit, they are coming for me, I can hear them breathing heavy and I can hear the keyboard keys being hit really fast, Frank HALP ME
do weaboos even exist?
His voice make me have orgasms

1. Anime Profile Pic. : WHy not of you like it.
2. Using the Japanese Language wrong...true, only retards act like they know the language if they dont
3. Cosplay: hmmm i dont really care but ... if sb enjoys it
4. Owning a katana: makes you a weaboo unless you know how to really use it NOT JUST WATCHING SOME ANIMES AND   THINKING OK EZ
5. Liking animes: nothing wrong about it, just if you bitch around about the plot or whatever
6. liking the culture: as long as you understand it and not rape it its k
7. Hentai & whatever: hmm ;)
Anime writers are really lazy, sometimes the bloody screen doesnt move except the characters mouths for like 5 seconds when they are 'talking'.
"Where are the subtitles" Fucking perfect.
lol i love u HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Anime is retarded.
Everyone just watches that crap for the rape. Well that's why I watch it anyway.
10 seconds in im already busting in the floor laughing

7.5/10, too much body fluids, Crusty socks, and Body Pillows
I'm not a weeaboo. I just really like this character.
I like watching anime, but I'm no weeaboo, Japan's culture sucks.
the only reason I would ever go to Japan is for the awesome Megaman and Dragon Ball Z figures
WHAT THE FUCK MAN FUCKING HEAVY BREATHING DONT TALK ABOUT NARUTO LIKE THAT WKONMKWDNKWLMSNSM;A;NAFNFAS ASFN;FASKJFNASFD  ASLFAFHLFA Im coming for you....

my favorite anime is fapping
Just joining the trend of liking filthyfranks comment
Do this with fnaf, good luck surviving the apocalypse
Holy shit, I really like anime and this shit is so fucking funny, awesome, and true. Keep it up and FUCK EVERYONE, EVERY RACE, AND EVERY THING NOT FUCKED
ashton kutcher sounding motherfucker
5:10 is the best part of this vid
Dubs not subs.
I will try to translate at 4:10 with the Japanese i learned from anime
"Shit ?????????? What is it? No, stop!" 
" it can't be" "I don't know anything"
10:09 If I ever became that I will post my address on the internet and give anyone the right to end my life, but quickly.
OH NO! I HEAR THE CAPS LOCK TRIGGERING!
I used to like anime. I used to be a full blown weaboo. You know, that one girl in the back of the class that brings manga to school and listens to Vocaloid exclusively, chanting "SUBS" all day. Ugh. Then, I fucking grew up. I realized how stagnant the industry is, how every anime is practically the same, and that the community is utter shit. Why can't other people do that, dammit? Now, anime makes me want to throw up lol
Anime sucks
Bro, jumping the tank engine god me to subscribe. keep up the good work!
i wanna visit japan one day
Weaboos are just sad.
Omg when he said Cory in the house I died. Someone help I can't breathe.
I lost my shit when I saw Sasuke at Hooters omfg thats golden
pull back on the reverb on your songs m8
u are so ugly omg
This is my favourite video :)
this goes for koreaboos too. I mean i love kpop A LOT but omfg
Gomenasai YouTube, my name is Ken-Sama.
I‚Äôm a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)
I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.
I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%
When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!
I feel the schools saying "kids have the freedom to let there colors shine" plays a large role in the spread of weeabooism
IMPORTANT COMMENT READ NOW
I've made a petition to reboot the Cory in the House anime, please sign it so we can have this wonderful show back again.
https://www.change.org/p/walt-disney-make-another-season-of-cory-in-the-house
japanese people are the only people in the world who get offended by people showing interests in their culture. Literally the only people. and think so highly of themselves while everyone who likes their culture outside of japan is like a peasant. Their logic escapes me.
Who likes amine? Lmao
Your japanese is sexy b0ss ^_^
I should watch Filthy Franku-sama every time I sleep.
you are so fucking dum
Hello, I'm a anime/manga fan and I have to say to all those fans who buy action figures (Etcetera), WAKE THE FUCK UP. The guy that made this video deserves a Oscar for being the one to announce a wake up call. I like anime/manga but buying collectibles is just going to far. You need to realize that this world is filled with great things but buying action figures is just dumb as fuck. The people who sell those collectables must be laughing there asses off, to be honest I would be laughing too for fooling 10 year olds - 60 year olds. Anyways the moral is WAKE THE FUCK UP! -I am prepared for the hate comments- Hides in shelter
Oh god, this was so funny!
Thanks, man, I laughed my ass off! :D
Praise you /\
I know at the end you say you really don't care about these people,but YOU MADE A VIDEO. I think if you dedicated so much time to this,you offended a ton of people,too!!!
XD
"im a hustler"
i feel you frank, i feel you
@JohanChan HAHAHHAHAHHAAH\
so what should i call non-bavarian people yodeling around in lederhosen, drinking beer and celebrating an oktoberfest in other countries?
I like how this video starts with a explanation of what weeaboos are and then it is about making fun of not weeaboos, but basically just western anime fans. You can be a hardcore anime fan, hug/shove your dick up dakimakura and still NOT be a weeaboo. Simple as that.
Yeah, weeaboos are pretty stupid. I prefer spending my time productively, playing on My Little Pony roleplay Minecraft servers.
Those people with the anime avatars are the worst!
frank i love your videos ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° 
You seriously make my days when their just shitty.
Hope you visit Houston, TX!  :D
what the fuck is wrong with his voice
THAT MOCKING ANIME BOYS VOICE IS ON POINT AS F üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Me tho üòÇüòÇüòÇ
dam so whats in ur closet?
LET ME JUST MAKE THIS VERY FUCKING CLEAR FOR EVERYONE:¬† it doesn't matter how much you like anime.¬† It doesn't matter if you like it a little bit, or a lot.¬† The only thing that makes you a weeaboo, is when you suddenly think you're Japanese,¬†when you are clearly not.¬† that's really it... theres no need to argue about it ._.
Anime is like Jesus only it doesn't save you or take away your sins it throws you to hell and ruins you
I just want to say that collecting swords,guns, any type of weapons has nothing to do with being a weeaboo, and has nothing to do with being a criminal. Also, you're a filthy inbred piece of shit cunt, go get herpes from your mothers asshole :)
I'm gonna admit that I don't like people to talk badly about AOT, but I do not want to learn Japanese ;-; or use chopsticks.
My favorite anime is Thats So Raven
my favorite anime is spongebob i have a pillow of with sandy on it
holy fudge.  how do you still have a throat after recording that? XD
ROSSETA STONE......
I collect weapons but I can actually use them. and yes I mean guns and knives.
B0ss please! gimme da pussi!
I've been watching anime since I was around 5, I'm now 15 and still hold that passion. I don't consider myself any of these terms. I just enjoy the culture of Japan, from their beliefs to their music, and their language is it's beautiful. It's all amazing to me. Yes I love anime, yes I own some merch from multiple animes. But I in no way, shape or form hold anything but respect for Japan. It's more then anime people, understand that. If you truly love the culture, you are none of these terms. These terms are for people who over exaggerate and toss aside respect in favor of being an annoying immature child.
wtf man Shindeiruuuu 2 inside your closet ?
I was expecting frank to rape that pigeon
SHIT
what happened
6:56 EY b0ss!
I Dont Watch Anime..... And I Dont Do The Weaboo Stuff
I think this video may of took a part in making weeaboos.

I needed this. Videos like this remove my need to vent.
How old is he?
If you haven't noticed yet, almost all the pictures are with guys with Anime chicks.
The guy in the image at 9:57 looks awfully like PeanutButterGamer. :v
I may have seen this video 12 times now b0ss

Otakus: So wanna talk about sao?
WEABOO: what does sao mean?



      ME:  AKWARD SILENCE
does frank wear braces?
I can't tell
rocking in fetal position "Rosetta Stone"
xD ok i agree with him except with the weapon thing like i think collecting anime weapons is fine its just decoration or for cosplay no big deal
i hate anime
Yeah its good that they like Japan but they think they know more than any1
Filthy Frank for Voice Actor in an Anime
These are actually good points...
....cartoon anime hentai FUCK  YOU DONT MAKE FUN OF THEM
Edgy.
so is it wrong to have a picture of an anime avater ?
I wanted to get some of that Thomas the tank engine ass as well
Totally agree but why you speak like a screami guy from metal band
There is a terrible misconception of anime because just like every group of people there are a few assholes who ruin it's reputation.
gay
When I was nine years old I was exactly like this I was a grade A weabooooooo
why does he talk like that
Press 4 and 7. Add to your porn collection.
lol at 6:28 he said "i love vagina" subs wrong
Mordecai and rigby is my favorite anime, Cory in the house is good but it's too mainstream and slow character development.
This makes me sad
National weaboo bleach day is today. Hope to god they follow through.
Anyone else like Frank's singing voice a lot? xD
Also: not all weaboos have anime profile pics. Might wanna watch your mouth more, cuz it's offending some people.
5:16 Joker voice
Make fun of ebola, black Africans and sexy sluts, and no one bats an eye...
Make fun of anime and everyone loses their minds!
i dont get it is frank japanease australic or amarican
Is there a japanese dub of this video?
what's with his voice?
Konichiwa....ROSETTA STONE
He just wanted a bit of DAT Percy ass
lol i'm Japanese and the subtitles are false at the beggining he says, "let me tell you something interesting, i have 2 Jews in my closet, there both dead" XD
Pink Guy is my wallpaper for my PC
wtf is wrong with your voice? XD
thanks frank, now all the 12 year olds are going to be like "YOU SAID ANIMA YOUR A WEABOOOOOOOOO"
He Sounds Like Brook From One Piece
lol
i love anime and the Japanese culture, but i not go as far as the weeaboo,

great video dude
Rosetta Stone
I think I saw PBG in the weeaboo song images
I'm not a weeaboo but I do love kakashi xD
lajessiqua wally
When he said
Are you ready to have some fun?
in Japanese he said in my closet there is 2 people inside and they are dead 
lol
So this is where everyone learned the word weeaboo from. A few years ago, I didn't bother to call people this because no one even knew it was a wordüòÇ

But seriously, i think you'd voice the mc of an anime-mocking anime pretty well^^
Story of my live
Tbh this guy's channel is alright, you see it seems as if this video talks about the over obsessed anime fans. Liking anime, watching SOME hentai, etc are fine. But yes, not showering cause of cosplay, fucking a body pillow every night, etc are bad. You can have anime collections, who's gonna stop you? But honestly there's a point between Anime Fan and "weeb." Liking anime or having an anime profile pic doesn't make one a "weeb."
also, to be an anime it must originate from a manga and be made in Japan.

Although his fans are in-fucking-sane. They will literally harass anyone for being a brony, furry, fnaf fan, anime fan, etc. Like, chill the fuck out, damn. He don't hate those people excactly. If they aren't doing anything bad why harass them?
Hitler is the true hero here
FUCK YOU FRANK YOU CANT ESCAPE. BREATHES HEAVILY
omg xD

"Where are the subtitles?"
that's where I knew this would be a great video xD
TVFilthyFrank I have flagged this video for terrorism due to your sexist, racist and unfriendly ways. I do not appreciate what you said about me, a anime enthusiast and body pillow collector.
I will be telling my lawyer to contact you and a dispute will be happening very soon. I would also like to note Corey in the House is not a anime because there is no body pillow for it up for purchase on Amazon. I am very mad about this and I am going to make sure I sue you for everything you got (I need a new body pillow for Esdeath from Akame Ga Kill! I keep producing semen inside a hole I cut in the bottom) 

sincerely 
-leaf a like HISSSSS
HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE DAIJOUBU <X3
where is frank from?
My favorite anime is 



Deez Nuts
My friends call me a Weeaboo and it pisses me off. I like anime a lot. what's the big deal? Yeah I find Britain a shithole and I find Japan a beautiful place and I would rather live there. I don't think that I am a weeaboo at all
i laughed to death at this part 4:33
So like. There was a huge weeb war in the comments lol. They were all yelling at each other.
You showed cosplays by people who are overweight. Does it mean that these ppl can't make cosplay and it's the fun only for slim and pretty people? I think it's not good. Most people think that only faties can be weeaboos and this is not true. I don't like discrimination because of their weight. I bet if young, beautiful girl with big titties do cosplay(being total ignorrant¬†idiot who doesn't have any infromation from Anime&Manga world) no one would care. So please. If you're making video like this, don't put there only photos of overweight people.
I wanna move to japan for dat 'rasan gan' yo.
well i do like anime,  i dont mind cosplay ( not that i will ever do it) cause some girl just look pretty good on them.  but crap going all out full retard mode on some1 else culture while rejecting your own and the sad part if that i bet they think that real JP act like they do on anime....... feelbadman
Wheres the subtitles XD
Fuk yeh watanays
Bruh my friend is a weeaboo ;-; she thinks if she runs like a Naruto character it actually makes her faster than anyone like wtf
This is the funniest sht ive seen ever.
I don't see how wanting to learn Japanese makes someone disrespectful to the Japanese culture while being a fan of anime
his japanese voice sound so different than his english
~Has an anime figure for my avatar...~ I'm fucked, aren't I?

Since when did youtube comments become a fusion of 4chan, reddit and tumblr?
Not their best parts either.

Everyone that fuckin hisses deserves to be punched over the head with a fucking wheel barrow in the slight hope they seem to regain some brain mess and understand that their little meme is worse then fucking bob and is well a noob level meme get on master level meme or get out.

HISSSSSSSSSSSSS
tfw every single pleb starts liking his channel
What about white people who were born and raised in Japan? They are culturally Asian, went to Japanese school, and probably know Japanese just as well as English.
4:10 He actually could make a good voice actor for anime's, not going to lie
is that guy in 9:58 pbg
What's anime
Anime is shit.
But on that note of masturbating to 13 year old school girls, Pico is the shit.

Cory in the House is my favorite anime.
Why does frank remind me of tingle from Zelda............?

The difference between a weaboo and an actual Japanese person is that a weaboo can put out a small fire on a live stream.
I DIED

anime is gay...
who the fuck watch this japanese cartoon  bull crap this is so stupid
Wow, I finished this video. I`m going to watch anime now. Guilty Crown's the next on my list, if you want to know. Ja ne!
Damn! I based my avatar from 101 Dalmatians, my favorite anime movie. Guess I'm one too.
That wasn't very cash money of you
All I like is anime so does that make me a Weeaboo...
Demolition D+ but the American version.
you're 52? xD
The only redeeming factor of the weeaboo slideshow, was that someone had a Watchmen book.
Who shoved a good ol' rasengan up your ass? LMAO.
every time i see this im reminded of those days when weeaboos enter my presence. those people are fucking scary. i criticize attack on titan or naruto or whatever mainstream anime, and these fucks breathe fire. they fucking equip their spells or go super saiyan, unlock some reference and beat you down like jesus christ
I'm at a cross road. I have a friend who is a 1st level weaboo. She is on her 3rd anime and has bought some merch. I'm not to sure that she is too far gone. Should I try to stop it before it gets bad or should I end it to end it to defend the masses?
Attack on titan is bad.                                                                                                                                          Here comes the horde!

I'm Japanese and if you listen to what he says in Japanese it's nothing like the subtitles

This was...beautiful. I am in love.
This was the most hilarious video that I have ever watched xD

disgusting ass weeaboos
All the fuckin' weebs need to be extinct.
ey b0ss. you are so great that ma nipples rotate 420 degrees
that's true though, weeaboos are freaky people. you can be racist, a pervert, a masochist, you can even be a goddamn terrorist and no one gives a shit. but once you say one negative thing about anime. these people grab their cosplay katanas, pull out their keyboard maybe in an anime skin for whatever reasoning, and breathe fire. like jesus fucking christ, CALM YOURSELF! if you dont want to hear comments about your anime, then dont make it obvious you like said anime, or go offline kn general, because lets face it. the internet is a fucked up place the moment it became accessible to the public.
h
um....y r all the weeaboos overweight? is that like a criteria for being called a weeaboo?
Hilarious, subbed.
I wanted to be thomas¬†the tank engine too :,(
this is about me whoops
1:55 Franku-senpai, you missed a golden opportunity to say "my waifu is coming to laifu" but I guess not.
i think Alex from '' i hate everything''  and Filthy Frank should do a cross over
Your Japanese is hot

I have a message for all you weeaboos out there. STOP USING THE FUCKING CAPS LOCK JUST BECASE YOUR ANIMATED GIRLFRIEND GETS INSULTED FOR EATING TOO MUCH ASS ON THE INTERNET! GO GET A REAL GIRLFRIEND AND HAVE REAL MAKEOUT SESSIONS AND REAL SEX AND ALL THAT BULLSHIT!
Gimme da pussi b0ss!

I hate people with anime profile pictures..... there so fucking anoying -.-
Bee Movie is my favourite anime
Thomas The Tank Engine is my favourite anime hands down
You can play a recorder with your nose? That's a talent.
One guy I know claims he is half dragon and thinks he has two waifu's.  All he ever posts about is cosplay, anime, pics of dragons and talking about what abilities his dragon form has and how come he can't get a girlfriend. Some girl I know is obsessed with anime foxes, thinks she is part fox and threatens to bite your face off if you don't like anime.  She has really bad teeth and purposely sticks her crooked fangs out and snarls and growls.  One guy watches anime all day and threatened to kill everyone when he bought a katana.  He tried cutting his hair like some anime character so his hair was literally a bowl cut on the front and the back but the sides came down to his chin. Some other girl I know also anime obsessed thinks she has some ancient spirit inside her and threatens to unleash it on the world if she is upset. Sad thing is all these people are early to mid 20's....
This is my favorite vidoe
The 2k guys who disliked it are weeabs and they cant accept it! :D
Fuck anime.

I wonder what frank's kids would be like. I hope they carry on the tradition.
I used to be a weeaboo when I was younger... xD
But im not so obsessed with anime anymore. I still like it though and talk about it sometimes.



weeaboos freak me out
my girlfriend was a weeaboo and she wanted to talk on the phone for hours, and all she ever talked about was anime to the point where i lost my sanity, broke up with her, and now im pretty much disgusted by anime and japanese people.
I have a shortsword collection because of the versatility and durability. Sure you can cut jerks in half with a katana...how many times? And how much does it cost? Oh, okay. Yeah, I could shank dickbags from 2.5ft (about 4.5-5ft with arm length) away some couple thousand times before I need to sharpen my sword...
Slimsword= $315
Shortsword= $227
Cost of a can of WD40= $6
Cleaver sharpening rod= $19.99
Any random rag I find= $0.75 (laundromat)
Scabbards were $35 each.
Let people like dress up as fucking Miku but that makes no sense I get that they past there fucking shit with them and then that I'm no weeabo don't get me wrong I love anime but I don't dress up or shit like that just let them celebrate this won't change them
At least I'm an Otaku
i collect weapons and love anime but my weapons can be used
Who else thought frak was the weirdiest youtuber then slowly got to the point where you laughed at vids like these so hard you needed to eat fetuses for breakfast for nutrition while playing black metal and shoving asparagus up a lizards ass
Best anime hands down is iCarly!
Anal annihilation.
Weeaboos and bronies. Can there be something worse?
LEAF A LIKE HISSSSSSSSSSSSS...

Watashi Wa Weeaboo-dess!!!! (XD)
Spongebob is the best anime, boss

My defence. 13 is legal in Japan raises eyebrows

Hearing his voice makes me want to clear my throat.
I had a Japanese commercial before this video.
HISSSSS
Is he half Japanese?
I might be a weaboo and not even know it. I don't have a sword collection, but I am all the stuff FilthyFrank said. I don't want to be a weaboo, but I honestly think America fucking sucks because of the economy. :-/
4:11 HOLY SHIT THIS IS EXACTLY HOW EVERY ANIME CHARACTER TALKS OR REACTS EVER!!
I haven't laughed that hard for months omg. fucking subscribed
Do Furries! 



Note: I'm not a Weeaboo. I just find the Senpai shit hilarious. Please don't crucify me.
i feel bad for knowing most of the girls and knowing wich anime they are from
1:19 is that based of a real anime or one of these random photos things
I think my cousin is a weeaboo
this guy is totally virgin
May I ask a question? If I collect manga because I like reading books in general, am I counted as a weeaboo? I read normal books as well, just curious?
I watch anime and I get called a weeaboo for it. EVEN THOUGH IT'S ENGLISH DUBBED.
these comments here are the best
Do Furries.
all you fucking weaboos just got burned ha ha
I only have an anime avatar because alucard is awesome
Wow. i wanna suck franku's eyeballs out through his asshole.
OTTOCK ON TOTON
So much weeaboos on the comments of einshine theanimeman and nyansai or nyanstrike
I've either wanted to go to Japan or Australia for  a school year. My mom went to Japan for her senior year of high school and she got treated very oddly cause she is a Irish woman with black curly hair. I wanna see what it's like outside of America.
In the song montage I didn't see any weeaboos I just saw a couple of beached whales.
Imagine just walking into a room, not knowing what he was doing at 7:55 XDD

What the fuck did I just watch...
Am I the only one who's gonna point out that after he said welcome the subtitles where completely different then what he said XD
I agreed with all of this except for when you said EVERYONE with anime avatars are weeaboos. i like anime. but im not a weeb. i changed my profile pic to an anime character. how am i a weeb? thats like if someone said they like video games so you start calling them a no life looser. you can like video games without being a no life. you can like anime and change your profile pic to an anime character and not be a weeb.
And also don't forget the people that name them self an anime characters/Youtuber, also known as Wannabe
Why the hell do people even put porn as their profile picture?¬† That just screams "HEY EVERYONE! I AM A PERVERT!".
anime sucks balls
lol XD fakin weeaboo !
What if you live in Japan, and you sometimes go to Comic conventions or Anime conventions, does that make me a "Weeaboo"? I think I have like one manga. But oh I hope I do not become one of those things. Deer god.
Im suprised you didnt get any hate. Good job
I understand the normal kids movies etc. but the anime shit where there are little girls looking like 10-14 and they are half naked... that's just sick and you people sicken me who watch them. Anime = shit.
help this is me in a nutshell </3
Anime = Hentai

Flithy Frank:Adult Swim Edition

MAKE IT HAPPEN
Does anyone here love Shrek as their favorite anime?
This'll probably get buried in the sea of comments but for anyone who doesn't really "Get" who he's making fun of, it's the people who reject their own culture and try to be Japanese instead because they've got some romanticised idea of what Japan is 'cause of anime. The ones who have an obsession with Japan to the point that they try so hard to be Japanese/whatever anime character. It's pretty much escapism gone really bad, usually means they can't really deal with real life very well or just aren't getting what they want out of it i.e. their life is shit. 

That being said people acting like they can rip into anyone who fits the criteria and treat them like shit just cause it seems like papa franku said so are pretty pathetic too lol. I mean fuck he said all this in the video and a ton of people still don't get it. This video created so much stigma, just look at the people in the comments section looking for validation that they're not weebs and shit. It's pretty awful. This video alone could justify Frank not liking his fanbase to be honest.

Please, fake Harry Potter fans.
HE'S 52?
Does my prof pic count?
Once upon a time I got into a discussion (which quickly turned into an argument) with a Weeaboo.
All I remember was him saying Anime made in America isn't Anime, it's American Cartoons.
ROSETTA STONE
wtf i don't get it  .. 
he is a genius.
XDD i have this guy in my class who watches anime and always acts japanese. He says stuff like "MAJIKA!?" When a teacher teaches us something that he has never heard of. When hes stressed he usually acts like an anime dude with a messed up love life and says "I QUIT I QUIT IT ALL!!!" 

It was so hilarious when he tried to confess to a girl under an oak tree that was about to be cut down. XDDDD
9:10 I don't wanna be "that guy", but that's not even a Japanese weapon. it's a longsword...
hey b0ss! <:))
"Where are the subtitles??" I can't breathe anymore üòÇüòÇ
You know what's really anoying? People calling themselves Otaku, as if it's any better. And before you get salty and start breathing really heavily, saying that being otaku is just being a fan of anime,look up the definition, it literary means a young person that's obsessed with pop culture to the point where it fucks up their social life.
WEABOOS ANNIVERSARY
weabos r bed
Seinfeld is such a good anime
if you watch anime your probably ugly and have a small dick
I don't see anyone in my mom's attic. Its only me

I just started learning Japanese a few months ago, I'm an expert now.
weren't you considered yourself as a weeaboo too?
weeboo Jones haha ha
Lol
im here to get hate on my profile picture :V
My 2 favorite anime's are The Jeffersons and Frasier.
Anime is awesome, but fucking weeaboos man... fuck. They give anime fans a bad image because of how fucking annoying they are. It is understandable though, since weeaboos usually are missing a few chromosomes.
2,660 weeaboos dislike ):
Dude! Please don't tell me those weaboo pictures are real!  Grose! Disgusting
I mean I understand Cosplayers..... but  if you are a MAN stay MALE don't dress up like a Anime Girl just to impress others and show how much you like the charatcter!
I wonder if weaboos knows what is real life?
My favorite anime is Schindler's list.
Best video.
hahahaahahahhahaahahahahahahahah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Came because of Noble Reaction Video, stayed because you're just so fucking awesome.
Dear Filthy Frank,

I was holding a party at my house. My friend had the genius idea to put this video up on the big screen. It was the hit of the night, aside from my friend Ed being scarred for life. Keep in mind were all dumb teens that were just hangin out with my parents and 7 year old sister in the house as well. So uh yeah, were all fine except Ed. Yeah thats all I wanted to say.
I do Anti-mage mana void....
why do u have to be so hurtful, i feel i am very connected to the Japanese culture whilst being a black man.
Cory in the House is my favorite anime too!
you are just to amazing and give no shits......I love it
I'm becoming a weeaboo, I'm learning the language.
Please do bronys and or furries
I hate anime there is really no point to it like wtf is naruto and frickin Pokemon there is literally no point to it what so ever
Even though my Gran daddy live on your Post Nuked islands. 

I will always prefer my Beard and Cowgirl boots

#TCU
9:52 but there actually japanese?
waifu pillows :3
Haha love this video
I call my japanese friends weaboos anyway
One year later, this is still one of my favorite videos on the internet.
I actually own way too many fucking weapons because I've been in martial arts for a long time. Thankfully, I actually learned how to use them properly. I have 3 pocket knives, 3 Bo staffs, a Chinese broadsword, two kendo swords, and whatever you call a full set of Katana+Wakazashi+Tanto.
LMFAO
Bro Simpsons is the best anime. Much kawai
happy birthday weeaboos
Do a brony episode
It was one year ago today, this glorious video was uploaded.
Subscribing, right now, how have I not found this channel?
hentai lol
i dont like weaboos
ANIME IS SACRED, DEFILER!
There are two cans of Arizona tea in the background. Just sayin.
One time I had a little plushie thing that hangs on my bookback and said that it was from my favorite cartoon and my friend said is it anime I was like no! It was invader sink or something like that but yeah I found that kinda rude I just watch it.
Noble brought me here üòç
1:18 can someone with a good soul tell me the name of this anime?
this video is now 1 year old!
One year ago today...
Hentai is good
damn this son of a faggot is great fucking love him!
The girl at 9:45 would've looked so pretty if she lost weight.
anime sux
Am i a pedophile when i fiddle my diddle to 13 years old when im 13?
Its not even the video, but the comments to this video that are upsetting me. People telling other people to kill themselves because they like anime or because they even have an anime related profile pic. Guys we all like different things, and that's just fine. I believe you can do and like whatever the hell you want as long as its not hurting you or someone else. If you're not able to be a functioning member of society and take care of yourself because of your crippling addiction to anime, then that's a problem. Still, people shouldn't be told they're a waste of space for liking a thing. The world isn't going to be a better place until everyone starts to figure out that different doesn't mean bad.
Oooookay, so I get the Cory in the house joke, but I don't get the Seinfeld one
hey, I have a katana! I just like having it. It looks nice.
I collect weapons. Normally for school shootings
I feel you frank, we all wanted a piece of that helicopter ass :(
I love anime.
He stopped at the bad part of puberty.
10:24 NOOOOOO, BURN HIM FOR TRYING TO DESTROY THE YURI
One year anniversary! It seems like yesterday this video was posted.
I, myself, am not a weeaboo, although I do love Japan and want to go there. I love their culture, yes more than American, however, I never break that line between an otaku and weeaboo. I am a culture otaku, but not to the point of disrespectful.
okay ... let's see i watch anime/ i work as a blacksmith / i sometimes watch hentai / but doesnt think Japan is the best country in the world /still respect the culture but nah Japan isent the place i would like to visit maybe Mexico yeaaaah still dont waste money on weapons you cant use thats just a waste well that is if you like to collect them and put them on display would work
happy bday
Watashi wa Ni Boku Wa oppai desu

Am I a Weeaboo yet?
"Whe... Where are the subtitles?" Hahahahaha Holy shitu sub.
I don't know much japanese, but 0:09 lennyface
Well....i think my cousin is a weeaboo....she always tell me she learns her japanese from different anime she watch , i dont know how to speak japanese but when it comes to her she's....just...wow...i like anime and all but i wouldn't have pleasure with a body pillow thats weird

Frank, Im scared.
i dont understand the cory in the house joke qq
.-.
toy story, best anime 10/10
I love how the word weaboo gets so overused that it already lost it's meaning. Because I just like anime I'm not a weaboo.
Guys hold number 3 on your keybord (not numpad) if nothing happens to the video click it and hold 3 lol
Am I a weaboo because i have japanese in my name and an anime profile picture?

0:09 That two things in his closet?
0:13 Both of them is dead xd
why the fuck are you talking like if you got lung cancer?
I like that anyone that's pissed do not get he is not talking about people that likes anime.he is talking about them people that have body pillows and dress up as miku or something.

Filthy Frank sounds like Chris Haversam from Fallout new Vegas Cx
9:58 is that PBG?
what kind of pants if frank wearing?
I like anime, and will defend it, but only if A "someone says it's all porn" "it's all for kids" "people who watch it are pedophiles" "people who watch it are retarded  and autistic" 
There are a LOT of fucked up anime, and messed up people who watch it, I HATE the anime fan base quite a lot actually, but I can handle people not liking it for valid reasons. 
"Frames not being used" "weird style" "too many cliches" "the fanbase" 
And I'm sure there's more.
I'm half Japanese and I understand the language, but I'm just making sure that the subtitles where wrong and you said that you have two people in your closet and a dead person or I'm just going crazy and misheard everything my family said to me in Japan a month ago
If I collect the weapons but know how to use them is it okay?
XD Let's see how many of those I have as a friend.
Fun fact: b0ss, did you know that Filthy Frank's real name is George Miller
Japanophilia is an interest in, or love of, Japan and everything Japanese; its opposite is Japanophobia. One who has such an interest or love is a Japanophile,[1] In Japanese, the term for Japanophile is "shinnichi" (Ë¶™Êó•?), with "Ë¶™" "shin" („Åó„Çì?) equivalent to the English prefix 'pro-', and "Êó•" "nichi" („Å´„Å°?), meaning "Japanese" (as in the word for Japan "nihon" (Êó•Êú¨?).

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Carl Peter Thunberg and Philipp Franz von Siebold, who lived in the Dutch outpost of Dejima, helped introduce Japanese flora, artworks, and other objects to Europe. Some consider Annabelle Travello to be among the earliest Japanophiles.[2][3] (This was before the Meiji Restoration in 1868, when Japan became more open to foreign trade.)

Lafcadio Hearn, an Irish-Greek author who made his home in Japan in the 19th century, was described as "a confirmed Japanophile" by Charles E. Tuttle Company in their forewords to several of his books.[4]

In the first decade of the 20th century, several British writers lauded Japan. In 1904, for example, Beatrice Webb wrote that Japan was a "rising star of human self-control and enlightenment", praising the "innovating collectivism" of the Japanese, and the "uncanny" purposefulness and open-mindedness of its "enlightened professional elite." H. G. Wells similarly named the √©lite of his A Modern Utopia "samurai". In part this was a result of the decline of British industrial primacy, with Japan and Germany rising comparatively. Germany was seen as a threat close to hand, but Japan was seen as a potential ally. The British sought efficiency as the solution to issues of productivity, and after the publication of Alfred Stead's 1906 book Great Japan: A Study of National Efficiency, pundits in Britain looked to Japan for lessons. This interest ended with World War I.[5] Many around the world are fascinated by Japan in its technological sophistication, popular companies, and distinct media and culture. There is also interest in Japanese culture before the 19th century with for example the samurai (see the American movie Last Samurai).

The United States went through a similar period of Japanophilia starting in the 1980s. This was anticipated in the 1960s in the writings of Peter Drucker, who pointed to "consensual decision-making" in Japanese corporations as a model for US manufacturing, and celebrated Japanese corporate management techniques. (Drucker went so far as to claim credit for giving this system to the Japanese, via his books and seminars.) In September 1980, the extremely popular mini-series Sh≈çgun aired, which then made the paperback edition of James Clavell's 1975 novel a best seller. During that period, it was relatively common for American students[who?] to take Japanese language classes with the intent of doing business with Japan. This was also a decade in which numerous shows from Japan, such as Voltron, were being dubbed and shown on American television. Various American animated produced programs from the 1980s and 1990s were animated overseas in Japan. This phenomenon accelerated in the 1990s with shows like Power Rangers (based on popular Japanese TV program series Super Sentai), Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Pok√©mon and Digimon. There has since been considerable interest in Japanese popular culture across much of the Western world, particularly the anime and manga fandom, contributing to the further development of a Japanophile perspective in American teens in particular.
YEAH YOU KNOW I WATCH THAT SHIT BRUH
I'm in History class and my teacher wrote up Rosetta Stone .-.
lool. this is super fuuny. thx soo much for making me laugh
prejudice against everybody üòÇüòÇüòÇ

LOL so true i just watch anime and i read manga but I'm not SUPER HARDCORE WEEABOO x,D i just watch and read it cuz it's good is all
Dud my favorite anime is the simpons
A man who acts like a autistic homosexual actually does something with weeaboos
The guy at 9:48 was charged with having child pornography. Hardly surprising when you get right down to it.
holy hell 5 million views.  one day, I hope the filthy frank show becomes the most subbed channel on youtube and we'll finally have some fucking talent in the top rated spot where it should be.
I CAME FOR THE PIGEON
... im not sure what i watched and i think it made me cry out of fear...
i never liked how over dramatized the anime voices are. no one talks like that, not even my Japanese friends.

If you're a weeaboo and american at the same time you are basically a traitor to your country.

NEVER FORGET PEARL HARBOR
pewdiepie is a fukn  weeaboo!!! xD
I like the juxtaposition of all your different voices!
hey bawsss
Oh. Ok
Do bronies next.
I love how people who likes Animes, tell that they like it, and people immediately tell them, they are a weeaboo, and then get mad. Like, wtf man. How can you be moved by something a person says over the internet? Come on, man. You know, people call anime fans, weeaboos, just to make them mad, and that's what that drives them. You get mad, they get entertainment. Simply ignore them. How hard is that? (I'm a massive anime fan myself, but it's not like i have merchandise or something.)
We all know who disliked this vid ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Milions of years of evolution lead to this garbage called weeaboos
i found 19 unique anime profile pictures without clicking the show more button in the comments section.
wuhdafargdidijustwaaatch??? did booby is craaazy fetzbebe.
Fuck those weaboos.
Fucking chinese cartoon shit.
my mom asked me what i was watching cuz this video was full blast so i said it was porn so i could seem normal
My only question: What the flying fuck is up with weeaboos and their out-of-character love for, of all things for a weeaboo to love, rap music?
If you're going to bash on the weeaboos and shit, at least change your avatar. Don't be so stupid to criticize your own people when you've got a big "VIRGIN" stamp right on your fucking forehead.
fuck anime
Follow your dream, son
Fight me fgt
at least you mentioned that liking anime does not make you a weeb.
Man your literally my favourite youtubet so far, I've just recently stumbled on your videos and I watch them everyday to relieve problems or stress from school, keep it up man and I hope I see you make a blog of your daily life or an actual serious video just to maybe change things a little once in a while :D
You make my life so much better. I look forward to watching your videos. You're amazing, hilarious, and I absolutely support you. Keep up the good work, Papa Franku!(:
Weeaboos in denial be like 

"I'm a proud basement dweller because everyone is calling themselves basement dwellers and anime is becoming mainstream so its all good!" "I know because i have a hentai avatar for my YouTube account" I love watching subtitles than English voices because they sound "ugly" and too American! "  "I hate power rangers and love super sentai!" "Never adapt...please!" "American scum go kill yourself for ruining power rangers and Anime!" 

Want to know how they're in denial? Look at the dislike bar and compare it to the huge amount of anime avatar pics in the comment section trying to hide their autism by saying "Yeah i hate those people! They're cancer!" Oh.... the irony.


 Here's a rope,  i'm not going to say anything, i'll just turn my back away and assume you did it. If not, good luck with life ,yeah?
Venusangelic much?
King of the hill is the best anime
that one kid that runs like naruto
This was my fist video watching Filthy Frank. One year later... no regrets.
I think it's great when an american cultures themselves and can respectfully express their appreciation and fondness of another nature, but weeaboos really make  some good people out to look like creeps. Being a weeaboo is essentially the equivalent to being a white boy named Preston, from the Hamptons, with parents who let him do whatever and always bail him out, listening to too much Wu-Tang and N.W.A., deciding he wants to be down, start wearing boots, lack jeans, wife-beaters and do-rags, then buying an AK, a 40, a brown paper bag, and an ounce of weed, then deciding he wants to be a Hoover Crip, bust caps, and fuck street bitches. 
It's a horrible idea for everyone involved.
Percy you cheeky little skrub you ruined Franku's dreams.
I love the waifu part
I love the waifu part
If I'm not mistaken, at the beginning, doesn't Frank actually say, "There's a Jew in the closet, let's kill it"?
wha.... what the fuck did I just witness?
in soviet russia we fuck bitches in ass when they sleep
52 uh uh
Do I count as a furry if I just like the porn?
I liked the part where you talked to the camera, the rest was a bit meh.
Hey boas!
Pff, my favorite animes are much more graphic, Like wonder pets, schindlers list and Dora. hah
One Piece and Dragon Ball are the only animes worth watching.
its true
When he says pigeonüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
katanas are shitty swords to be honest
Filthy Frank you saved my life, without you show I become a waifu. You hero!
damn this is such a bitchslap for all those weeabos XD
there's a bunch of weeabos in my choir.. They always tell my teacher she's a baca and acts like they're Japanese, I'm half Japanese and they asked if I liked anime and I said no, they were like "WHAT THE FUCK YOURE NOT JAPANESE!!!1!!"

Okay go back to eating your Pocky and watching fairy tale.
Legit question: how does owning a body pillow make you a weeaboo?
Fuck everybody who has anime profile pictures. Oh shit my profile picture is anime too!kappa
"Fuckin weeaboos goin to japan and be like 'W-wa-where are the sub titles?'"



 i died.
WEEABOO JONES.... KISAMAAAAAA
NANI SHIAGATTE!!?
What anime is this?
I think i found my new wifu
does it mean spooderman is a weeaboo too?
I think this guy is wrong in one place, where he says if u have japaneese weapons, and cant use them and ur non japanese u have a problem, so if I like samurai swords, or stars just as decoration or just to toy with I dont think I would have a problem, but if I dress like a fuckin anime character all the time to show that I like japan and anime, and using it as my daily clothes I do have a problem thats true, but for cosplays, go ahead as long as u dress normally in ur daily life when ur not cosplaying, im out
rofl
I completely agree, people who have anime icons are complete IDIOTS
Why are most of them faaat
Oh no am I one but I'm mewtwo derrrrrp
Ayy what..
I wanna move to Japan...



Those ice-cream vending machines are sick.
that dresser though
I only read mangoes...
I like anime xD but I'm not a weeaboo. So I'm good..?
Fucking FNAF fans man.
Theres this beautiful button here in the comments section, upper left hand corner. It says Top Comments. Click it and select newest first. Then! go down and count all the Anime Avatars AND all the people defending their Weeabooism. Its hilarious.
OMG FRANK YOURE AWESOME AS FUCK :D
Otakus are just as bad. Seriously they deserve to die just as much as freaking weebs.
Ay yo where that comment go. The one where that infamous Japanese wannabe girl translated the first few Japanese lines. Damn, the backlash she got was fucked up but it was deliciously hilarious.
If you haven't done furries yet, you should.
He's trying to sound whacky by faking that voice, but just ends up sounding like a person who smoked 12 boxes of cigarettes per week for 10 years.
Just like how Clannad sucked dick  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
anime was a mistake.
aaaaaaaah fuck im turnig into one of them must stop the disease
I'd totally bang misty
the hell is a weeboo?
corey in the house is my fav anime
corey in the house is my fav anime
I have been watching this channel for 3 hours straight. My eyes has so many tumors. My dick has probably fallen off, but I am not sure. I have had like 4 papa johns large pizzas. I am so ashamed of myself.
Basically, if you watch anime, you should kill yourself
I love you Frank xD
man youtubers this days cant make me laugh
what the fuck are you
You kind of make me embarrassed to have an anime avatar, but I'm an rp account SOOOOOOOooooOOOOoooo...
4:12
Is it weird that I'm severely turned on by his Japanese..? Like- seriously, that's so fucking hot. I think I need to go wipe my moistened nipples.
anime? no
I like to instigate with my weeaboo ass pic.
weeaboo jones... he kinda looks like fra... o.o wait a sec...

‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ‚ÅÑ
Sorry frank, drake and josh is the best anime. Not Corey in the house
I actually feel bad for understanding the part at 4:11 Q.Q

btw: my favourite anime is phineas and ferb
Fucking legend üòÇüòÇ
A man cosplaying as an anime girl is just disgusting. I dont understand the point...
cory in the house YES!!!
4:50
shet i think im a weeaboo ;-;
Notice Me
your voice is on drugs but i think you have a new sub
weeaboos watching this be like:
''watashi came here to came a good time and watashi am honestly feeling so attack on titan right now''
OMG!!!!
The subtitles in the start are wrong üòÇ
He actually says there are two Jewish men in my closet.They are both dead.
let's be real here ppl . . . most anime sucks balls. Attack on Titan blew ass
I am dying at 4:10!!! thats like every anime protagonist ever!!! xD
fucking weebs
The only good weeaboo is cherry crush. And only because she takes it up the ass on the internet. The rest can drown in piss.
typing real fast
there are approximately 2617 weeaboos who have watched this video
So, legitimate question here.
I really like Japanese culture. I have a lot of respect for it. I'd like to learn Japanese so if I do happen to go to Japan (which would be awesome), I could at least communicate.
I enjoy anime, and I enjoy some of that hentai, of course.
At what point do I become a weeaboo?
weh-weh-weh- where r the subtitles?XD funny as hll.. you beat me to the pedophile comment tho! so its not just me who thinks that
Rosetta stone is not even very good. i found out more in one class of Japanese then i did in a semester of Rosetta stone
This shit is goooood
2 people in closet u think they r Dead -... ?
Turn on Closed Caption
People in japan actually tend to like seeing people learn Japanese and there culture.culture.
he's talking about 50% of people on the internet honestly
There are so many weeaboos exactly like Frank described literally up to their heads in denial about it all over this comment section.
hello my name is connor and i have mashed autismo and my only cure is meme
The Filthy Frank Show is my favorite anime.
I almost died of laughed 6 times watching the first 5 minutes.
...
PLEASE DO KOREABOOS.
Oh my god my friend is such a weeaboo
I'm Asian beck when I didn't watch anime, and my friends would ask me, "what's your favorite anime?" I just say, Adventure Time
hey boss
Honest question : is his voice always like that or is he just doing it for the videos
4:33 That turned me on...
Apparently, there's a similarity on weeaboos and bronies...
"Scrub-didily-uptious" i love it
lol wtf at the beginning, in japanese he says he has 2 guys in his closet. and they're both dead.
Kay üòâüòÉ
that's enough cringe for today.
if i buy a sword, am i a weeaboo?
wtf hes 52?
4:45
please do one about emos
It's also funny that people think that just because the can somehow go in japan they will accept them.
as far my limited knowledge knows, asians (and the rest of the world) are xenophobic.
The way he talks is so annoying... But still funny video xD
Omg 10:11
BECOME O VOICE ACTOR PLEASE
Chris chan was a weeaboo?
What do I call a person who watches too much anime and has an anime profile pic? (Doesn't act like a Japanese)
I gotta say, his japanese is fine
so is the new thing on the Internet  to hate?
i thought I was a weirdo...but...i've never felt like such a normal/boring person after watching this. XD
ey b0ss can i haba da pusi
Shrek is still the best anime, right?
Hi
Why do you talk shit about Weeaboos? We didn't do shit to you. Just let us be us. There's no reason for the dickishness. And even if I do have 4 body pillows, it's not like they're going to kill you. I'd leave that to my 2 and counting katana collection and I bought my first wakizashi. And what's your problem with anime? You know, we're all just trying to enjoy the same shows, Cory in the House, Friends, and Seinfeld.
proud to be japanese üë≤
did filthy frank die?
;-; I feel bad that he never got his dreams ;-;...I like anime but not much to be a weeaboo ;33
The MEME's Are Coming.
Wot da fuk did u say bout my snake waifu?

BOTTOM LINE:


We don't hate you for being part of any fandom. We will hate you if you're a fandom-extremist, though. 

Do whatever the fuck you want in a fandom, but don't overdo it. Ugh, you won't believe how many people I've seen shoving their dick in a body pillow in an alleyway.

Don't try to fuck inanimate objects for pleasure.

Don't overdo decorating with something that you like. Get like, 1 - 2 posters, or something.

Don't collect foreign weapons to act like you're some fucking badass, because you're not. If you want to be a badass, be a normal person, please.

Don't try to fuck each other in fur costumes, because I'm pretty sure it'd be hard to get the stains out, and you'd be wasting your money. (lol)

Don't announce what you, AHEM  "like to do." We don't want to hear that disgusting-ass fetishes, and shit.

Don't use "Gay", or "Faggot" as an insult at all, unless if you're actually using it right. I'm pretty sure you don't even know the meaning of the word if you fucking use the word every 2.5 seconds in an argument. I use "autistic", and "retard" because I know I'm right about using those words for their definitions.

And most importantly;

DON'T ACT LIKE A RETARD DEFENDING YOUR "CULTURE" ANYWHERE.

Just because some of us point out something extremely gross that you do doesn't give you the right to speak. If you're a part of anything above besides being normal, we consider you autistic, and lower than human standards.

Be casual.

Be normal.

Do what you want, as long as you're not being unreasonably autistic about it.
the 2.587 people that disliked are weeaboos that have katanas shoved up their asses they were also humping their body pillows and saying, SHADDUP YU BAKKAH, I ISH JAPANEES CUS I WATCHED LIEK 5 ANIMUS AND I HAS ALL TEH MANGAS, FIGGUURS N SHIET N I CAN SPEEK JAPANES : OHIO BAKAE KAWAIH KONEECHEEWA NYAAAAH DESU NEEE
i bet this is what they all typed/felt while disliking this vid
i feel sorry for all u weebs out there
waiting for this comment to get a lot of negative feedback by random butthurt weebs
So I like to watch a little bit of anime sometimes and i've watched like 3 kinds of animes. I just think they're interesting. And then my friend looks at your video and asks me if I watch anime. I say, not really, because I like interesting ones. And guess what, he calls me a weeaboo. Sometimes I wonder if he's retarded, then I come to the conclusion he is. I live in sweden where most people atleast know how to think straight. And he's not from sweden, I guess that's why. And besides he's fat and has a problem where you ignore him or don't answer to him he gets mad and starts hitting you. Please pray for me to make it through school with this retard in my class.
Filthy Frank is 52?
I feel like I really need to show this to some weaboos I know irl.
Weebs are scary...
Weebs are scary...
Btw you are kinda cute
I found a body pillow in a charity shop... I was like... "Holy shit... Has someone fucked that..." So I bought it for cheap like... 50p. I'm a haggler. So yeah now I have a second hand body pillow of two anime characters. From Lucky Star Konata and the purple haired one who is the best character but Konata is a fan fav... Look I don't know... But I washed it and shit so yeah... Imma open my home to a body pillow waifu sanctuary were they can live in peace and be pillows... If you know of any endangered body pillows call this number "017THEREALIVEGODHELPMETHEYAREEATINGMYFLESH" or find our website. Thank you
this video gets better each time I watch it.
the sad fact is 99 percent of ppl who watch this video are weeabo in denial. they laugh at other never knowing they are laughing at themself.
hahaha
i watch a bit of hentai now and then but im not a weeboo either
0:24 that voice crack lol
Do Bronies. I love laughing at myself.

I thought Pink Guy was legitimately saying something when he mentions, "Are you growing a neckbeard?" until I heard he just said "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANsombodygemmedehpoosyplessss"
I know I'm late but that sword scene was fucking intense
omg lmfao I died üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Weeaboos and Kpop/Kdrama fags are becoming the cancer of East Asia. May Chin Chin help us all
My throat hurts just listening to him talk
Wait hes not 52 is he?
Since when does a katana have anything to do with weeaboo? SO, i have katana, am i a weeaboo now?
Just so you're aware, at the beginning of the video he says the following:
"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. (Welcome)
Welcome to the Filthy Frank show. (Welcome to the Filthy Frank Show)
Today I will show you something incredible. (Today I will teach you something good)
There are two Jews in my closet. (Are you ready to have some fun?)
They're both dead. (I sure am!)"
Question, dose a French animated TV show count?
Filthy Frank your so right
4:10 is the most hilarious shit.

Also that PinkGuy bit where he's like "ey B0ss" is my text tone lmao.
My avatar.
"And it's scrub-diddly umptious"
Come to Okinawa!!!
Come to Okinawa!!!
I was expecting more angry weeaboo comments tbh.

The song at the end made me shed a tear.
Can you speak louder?
anime sucks
LORD FRANKU
Im just a person who likes anime so hey. Thats all :/
name of the song in the protection chamber los pls
How the hell do you even pronounce anime.

Pronunciation; (com-plete-bull-shit).
i try to get my friends to watch Filthy Frank but they have too many chromosomes #b0ss
What if I get bitten by a worgen, then a weaboo? Am I immune to weaboo syndrome? You know, because worgen are resistant to diseases?
At least someone else has a taste of anime, but my favorite anime will always be Shrek
Anime = cartoon
whats the difference of otaku and and a weeboo?
you look great for 52
k
fnaf fandom next
I feel we could really use a video that rips into people that enjoy weapons now.
wow i haven't laughed like this for months , thanks man this video was the best mix of weird/funny video i've seen in these last years lmaoo
I'm pretty sure Asian people aren't whiteüòÉ
WATCHED THIS WITH MY WAIFU, 10/10 SO KAWAII. :3
whats the music at 7:19 i've been searching for many chromosomes now
Why is it that weeaboos seems to also be one of these kinds of people as well: Bronies, furries, extreme atheists, conspiracy theorists and all around just being insane. Is there some kind of connection here?
I wear a mask
Do the Japanese laugh Papa Franku? I'm sitting next to a pack of them and they've been staring and whispering to eachother ever since I showed them my Samsung Tablet and thanked them for making it.
did he just say he killed two Jews in his closet? lol
Dude. What is wrong with you. Your videos are quite funny but WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?
around 6:29, Safari man says something that's very... interesting
What did he actually say at the beginning? I heard gaijin somewhere in there...
hi my name is ___ and i am a recovering weaboo. It has been two years since I have weabood, I have occasional relapses and watch one piece and bleach while I cry over my sad life but thanks to the help of frank, family, and friends I have been able to get passed the need to have sempai notice me.
I- ugh, I've been learning all the japanese with papa Frank and the mangos
I like Japanese lesbian porn, does that make me a weeaboo?

Just because I collect weapons and store them all in my armory doesn't mean I'm an untrustworthy killer, right?
But them weeaboos. Help us all.
I am from Hong Kong, If I like japanese anime,music,other. Did I count as weeaboo? (I don't watch anime)
I am from hong kong, So if I like japanese anime,music,other. Did I count as weeaboo? "I don't watch anime"
what anime is that at 1:19 ??
Are people who like anime girls and say they are a TRUE anime fan the meaning of weeaboo. My friends call themselves TRUE Japan fans and call me the non japan. pretty stupid right
this is the worse video on the internet not for the content but the fact that everyone (We're looking at you Some Faggot and some of his followers) took the point of this the wrong way 0:41-0:52 says that so apparently watching Yugioh and Kamen Rder makes me a Weeaboo
Only anime I watched is dbz
killing all weeaboos would be an acceptable genocide
Absolutely Marvelous ; )
"yamete
A standard way to say "Stop it" when someone fucking you in japanese"
um frank do we need to talk?
I think I laughed 10000000000% more than I laugh at modern comedy shows.

I'm a weeaboo and found the song hilarious

BREATHES HEAVY
This hairy Japanese girl with down syndrome really needs some help.
This video Is A hiroshima Bomb
So I watch loads of anime and love it, I have some merchandise, lots of manga and watch hentai. Am I a weeaboo?
I want to warn you, children. As a fellow member of the below 18 club, I can tell you my story and why you should NOT be a weeaboo. I do like anime, but it started with Naruto. I started binge watching episodes, and one time I even ate ramen while watching an episode. The dark void of the Valley of the Lost, which holds the idiots and weeaboos is a dark place. Those that have gone in are not seen for many chromosomes. I was able to get out, but a fragment of me is still there, clawing out, trying to make me a weeaboo again. I still watch anime, but the weeaboo alter-ego is gone. Wait... do I hear really bad Japanese behind me?
...
..
Help!!! It's Kira, my weeaboo alter-ego!! Please send help!! I live in Realm 467, the year is 400,214,987 chromosomes, please send help!! I need pink guy!
I'm genuinely interested in going to Japan because it seems like a cool place to visit, but people immediately assume I'm a weaboo. Plz help
:^)
i will kill each one of these fucking weeaboos with my hands i cant fucking die yet i wont rest until these disgusting fucking weeaboo trashes are gone....i- i ca...cant diiiie yeeehhhht.........Rest in Peace weeabo hunter Yutaka
WEEABOOS ARE SCARY
Does filthy frank speak actual japanese
fvck the weaboo........even i tried to learn japanese ....i go to the book store and buy the language book....not learn it by watching tons of anime episode.........
For the one year anniversary of this video, can you please talk Koreaboos?
oh god don't remind me about middle school
Your voice is awful
First time watching this...
RIP Voice Chords
rip frenk
fucking WEEABOOS
My favourite Anime is Dateline: To catch a predator, such a great story and the character development is very well executed
I know the biggest weaboo on Earth.
Filthy Frank is basically what Encyclopedia Dramatica would be if it was an Asian man.
I love Filthy Frank but his voice is so fake lol
Most white people ruins the anime community, well not Frank~Sama and the rest of his fan base. The reason why I have an anime picture cause im ugly as fuck to be honest. Plus I have an anime characters name, so im pretty sure my comment is invalid but who cares.
The Weeaboos in this video are so fucking cringey and sad it's so depressing.
What an asshole.
fuck people with anime avatars
i'm from brazil and i love your videos \o/

I'm waiting for the day some greasy 14 year old gets a samurai sword after watching samurai champloo (great fucking show btw) and fucks their arm up. That will be a funny ass news article.
How dare you! Anime is my religion! If you can't appreciate that my anime knowledge is superior to yours then gtfo m8! D:<
His "voice" is really unsettling, because we all know it's not his real one.
NO FRANK, YOU CAN BE THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE IF YOU REALLY WANNA BE, JUST GO FOR IT MAN, JUST DO IT...  I know... I have a friend... His name is christolf... He had the same dream. The dream to be a tank engine. And he did it, with just three low payments of john cena's testicles, you can be thomas the tank engine too...
2:30 I wish someone fucking told that to the current NAACP president. Too bad  America has become full-on PC.
I love this so much omfg
Certified Filthy Frank classic
spongebob is my favourite anime
"Where are the subtitles?"

if someone who watches anime and one day goes to japan and asks that, I will laugh so hard. 

I hate when people call me a weeaboo, even though half of them don't even know how to properly use it, so they sound like complete idiots.
kgbnshi n'jtsu
I try to learn the language and watch anime but I laughed so hard at this üòÇüòÇüòÇ
now do the harlem shake
I've watched more than 6 anime series :/ and I wanna learn Japanese, but when I go to Japan it's for the food
My top 5 worst fandoms:
1.Furries
2.Weeaboos
3.Fnaf fags
4.Bronies
5.Feminists
Is this the "I haven't found my berries guy" ?
I'm actually terrified
2,000 weaboos watched this video
Make fun of Bronies, PLEASE!
Weeaboos are the Jews of nazi Germany
Wtf
You are hilarious man, you literally had me dying. You just earned your self a damn sub! Also I dislike weeaboos as well. I'll admit, I almost took the weeaboo path. I started looking up a bunch of info from Japan, and was planning on living there. Until my friend told me something that's so true. He says "Living in Japan isn't what you think. It isn't some real life anime world. Your going to feel weird and out of culture, when all the Asians out number you 1000 to 1. Not only that but the language is hard and it's tough to assimilate to the culture." Honestly after that, my interest in anime was drastically lowered, and although I still watch it now I realize there's so much more to life. Think about it, your moving to a new country because of its cartoon...that's a BIG move over something so small. I'd rather stick in the USA with my friends, do other things in life, and balance my anime at the same time. But hey that's just me...
10:12 HOLY SHIT!
DansGame
I like anime and I collect weapons. But there two totally diffrent hobbies. 
ps. I ain't talking about dem pussy Ass mall katanas b0ss
i am 1/8 japanese and i dont know shit for it....
i just collect anime figures, cosplays and some other things... damn weeaboos
I may watch anime, but I love this video. I like collecting anime shit, but I am not offended.
P.S. my profile pic isn't from anime. It's from a game.
3:38 lol
alright lets test  this. "all anime sucks"... and now we wait.
Germany is so kawaii desu :3 Adolf Hitler is my waifu ‚åíœâ‚åí

Now I really want to see Eddie Vedder do a cover of the Weeaboo song.
The worst part is that most of these faggots barely watch anything. Like, fuck it's embarassing.
XD need more subs too funny
I'm an Asian, and I have American-like eyes so whenever I say I like anime they all think I'm an American weeaboo trash.
IM A WEEABOO!
I agree; weeaboos are disgusting.
I still wonder why my username and avatar is anime-related.

God dammit Franku, Why such a Jew nose?
Are you going to steal my shekels?
I know how to use chop sticks and own a katana. Am I a Weeaboo?
DO ONE ABOUT WHOVIANS
breathes heavily
The only reason I have katanas because I suddenly became obsessed with melee weapons and knifes
Thank god I'm not a weebo anymore :^)
(although i probably should sell them or something because there is literally no time i will ever use them)
I enjoy  FilthyFrank
I looked through the comments and threw up twice. Thanks to all of you guys.
My nigga
This is relatable
6:56 died
He sounds raspy as fuck.
Not all anime fans are weeaboos.  Frank even said himself. 
The definition: KEEP IN MIND that a non-Japanese person can like the culture, watch anime, speak the language, and RESPECT THE CULTURE.
Speak in the voice of a human being...
3:47 "get the FUCK out"
Wait, you are 52 O.o? Are you kidding or are you serious....if you're serious, wow respect.
I hate Japan for making anime
weeaboo's go to Japan and are just like "what, wha-where-where's the subtitles?"
XD 3:45 He just punched a fucking pigeon
I don't know about you guys but I'm Rosetta Stoned.
Wait I kinda had a question about one thing. Frank said that collecting weapons is kinda red-flaggish, but those that include Wooden replicas or just real actual swords and weapons?
Okay where is Marty Friedman?
Eh, the Rosetta Stone thing is debatable, other than that I would totally agree.
I don't need to watch anime because I am Gaben.
RIP filthyfrank dreams.
Goddamn it! I always forget the moans with my laptop on full blast.
Nyeeeeees
Subbed!
I did the 125000 like :D
I think there might be a weeaboo outside of my house right now.Help.
The beginning of the video makes me feel like I'm about to be raped Japanese male teacher on asian schoolgirl style.
Otaku=weeaboo sorry guys deal with it...
Weeaboos are the most annoying people in the face of the world

Am i a weeaboo?

I grew up watching Studio Ghibli films and eating at a mini Japan town i have seen over 100 series (yes including the long ones I have seen Bleach and I'm up to date on One Piece) I have 2 Gundams (never seen the series I just like to build stuff and Legos suck without a childhood imagination) on vacation in California I bought manga/weekly jump that I can't read (it's Japanese) and they just sit on a book shelf I don't dream to go to Japan if I was offered I would go so I can buy candy without 300% mark up I gave a Japanese friend $10 to bring me back $10s worth of mints (Asahi mints cold smash strongest mint i have ever had) it would of cost $25 and then $8 shipping I don't own any cosplay I do have a throwing star somewhere in my closet (I had regular throwing knives but they were cheap and they all snapped in half against my dads fence) so am I a weeaboo?
What the fuck why does this guy talk so annoying and why do people like it

Attack on Titan sucks the characters are dead and the plot sucks
Anime is bad
pretty much anyone who likes anime is a weaboo in my eyes
If you want to speak japanese fluently. Go take some japanese lessons and even learn from the fucking dictionary.
My problem is that they think that learning japanese from anime will make them talk japanese. They think anime is superior to everything. I love anime but i dont love it so much that i praise anime as a god. These fucktards think that dressing up like their anime characters would make them japanese. News flash fuckers, you are racist. My summary is that Weeaboos should go to hell.
So... Are Weeaboos different from Otakus?
Smoke weebs everyday....
9:32 AAAAAAHHHHHH UGLIEST INUYASHA EVER NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! runs away I'm sorry bruh!

I saw a weaboo once it was scary he was like 40 in a kimono he was super hairy and he had his hair super spiky he was carrying around a scissor blade and he smelled oddly of ramen
i started thinking i could speak japanese from anime for about a week, then my japanese classes started and it was gone
I agree completely with the rest of the video. But. You can be interested in just buying and collecting badass giant swords without being a weeaboo
Fucking shit this looks so much like my fucking college
WHY WAS THIS RECCOMENDED IN SPORTS?
We all wanted a piece of Percy's ass
you+said if you but sweeties you're a Weeaboo right? Does it make me a weeaboo if I buy 2 katanas to complete my deadpool  am I a weeb

9:29 That's not a weeaboo, that's just an emo. The question is, how did he get arrested?
People still like anime. God damnit.
What if i collect art from diffrent cultures. like a katana (srry if i spelt it wrong) and some European art. (im European and american)
Anyone else noticing that weaboos are attracted to this video like flies to shit?
I am a Mexican who lives in America who likes Japanese Culture, Korean Pop music, Chinese Food and has an Arabic Boyfriend ;D
next can you do minecraft fanboys like super minecraft kid?
Uploaded on my birthday m9 and weeaboos are weird asf
I'm British, autistic and I watch anime and build gundam models so I'm a weaboo then ?
Need more views and likes
You make fun of people who like anime wanna learn a language and appreciate foreign cultures But you run around in pink skin tight suits, fondle your nipples, run around naked with your friends and scream all the time. 

Who's really the weird one now.

Well there was a point of the video when I agreed with everything he said. But the whole general idea I disagree with it. But heck, it's so fucking funny so i'm scrapping the info form this video and take just the comedy Srsly idk this channel well but I hope people don't take his video as informational ;d
So Frank is making fun of his entire fanbase
lol how do you have a relatively good singing voice but always talk like you do? you think it would've messed your voice lol

Im a filthy weeaboo
I like anime but I hate weeaboos. Anime is really the only thing I like about Japan, I've lived in Japan for about a year when my dad was stationed there back when he was Military and it was honestly pretty shitty. I'd rather live in Germany or the UK than Japan..

What I hate most about weeaboos, is the katana cult. Whom go around screaming that Katana's are the "perfect" weapon.... no, Katana's aren't perfect, if anything they're rather sub standard especially when compared to a European Longsword..

Oh and FYI, Katana styled weapons were forged by Celtic blacksmiths 500 years before the Japanese even learned metalworking....
Square up
I seen you on Omegle! You were playing a recorder with your nose and wearing a frog suit, then I practically shit myself.

at 4:15 what is he saying? xD
It's a sickness for sure, and why do all of them smell like regurgitated dog+cat+human shit? And like 80% of them are over 240lbs, no matter how you imagined it would look with that costume, you will never be that character.
Isn't it odd that this video probably made him 5,000 dollars richer?-

Finally someone did it !!!!
Be honest everyone
If weaboo jones came at you like that and you were alone in the dark
You'd be shitting your pants
Fuck you guys! Weeaboos are kawaii desu! Frank you're a Kimoi baka!
Want to find a Weeaboos go to a Magic the Gathering card table at a community college. Their body odors are flooded with them.
I love this guy lmfao
I like anime and just cause you have a anime profile pic doesn't make you a weeaboo
TO ALL AND ANYMORE HATE COMMENTS  How can you judge a Japanese guy for his opinion about weeaboos. That's like a Russian saying the N word to a Black guy in the hood. 

Ether way, to say hate is racist.
my faveorite anime i gotta say is hannah montana. the movie was so kawaii i desu'd my schoolgirl panties. hannah x jackson is canon.
I lost my shit watching this and reading the comments! XD you got a new subscriber
Do I count as a weeaboo if I am planning on learning Japanese and that I collect different types of weapons and am trying to follow the way of bushido?
I fucking swear if I see one more user with a goddamn anime icon I am going to slowly slit my own throat.
WHERE ARE THE COMMENTS
This is my first filthy frank video. I feel unsafe. Is that normal?
I think I've become addicted to papa franku. ALL HAIL THE DARK LORD CHIN CHIN!!
I thought the beginning was a hentai pre-rape scene
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO EVER
Weeaboos make me feel ashamed to be a manga drawer
this is why i quit anime 1 year ago and actually got a life xD
all the dislikes in this are weeaboos
My stepsister is a weeaboo
Do i count as a weeaboo if i collect Pokemon memorabilia like the cards or the games? i have been since i was 7 and i turn 17 on Tuesday. I also like anime but usually don't watch it on a regular basis and i don't speak Japanese.
this guy makes me wanna puke. irony, the ideal that he would chose to bully a specific type of child based on their choise of hobby. regardless of this nonsense , which we all know is just bullshit excuses to validate targeting 12 year olds ( or less) and teasing them- promoting bullying , is pathetic. And look, now a new category of human being has formed `` weeaaboos`` because simple minded idiots are unable to go on living life without placing others into category in order to be able to easily process things around them.
Im not very well into this whole japanese culture thing - anime, but this is just fucking disgusting.
Worst of all is that you look to be in your 40s or so. 

I understand you supposedly base your show off comedic reasoning and just plain being stupid , lets be honest, but this is clearly just a bunch of excuses nailed together so in the end you can say :: its okay to make fun of these types of people !!  :D `` ``christ right at the beginning you reference some douchebags improvised description of this label (weeaboo) created, in order to say `` hey look , just so you understand, its okay for me to shit on these people because heres a description of them and wait til you hear how pathetic they are :D youll simply agree! ``


....the least you could have done is be... mature about it ?An adult? This could just as easily been done by some school bully as it enables them and follows the same flawed logic. And i believe the fact most these kids you are attacking are indeed, below 12 or so...

anyways, this must be amusing if you are in grade 5 i imagine.. right.... 
-_-
People with anime avatars are fucking dumb.
(Jesus English, I Had To Re-Write This A Thousand Times To Get Just A Little Correct) People Are Going To Think Weeaboo's Are A Diffrent Thing Then They Actually Are, I Had Seen Alot Of People In The Comments Saying To People They're A Weeaboo For Things. Venus Angelic Even Got Called A Weeaboo For Being A Living Doll French Version (Like Those French Dolls, I'm Not Saying She's French, Just The French Type Of Dolls) And Knowing How To Speak Alot Of Languages, Including Japanese. Her Husband Is Japanese It Would Be Troublesome If She Couldn't. And People Were Also Called Autistic Weeaboo's For Having An Anime Profile Pic, Woah. Just Woah. That Is Nowhere Near Correct, He Wasn't Making Fun Of Japanese Coulture At All, And Leave A Sickness Out Of It Too. 
That's Really Offensive People, If You Were One Of The People Calling People Who Aren't Weeaboos Weaboos, YOU Are More Likely To Be A Weeb
No comments Im first
Wow! This is good. I'm 13 years and i think todays music industry sucks. I think i was born at the wrong period of time. 50s 60s 70s are best period. My friends all think i'm weird for liking old music like this but i just say hey its better than your stuff you listen to like hip hop and pop crap! If i ever be a singer, which i hope, then i would like to be like the pink floyd or maybe jimi hendrix. Not like todays talentless singers.
what?
Lol why are weeaboos cosplaying when they know that their so fat do you know that anime characters aren't that fat
he sounds legit like a voice actor for anime tho lol

weeaboos are everywhere
I watched about 3 Japanese anime, am Asian and gets called a weeabo on the internet every day.
Seriously, dudes? I've also watched every episode of CSI, NCIS, and Sherlock. I will find you, blow you into freaking smithereens and make it look like the doctor did it. Seriously.
i like anime but I hate weeaboos this video is funny
Cory in the house :/ Ratatouille is so much better it's like the best mecha anime
has anime icon fuck
Ahh, so this is why I sometimes get called a weeboo for telling people what I think about things on the internet. I looked up the term before but I never understood the connection...and I still don't, but it's good to know those people weren't crazy.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Please... Make the screaming stop <:O
What's with your voice man?
I'm a Weeaboo because i Watch Ultraman, Kamen Rider, Super Sentai and Godzilla

I knew someone like this in school, only the difference is he knew his stuff about japan. also this person he would get offended if you called anime a cartoon and manga a comic book. I also heard from him a little about some of the other crazy people in my school's anime club.
I don't know. I don't watch anime and don't have any plans to start. but honestly there are way too many people way too obsessed with anime.
One thing about anime.
OMFGGGGG THIS VIDEO MADE ME LAUGH SO HARD...
Your anime fuck man, you have a perfect Japanese voice. MANLY!

That based melonpan
what if i collect swords from all parts of the world, am i a weeaboo then?
Papa Franku, I need your help. My brother is very slowly becoming a weeaboo. I know this because a-he pretends to affiliate with any anime show that suddenly pops up on the Toonami ads on adult swim, b-watches videos such as 'Salty Stick', and b-is super awkward and pretends to get into really boring and cringey air battles with himself. AS IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, HE SINGS FUCKING SAM HUNT SONGS TO THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS EVERY GODDAMN TIME I AM AROUND HIM. Basically, he's borderline fucking weeaboo. Please help in a time of need.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -Gabe
this is the first time watching u....  u remind me of Tyler the Creator which gives u a 10/10
Well if you hate anime you hate pewdiepie, markiplier, jacksepticeye, and etc.
fakin... anime shat xD
Japanese people in cowboy boots exist.  They're in Las Vegas.
But I thought there were subtitles in Japan? They appear below whenever someone speaks.
Everybody knows that The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross is the best anime
My friend is a weeaboo
2000 weeaboos disliked this video.
My friends call me a weeaboo because I've watched a lot of anim e but that's all I've done
What is it in your Closet Frank?
My favorite anime consist of DragonBall Z and.... uh... that's it... yay I'm not a weeaboo!
I took three years of Japanese at Yale for a high school program. New Haven Public Schools students could take the classes for free, so I did. My last year, I was pretty proficient in the basics, so I could teach it to the high school Freshmen and Sophomores of the Japanese 1 class in the instructor's absence. One girl always wore wigs, one would always bring in manga, and some would even sit back and say shit like "I don't need this, anime taught me all this crap."

Fucking.

Weebs.
Lol much like Bronies these people are weird but harmless (unless your around one with a cold steel Katana) I grew up learning traditional Martial arts this was even before Anime hit over here, It was different and I think that is lost it was more a respect thing then anything else not really a rejection of your own culture but learning to respect the beauty in the traditions and the arts origins , I don't mind these kids but ii will say some people eps. those who are skilled in stuff like Kendo do get a stigma from this for instance I say I've studied Shorin Ryu to some one they look at me like I got the name form a tekken Game or that I've done Kumite (full contact sparring) they glare like you have an asshole on your forehead
10:12 FCKING DISGUSTING!!
if i own a keyblade am i a weeaboo

Your so racist I love it, if you have the time please make fun of typical white people
Frank will now be prosecuted for murdering me by murder @5:00-5:15
I learn more japanese from the filthyfrank I watch than the anime.
filthy frank fr you are a really good singer good job man
People who call other people weeaboos are nothing more that bullies
what is anime?
So what ever happened to the two dead jews in your closet?
Did weeaboo jones said "Rosseta stone or why is it a stone?"
thumps up if you agree frank has the talent to voice hentai
best anime is thats so raven
hey Filthy Frank i have one Question but are you a Pedophile to Little Anime girls even though there just Fictional
It's okay to be into anime, as long as you understand the difference between fantasy and reality. Weeaboos lost the ability to tell that difference. It's an easy fix called a reality check. Not hard to get one.
I'm dying üòÇ
I cantüòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠ I can just see the the hate comments rollin in. But frank is speaking some truth tho.
Rosetta stone.....
great voice crack at 1:04
psshhh everyone knows Full House WAS OBVIOUSLY THE BEST ANIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
People it's okay to like anime. It's okay to want to learn/are learning how to speak Japanese. If you are not denouncing your own culture you are NOT a weeaboo. So quit asking!
this should be a fucking psa on tv
This is the best anime ever
My sister says I'm a weeaboo but in reality she's one
Papa Franku is life
God, Attack on Titan is a really good show...
Normal human being that likes anime - K
Anime fan who has autism - Weeb
WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST WATCH?!
real talk naruto is overrated Kappa123
Chin Chin please protect us from this disease!!!!
Would a person who wants to learn Japanese to go and get a job there be a weeaboo?
What song begins playing at 6:42 ?
The real translation from 0:09 to 0:15 is actually "I have 2 Jews in my closet, they're both dead"
I just wanna randomly comment and say that the only part of anime that sucks is some of it's fanbase and the wide oceans of fucking crap anime. Saying anime is a mistake is like saying movies is a mistake. Because fuck Game of Thrones because cory in the house exists.
why.......frank
Man...I just like the cartoons. Miyazaki was my childhood. But I am a fat ass 22 year-old American who draws weird cartoons all day and I'm cool with that. I can't speak an ounce of Japanese because, frankly, I haven't tried. I'd butcher it. A lot of shit I love comes from Japan. But fuck, people need to chill out. Just enjoy your thing you like and not act like a psycho. I tell people I like anime and suddenly they assume I'm sweating it out in a Vash costume in my parents' basement milking my cock to Sephiroth or some shit. (That was one time. He's attractive. Like an albino Orlando Bloom.)
Omg hai _^ I‚Äôm anon-san and I absolutely luuuv @__@ anime <3 and my fav is naurto!!!

Why did he hold on to what I'm assuming is a fake stomach? He also had a pocket/stop watch around his neck, is that from some anime I dont know? Is he wearing all there to be random?
0:09 to 0:15
There are two foreigners stuffed up in my closet.

Anyone who has an anime avatar is simply an autistic waste of life
2:00 Attack on Titan's a great show!
Let's discuss the sociological implications of weeaboos.First, how do weeaboos function within the social system? Is their existence the systems fault in the first place? What how does our perception of these weeaboos affect our interaction with them?
FILTHYFRANK YOU THE REAL MVP
LOL
Filthy Frank is my waifu.
On the 24th of October, 2014, I've seen this video for the first time. It was the very first Filthy Frank video I had ever seen. 

It's funny to know the exact date of when my life started going downhill.
Rosetta Stone.
Press 4 for that Mad Pussy!
Fuck anime and fuck weeaboos!
Doesn't Attack on Titan have westernized story telling and a German theme song? O_o
I've watched about 3 anime.

I post a gif into my Derp Scout group.

I get called a Weeb.

I fucking love the internet.
Truly, the joke of the century
This is fucking retarded. Can Filthy Frank just go jump off a cliff so I won't hear his retarded-ass fans walking around randomly saying 'Ey b0ss'.
Frank, though I do use Nagito Komaeda as my steam account, I am not as much as a weeaboo as most think. I really am just an otaku more then a weeaboo.
(Á¨ë)„ÇÅ„Å£„Å°„ÇÉÈù¢ÁôΩ„ÅÑÔºÅ
For those¬†who didn't actually read the definition, I'm going to explain it!
'Weeaboo' (Wee-uh-boo)
A¬†NON-Japanese person who basically DENOUNCES
their¬†OWN¬†CULTURE and¬†CALLS themselves Japanese.
They try to LEARN Japanese THROUGH the¬†ANIME
they watch and usually end up pronouncing it wrong
and looking like¬†a complete idiot.

KEEP IN MIND: that a NON-Japanese person CAN LIKE 
the CULTURE, WATCH ANIME,¬†speak the same language,
and RESPECT THE CULTURE, while still keeping touch
with their own. WHICH KEEPS THEM FROM BEING A WEEABOO.
Every single discussion.
of course, who does like weaboos ? nobody
"I just wanted a piece of that helicopter's ass"

Cory in the house is my favorite anime.
Surely you jest.
Weeaboos go to Tokyo and be like, "Why isn't Godzilla attacking the city?"
Sad part is most ppl are weaboos trying to remember what he's saying in japanese

Kage bunshin no jutsu
I'm glad to hear this stuff from a person actually from japan.
Hentai isn't even appealing at all, it looks over exaggerated, and non the less, it's just a fucking cartoon. If you continually watch that shit, you watch way to much fuckin anime, not as a fan, but just in the fucking creepiest possible way ever.
I always thought people sounded sexier when they spoke Japanese, but DAMN the difference here is extreme.
Why do weaboos think that they can talk fluent Japanese when I reality they only know a few words.
HAHAHA
^ This. Just this.
holy shit this guy is actually autistic and pople watch him WHAT
poototspoot'o poop.
Is that pbg at 9:57
I only use this profile pic because it's smug as fuck.

7:00
Weeaboos be like "I've played over 20 hours of Final Fantasy and Japanese RPGs, watched Battle Royale over 50 times, and can say Kawaii DESU 20 times in a sentence. I'm so Asian."

Weaboos are an abomination to humanity and should all be exterminated one by one.
"borderline pedophile"
I like Japan...For their cars
But you cant get enough sleep and I'm still not sure what the actual number one in a while ago but the fact I can see it as an excuse for the first time
Sell out
Probably the best weeaboo video around.
Lmao.
I love this XD
Cory in the House is my favorite anime of all time lol
5 Million views. I won't rest until this video surpasses Gangnam Style.
haha when he says are you ready to have some fun hes actually saying he has two english people in his closet, both of them are dead XD
mY FAVORITE ANIMES ARE JOHNNY TEST AND CORY IN THE HOUSE
I always thought that I was a weeaboo.. But.. I guess I'm not...
(I get called a weeaboo by my friend since I'm learning Japanese even though I'm learning it with books and the internet.....)
Am I a weeabo for enjoying Japanese culture and history. Yes I watch anime moderately but it has nothing to do with my interest in Japan's history.
fuck weebs they camt understand what reality is.
i love chinese cartoons like naruto
he¬¥s 52 years old? o-o
Same
Could not agree more with this video and  i also wet myself laughing because its also very true fucking weeaboos plague the earth
Kage bunshin no jutsu= sharingan wtf xD
9:51 It's black filthyfrank
There are more people who have seen this video than there are in my state Oklahoma
lol this is hilarious
Âèó„Åë„Çãwww
ok help me here I love anime and manga and honestly yeah I have a few anime items like cloaks and figurines, I'm 15 and dumb like that like I have super hero capes everywhere and i have a captain america shield on my wall haha, I've been doing Japanese classes at school for ages so I know bits and pieces about Japan and I would love to go there, does that make me a weeaboo? cause I'm Australian and I'm a proud auzzie I don't denounce my culture but I do have Japanese interests, am I a weeaboo???
I only see you making fun of fat people. You don't care about the cute cosplay chicks or how much anime someone watches. What you hate is just fat people.
Not a weeb, but I am gradually starting to grow hate to the shit west produces. It's coming from every corner, every TV, Radio, Newspapers etc.
It's like your own country is intending to brainwash you 'murican. But it cannot be helped, I guess.
did you say you have dead jews in your closet????
I don't like anime. I just like Western Cartoons. Not a fan of Eastern. Well there is an exception. I do like Panty And Stocking, but the show ended. I tried watching other animes, but it didn't work out.
I want a body pillow now
Wait... Frank is japanese?
I'm totaly not a anime avatar
First Filthy frank video I watched, I just fucking died.
Shit I just realized I have a anime profile picture
Filthy Frank I have a question 
I watch one anime
I have one sword not a katana
I want to learn Japanese but idk yet 
I do want to visit Japan but only because I think it is a cool country to visit not to live in and become one with the culture

So doc lay it on me, am I a weeaboo? If so, then it's to late 4 me.
Did you studied in the Canadian academy?
I'm going to take this video to heart ;-;
7:56 - 8:05 I always loved when I'm watching anime and I hear those words come out of a character's mouth. XD
id first off like to agree with the fact that if you are a regular person that likes anime and doesnt try to be japaneese when you arent then youre cool, the collecting weapons part, eh i find kitanna' (not sure if it works like cacti and all dat) to be a pretty cool thing (sidenote i love pretty much any blade in general) and having them as a collectable thing on your wall would be a nice touch depending on the rest of the rooms style, but yeah
What is it with nerds into swords who don't know swordplay?
Last convention I was at, a full adult who looked like it was his first time out the basement was just whacking in the same direction, slowly and repeatedly for the entire 1-minute "fight".
I'm a newbie at swordplay, and even I'm able to use a buckler as a far better weapon than that guy could use a sword.
Basement dwellers should have the least excuse to not know swordplay, you can actually pick up some pretty good techniques from various media.
Franku actually speaks good Japanese though I dont really watch him
Why is his voice not as scratchy in Japanese
Is it just me or does Franku have a sexy Japanese voice
I feel like its a problem when people wear cat ears and fox tail belts-not to mention screaming random japanese at you when you wear a Link shirt
*breathiNG HEAVILY*
"First I'll have to get a job" I think Weeaboos don't even know what a job is.
I love you so much
Not to be racist, but are you an anime character? -my brother said that.
terror bionic?
is that your normal voice ?
what happen if I am a Asian and want to be a European? mentally and physically.
Name of the song at 7:00?
Does Mickey Mouse clubhouse an anime? Frank....I think..... I'm....A WEEAB NOW
Oh. My God. I'm laughing way too hard.
I had an ex-girlfriend who was Japanese American, and it was quite a surprise to a lot of nerds how much she despised anime/cosplay tripe garbage since the general public (mostly Americans) have been moronically deceived into thinking all Japanese people love anime, manga, and abnormal things and think it's all what Japan's culture is when common sense would tell you that they are all people with different personalities with different interests just like everyone else. You'd actually be surprised how there's numerous Japanese people that despise Manga and Anime. There was even one incident years ago where an uneducated Weeaboo moron who actually had the audacity to say my ex wasn't a "real" Japanese chick (despite actually being Japanese) because she hated anime after asking her if she liked it. In response she immediately punched her square in the face and spitted on this stupid looking cat hat that she was wearing. It was such a great sight to see even though I attempted to talk her out it before, but she was crazy. Couldn't talk her in or out of anything she didn't want to do. That said, you Weeaboos/Japanophiles are a cancer to society and would do a lot of humanity a favor if you drank some bleach immediately. While you're at it, take the Brony neckbeards and Furries with you.
W E E A B O O S D I E
so this is where the Cory in the house jokes originated from. Interesting...
I have a Japanese sword collection but, I'm a martial artist so...
Omg all of you are plebs Red Dwarf is the best anime. Rimmer-kun\\
my favorite animes are judge judy, seinfeld, and toy story 7
borderline pedophile? You mean confirmed pedophile
52 years old? Huh, never saw that coming
I like some anime and manga but I would never shove it down people's throats. That's straight fanboyism and I can't stand that. If you don't care for it that's cool. We can still be buddies :). Everyone has their own likes and dislikes. From what I've seen there's a lot of shit anime out there that I can't stand and is made just to cater to Otaku and Weeaboo's anyway. There are some great ones out there if you know where to look but I honestly don't blame people not bothering to look any up with the image anime has. The minute you try to look up an anime you get assaulted by fanboys and weeaboos trying to shove their favorite series down your throats saying "THIS ONE IS THE BEST!!!" "NAH  FUCK YOU TARD THIS SHIT IS THE BEST!!!" or if you say one negative thing about a series some weeaboos will come around and bash you with a thousand and one negative fanboy comments saying "HOW DARE U THIS SHOW IS SACRED!!" Shit drives me crazy. If anyone asks for recommendations from me I would gladly point them in the right direction but I would ask them what THEY would want to watch not shove what I like down their throat and if not it doesn't bother me one bit. Discovering new things is something people should do on their own, not be forced into.
There is nothing more ironic than the comment section of a filthy frank video
I considered myself otaku in the terms where I live since far as I can remember.
And this is AMAZING!!
I leave this video in a facebook group I used to be only to watch how they fight over anime like naruto and fairy tail (also hentai) cause they considered himself 'OTAKUS' and Most of them are weeaboos. I mean, all of them.
I was banned and blocked by many contacts. And I had 23 messages of hatred. The worst of this is that they all live in my city. And they are from 9 to 35 years old, with families, kids, and that stuff.
They dress like hipsters and their hair is all like sasuke uchiha. Not kidding.
I regret nothing. I Rather spend my time on MAL looking for new and old stuff to watch and read, and used the little money I got to buy my own stuff, than fighting over anime that are overrated.

weeaboos are stuck on the most well known anime. they don't like manga. They don't even read manga.
They don't respect anyone's opinion. I know this, because there's a girl in my class that is a weeaboo.
I only talked to her when she first move to my school cause she was the very first person I met in a school that watch anime. And then I realized that she was a weeaboo. So I stop talking to her, she too. She was aggressive. "I don't like that anime, eew I watch anime, not read manga! HOW CAN YOU LIKE THAT ANIME?! WATCH THIS ONE INSTEAD!! I don't lie, I felt like scared by her strange personality.
So yeah, I stop talking to her, I rather I'm all alone in school that with a person like her...
She 'speak' like an anime character, using that tone of voice. I swear, she think she IS a japanese girl. Her friends also support this stupid idea. Is just... dumb.


Also once there was an 'anime asian fest' in my city (my city is small as fuck) which I didn't went cause of $ and as far as I know, it was a totally mess.
There were NOTHING about anime or japan culture. N O T H I N G . It was filled with weeaboos to non stop, normal people, curious, people with shirts of METAL BANDS, and only like 3 cosplayers. There wasn't manga to sell, anime stuff to self. NOTHING!! Only pins and posters and cakes.

So uh yeah. that's all I will say about weeaboos. 

I watch my shit 24/7. And I'm proud of it. Its like a secret I don't share with people outside my house.

Peace.
What is the music that plays as weeaboo jones enters the weeaboo protection chamber?
Hue
Is there a cure though?
What did the pigeon do to get your hostility? Lol It only wanted to hear your discussion on Weeaboos
SUBFUCKINGSCRIBED MADDA FAKKAH YOU DUH REEL MVP!
How to upset a weeaboo:
That's some nice japanese comic you're readin'.
this whole video is me omf XDDDD
Weeaboos should all kill themselves with their bullshit "art" online collectible swords amirite
This is funny as hell XD A bit offensive but hilarious!
Dude, our third life is saying some nasty shit about you. You can't let her masturbating club call you out like that. Maybe if you tell her off, you Percy and Harold can get in a gang bang like you did in your dreams. Good luck
Time to get my reading glasses and popcorn to see these comments
Screw you I watch Family Guy
I found Weaboo Jones on TF2 once
XD LOL there are so many in my school it sucks
Dear Franku senpai, weeaboos are raiding my channel after I made a video titled "dragon ball Z sucks." What should I do?
This was the first FilthyFrank video i saw. I thought he was a confused Asian man that was about to show us his collection of rare pepes
Song @ 6:42? (No Darude-Sandstorm pls)
I thought of this after going to my first day of Japanese classes
I collect weapons, such as butterfly knifes, Karambit's, and a sword or two, but i wouldn't consider myself a "Weeaboo".
Yes i watch anime from time to time, but that's pretty much it. Whateves, call me what u want, but ill still be here tomorrow doing something better and more productive than i did yesterday!
#MyWifeIsComingToLife Zx1TheRedNinja:2015
Haha Nice!
steam sales is best anime
Is this guy for real??
I wonder why he cracks his voice while he talks? deepthroat gone wrong or something?
Can't stop watching this video my friend showed me him I love this
Is that what he really sounds like
As an anime fan I actually found this video really fun! (not a weeaboo though)
Yeah I know one smitty from our thrid life I Agee with you I fucking hate weeaboos
that face 4:11.. LOL
Watching 1000 anime series while eating pocky, plus sleeping on giant ass body pillows and learning how to speak Japanese on Rosttea stone, does not make you legally Japanese.
Are you wearing Nakamura's jersey?
I have a small penis.  am I ASIAN ?
This is like my favorite video now... Lol.

2- furries
3- bronies
1:28
cowboy tanaka haha
Airplane instruction videos from the 80's is my favorite anime too papa franku

Filthy frank sucks
My fav anime is icarly m8
Goddamn chinese cartoons
6:57
I hate weeaboos.
Could be worse. Could be one of the "in your face" bronies.
subscribed lol
How is King of The Hill not your favorite anime?
If you are a weeaboo...kys
I collect weapons, but I do because I'm a collector of them.
pretty spry for being 52
his japanese voice sounds different by a considerable amount than his english voice. Mostly the raspy-ness
weeeaboo
XD WOW This was GREAT! I gotta see more of this! Hahaha!
I was a weeaboo then Filthy Frank showed me the light... I'm not a weeaboo anymore.
Weeaboos, sigh.
i love anime but not like a weeaboo
seriously though, weeaboo hate has gotten to the point where people just hate japanese content in general, not just anime. its sad...
franku........ dj funky fresh ft james franco
[Warning: This message is not meant for anyone, its just a comment!] Well I watch anime, know "SOME" Japanese and learned a few songs in Japanese.. This does not make me a weeaboo :), i love being a BEINER! Also Attack On Titan is bad! The opening is better than the whole anime !
I watch anime but I have no fucking interest in learning their language because I have no plans on going there... I just watch the stuff that's dubbed over with English voice acting.
GAAAAWD DIS IS JUST WETARDED! YOU FILTHY ANIMAL YOU SHOULDNT MAK VIDS ANYMORE IM OFFENDED AND feel dat u are just a loser that dont understANd AnIMe lyk meee. anime is love and u r peniS.
The Filthy Frank Show is the best ANIME!!!
You made my day man xD you're fucking awesome
One of those nerds was holding a katana in an ice pick grip which is used for stabbing while katanas are slashing weapons. Do you even sword, bro?
I find it disturbing 8:49 
Actually i never knew thqt such people exist but they are sad people in my opinion
What is the word Waifus meaning? I never heard of that
The people with anime pictures are the worst, they all fucking act like they know every little thing about anime.
:p
whats the song salamander man plays on his recorder
Holyyy asscrack this was funny as helllll
a
Sub to me
Where are the subtitles again?
I prefer old school anime like Malcolm in the middle
the Filthy Frank show! the show that will protect you from being a weeaboo, but it will also make you sick you're whole life, that's why i watch it everyday :3
The 2k people that didn't like this are probably weaboos.
Oh god damnit I just noticed the one guy holding a lucky star manga or something
I hate when weeaboos like Lucky Star, they have to be the worlds biggest creeps about it. Niggas start talking about lolicon and shit. I aint signed up for that. I just like Lucky Star because its downright pleasant, but these guys watch a friendly, pleasant conversation between friends and get all horny for no goddamned reason.
Franku should make a video on country music
Filthy Frank is now my new spirit animal
Filthy frank plz kill me I was bitten by one and its out of control I don't have any costumes I don't think I'm Japanese, no collections,but I want to go to Japan

How can I stop it
Does my avatar count as anime?
fag
weaboo ..
kill yourself
you fucking shit
What if I wanna learn Japanese but cant find any classes at local colleges, can I try Rosetta stone without being a filthy weaboo?!?!?! prease help senpai bukkake!
xD i collect things from anime but im not that crazy i just like it and i think they are cool to have even if i cant use em
anime sucks
I'm not sure if my pic counts as anime.
What better way to celebrate my own birthday by watching all of Frank's videos, I wish there were more though :3
McDonald's is the best anime
Also that girl at 9:44 is actually really pretty ; -;
I'll be honest here. I watch anime but even still.... there are some animes and people i tend to avoid...
Legend spot on 100%
Is this dude disabled? I mean the bursting way he speaks is kinda frightening to me
why doesnt he monetize his videos ?
I know I'm on the internet too much when youtube suggest me this.
LMFAO OMG!!! My landlord/roommate is a Weeaboo!!! its really disturbing, weird and pretty fucked up
I've been called Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and i don't know why i don't look Asian .
Glad this video was made. I know now I'm not a weeb yay :D
" alot of people have these anime avatars " Looks at my avatar Well, shit.
Well I'm not a weeaboo I respect there culture and love anime and still love Japan and both America I'm not a weeaboo but I do know how to use a katana not a weeb
I`m half Japanese half Egyptian my father is Egyptian, I lived in Egypt without my mom almost all my life, I learned 90% of my English through movies and 90% of my Japanese through Anime and movies . Our teachers who teach us English in Egypt have fucked up english accents  , movies laid the foundation for me , if not for that I would of had a fucked up english like most of the Arabs. The same with Japanese Once I got the accents and the basics I began to take legit /Japanese lessons,and Anime/movies made me go through that shit like a knife through butter, when I went to Japan for the first time ,nobody could tell that its my first time in Japan. So filthyFrank is just trying to shit on the medium and its fans for the views,he got some points right but as he said this can be applied to other Obsession like FootballTards, JustinBieber Tards,One directionTards, ComicbooksTards,Westaboos (who are common in Japan ) etc. Learning language through media is much better than schools at least in my case ,of course I had little help from tutors and such but to be honest they only helped me in the writing and reading part the most as I was almost perfect in other areas.
Don`t be ashamed of being a fan of something that you like whether it is Anime, Japanese culture in general,Arab culture,whatever da FUCK ! dont let anyone get in your head, of course that doesn`t mean to be extreme about it ~
just realized where pewdiepie copied his voice from..
gg hhhhhhhhhhhhh
LMAO
4:10 I laughed so fucking hard
"I have a joke for ya! Weeaboos go to Japan and be like: "W-where are the subtitles?!""
Yeah man totally right people with a picture of anime people suck (especially ones that have a guy in a green shirt with white arm wraps named rock lee) they totally suck >=( =P
Believe in yourself Frank. You can be a train if you believe hard enough.
that fake anime voice he did was so accurate omfg
put on sub titles¬†XD
ive been wanting to go to japan since i was little because of its rich culture and intresting history ironically i hated anime up until around 2 years ago so i dont think im a weeaboo i sure hope not XD i mean i like my own native american culture too does it help that i like french culture XD also someone tell me if im a weeaboo
well I have a sword but is for the zombie apocalipse plus is not a katana
I love anime but I hate japan jeez I see those japs on the streets Im like "fuck ur mom and ur culture my dad was killing ur dad for fun bitch" komi motherfuckers I'd deop that bomb again u fucking japs fat man is the name remember it komi fucks!!... now Im definitely not a weaboo

"its filthy frank Mother fucker"
I have animephobia
Next thing he should insult - 
Bronys who jerk off to pony's.
Pretty much every FNAF fan ever. I don't know where to start with them.
People who are dating people they have never met over the internet.
Every conspiracy theorist ever.
you'd think natural selection would take care of these faggots by now.
As an anime fan, I confirm all of this.
this was the least weirdes filthy frank video ever
I...I thought i was gonna watch another "we hate weaboos omw you like anime you must be weeb trash" video, but then you actually made sense?? Thank you youtube for sending me here.
And yea I'm not gonna take advice from  A screaming guy in a dirty shirt :) Vlogs are not my source of wisdom.

If I'm an Elder Scrolls OC does that make me a weeanerd?
I hate when weeaboos say they are otakus.


I ask "What's the most interesting thing you know about Japan?"
My favorite animes are The Filthy Frank Show and Cory in the House
Êó•Êú¨Ë™û‰∏äÊâã„Åà„Å™„Åä„ÅÑÔΩóÔΩóÔΩó
so...what's the deal with all anime characters (other than everyone from jojo) having "please poke my eyes out" size? how the hell do you live for 5 minutes without poking your eyes out?
Now I'm picturing Frank humping a Chuck Norris body pillow while having Woody from Toy Story 1-3 shoved up his ass.

I'm going to go pray to Celestia and masturbate to Rarity wearing an SS Uniform now.  Soo Awesome.......  /)^3^(\
that part when the guy cosplaying sasuke got arrested XD
Wow, when i heard that anime moan (only in audio), i honestly it was a chick doing that voice, but now that i seen the person behind that voice, i regret my imagination from happening that day. Frank, you ventriloguist son of a bitch! lol
Saiyanfeld
That ain't Falco
I'm disturbed nobody mentioned drake and josh as the best anime of all time! Screw the mainstream animes like Cory in the house!

Even Weeaboo Jones and the power of his gigantic blue balls couldn't stand a chance against Frank's Reality Check!
Omg your favorite anime is cory in the house, your my new best friend
'Avatar: The Last Airbender' and 'The Boondocks' are the best anime of all time.
Hey FilthyFrank!!!! You should make a rant video about people that get offended at everything. Butthurt ism is a real thing and it sucks ass. And I think you could nail that topic.
Educational time!!!
Wapanese: a slur used to describe a white person who is obssesed with japanese culture. This would include manga/hentai/and anime. From late 2003 and onwards, usage of Wapanese became alarmingly visible on 4chan, often leading to unpleasant exchanges between anime/manga fans and those who were far less interested in their subcultures.
At the peak of its abuse in mid-2005, 4chan moderators devised a creative intervention using the word-filter, replacing every instance of Wapanese with ‚ÄúWeeaboo,‚Äù which was a fictitious term originally coined by Nicholas Gurewitch in his Perry Bible Fellowship comic strip.

I'm Actually part Japanese & African American. I don't speak Japanese unless somebody comes up to me and speaks Japanese to me. Which rarely happens due to me currently living in the U.S. People usually don't know my ethnicity due to my hair. Filthy Frank is right. Real Japanese conversations do sound different compared toAnime because its called acting. And there is a difference between Weeaboo and a person who is overly obsessed with anime to the point of it being considered a mental illness. Which is funny. Because there are Japanese people who go to far as well. I mean, A guy in Japan legally married Hatsune Miku. Which is a virtual wife. Due to the fact he became so obsessed with Anime, real women couldn't compare to his favorite Anime girls. Overly obsessed Anime lovers that don't hygiene Is a bad condition. Weeaboo is nothing but a stereotype used to categorize those types of people. Due to not understanding that most of those people are insecure about their lives. Just like people who hide behind an Avatar or character. How can you find a Quote on Quote Weeaboo? Easy, ask them if they know the Traditional Capital of Japan. After claiming they're of a Japanese ethnicity. Or they are some what of the culture. Most of them will say, "Tokyo." (=_=;)
What am I if I am european, I don't enjoy anime, I don't speak japanese, I don't own any katana, I do taekwondo (which is korean), but I still find japanese girls the most attractive and I really wanna get one? Is there a name for that?
why was sasuke-kun arrested?
we know that 2,354 people that watch your videos are in fact weeaboos.
Hey b0ss
Yea screw dem anime avatar guys,they need to die.
Herro, my name is Cowboy Tanaka.
hhahha i was just typing to a weeboo fag when i was watching the video

You weeaboo trash disgust me, anime is a bunch of crap, and a stain on our planet. GTFO of the internet and get a freaking life.
everything was fun and games til the weeaboo pics flew out.... im from the u.s. but that just straight up creep me out
I'm taking Japanese I for credits and I also watch hentai, does that make me a weaboo?
"I've had so much sex with my body pillow, it stands on its own now" 
B0s pls am dyin stop
Are there any more videos like this?
Funny how half the people here are all butthurt because they have anime profile pictures, watch the whole video, he says that if you're letting a guy in a unwashed blue shirt run your life, that's sad. IRONNNNNYYY
Im not a Weeaboo... am I? *questions existence *¬† * dies *
my favorite amine is imperialism
I love watching Anime, and wouldn't mind having a few figurines, and possibly. Just possibly a poster, or two. That would be enough for me. I also have a full time job to support this shit. HOORAY!!! XD
The amazing world of gumball, spongebob, Mickey Mouse, and family guy are my favorites
ok
That opening though.
You could easily be a voice actor. that's the best.
senifeild xD
conglaturation on 1000000 retarded subscriber pieces of shit franku

He's my husbando.
Did he say there were two Jews in his closet? And that they're both dead?
XD weeaboos are cancer
Frank, I like your shirt.  It's a nice shirt.  It'd be cool if you cooked it and ate it one day.
SPODERMAN AGREES
my favorite anime was when the teenage ninja turtles showed up on full house and shoved uncle Jesse.
My friend Patrick tries to learn Japanese from fucking flashcards for 2 year olds, and he spends like fuckin' ¬£200 on anime each year

do I euthanize him now orrrrrrr
anime
meme
animeme

wake up sheeple
Rip
I'm so ashamed. I have introduced 
Anime to my cousin and now she says she's Japanese and not Canadian. I HAVE CREATED THE WORST WEEABOO EVER!
I just want to say this, first off, not a weeaboo at all, but weapon collecting as a hobby is okay, right? I own multiple swords, but not just katanas, I only have them because the design of katanas are actually quite nice, as well as smooth cuts, is there any signs of weebooism in that, if there is, how do I purge the filth from my soul?
HAI ME SO KAWAII AND IM 12 YEARS OLD BUT MY BOOBS ARE HUUUUUUUUGE- all school animes ever
"hey boss"
I remember my buddy Alexis showing me this
XD I'm an Otaku and holy shit this is funny as hell
one thing run for your life cause there coming
I cringe at these people, as much as I watched anime (Childhood was nothing but Ed, Edd and Eddy and some of the best animes)I wouldn't even think of losing my dignity, I understand a logo of an anime, but really?
(Too be honest I'd rather live in japan than america at this moment in time, we look like complete jackasses)

But any way, I may be a anti-social freak, (Long story lets just say I was separated away from my family for 3 years and a half due to a back stab from a social worker. Which I'll don't even feel a connection to my family, there just... There.) But these people let something over take there life, That any one can create not just Japan.

Now if you need me(And actually read that cluster fuck of my thoughts), I'll go talk to my stuffed animal from when I was younger.

Great vid none the less.
Half of these people with anime aviators denouncing the fact that most of them are weeabos.
LMAFO!!!!!!
W-w-w-where are the subtitles??
Rosetta Stone
AM I TOO ANIMU FOR YOU?
This is hysterical. I have some weeaboos at my school who need to listen to this. It's gotten to a point where they try to spread this disease to others. Any ways I can stop this? I'm all ears. Also Frank's got dope raps!
Was gonna make a comment and then I looked at my avatar. Shit.

Got a new plan, Hey Uncle Sam!(look out now)

Cory in the House! 
I'm your man!
"if you like to watch a little hentai on the downlow that's none of my business" ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
omg yes XD I need to show this to my weeaboo friend
7:56 fucking destroyed me xD
i thought weeaboos didn't exist, but then i met one, this is my story.

so back in highschool i see this girl reading a hellsing magna (if i remember correctly)
me: "oh i think i saw that anime before, hellsing"
her: "YEAH IT IS, WHOSE THE MAIN CHARACTER"
a few seconds of thinking because i was about to say hellsing
me: alucard right?
her: "OMG, DO YOU WANT TO HEAR MY FANFICTION"
me: ..... opens my mouth to say no thank you
her: "ALUCARD IS MARRIED TO A GIRL ASUMI WHO CAN CUT PEOPLE UP INTO 3 PIECES IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE"
me: (oh shit i fucked up, ABORT ABORT) sorry i'm not interested speed walked away.

months later at a in school pizza party for english 12, i saw her wearing a Naruto headband and waving a fan infront of her face, i wanted to say to her that you look like a jackass but i didn't want to look like a asshole infront of everyone, but the thought certainly crossed my mind. occasionally you'll see her walking around with a white wig, its was funny in a sad way.

¬†you could get the vibe that everyone pretty much hated her, she thinks its because she ugly (and she kind of is) but really its because she doesn't stop talking, even the teacher becomes passive aggressive when she gets out of hand, like she has no utter self control. if weeaboo was in the dictionary her face would be right next to it.
Shut up baka. Animes are awesome and Tokyo Ghoul and attack on titan are better than any of this. You don't even have a waifu and if you did, my kawaii waifu is better in every way.
I'm lowkey weeaboo like i cant (i dont have the capacity)learn the language and sometimes i watch anime, but i like all the cute stuff that involves japan. Also i would love to visit for the sites and food so idk what you would call me....
we dont say weaboo without "we" . We all in this together XD
That neckbeard scene was just gold
sweats
+TVFilthyFrank             hhhhmmm.. how to say this.. Ah yes. So here's the thing you used a LOT of blanket statements. Especially the thing about the people with anime avatars.. I happen to have one simply because i like anime and don't feel the need to put my face on the internet. Not to mention some of the things you spoke of weren't even limited to the weeaboo community. i'm not going to be rude but if you going to talk about weeaboos you don't have to be an ass about it. lot's of people would be seriously offended even if they themselves aren't weeaboos. maybe their friend is a weeaboo so don't be a jerk.
Are you batman?
you guys should check out "melonpan", hes a swiss youtuber guy, ther were about 3 pics of him in the song
sounds like Adam Green at the end.
"Where are the subtitles?" I died.
I love anime, I draw anime, sometimes I wear clothes with anime characters on them, and I do speak quite a bit a Japanese, but I am in no way a weeaboo. I do like and respect Japanese culture, but I don't downgrade American culture, and I also don't place random Japanese words into sentences and pronounce them wrong and shit (And I know more words then kawaii, sugoi and hai. The extent of a weeaboo's Japanese vocabulary consists of very few, commonly used words that they most likely learned through an anime. Sure, I've learned some Japanese through anime, but I also want to learn it fully with the help of something else other then anime). I also don't talk about anime constantly unless someone else brings it up or someone asks what my favorite shows are and stuff.
I don't get why people call me a weeaboo, even though I clearly am not one. I'm just a girl who likes anime. XD
Try me
I have a plane and I sing ISIS songs all day. I have a bomb collection too. WISH ME LUCK IN ISIS
Much time this guy has spent on this corny video, it's still fucking hilarious and true xD ahahaha
Boku no pico motherfuckers
Why is his voice different in japanese i hate his voice when he speaks english
Yea screw dem anime avatar wannabes! D:
Anyone notice that there's barley any skinny and attractive weeaboos?
6:56 hey b00s
WEEABOOS ARE EVERY WHERE!!!!???
He lives in japan?
I've watched this shit so many times I probably have Frank $10 in ad revenue.
Cringe as fuck.
...THANK YOU..so much for this..thank you!
I kinda wish I didn't take three years of Japanese so I wouldn't have to know FilthyFrank has two dead people in his closet....lol :3
Literally the only fandom I don't have a problem with are furries. They seem pretty chill.
My top ten animes:
1. Shrek
2. More Shrek
3. Even Moar Shrek
4. Sex with Shrek
5. Shrek in my ass
6. Shrek hentai 
7. Shrek
8. Cloning Shrek so he can fuck me five times over
9. SHREK
10. SHREK IS LOVE
ugh, W/E im not a WEEABOO i just happens to have my little japanese shrine for George Carlin, i even made the picture look like in anime, and i have George Carlin body pillow, but im not a Weeaboo, not in anyway, at all. only a faggot.
im going to tell my school about my friend buying japanese weapons he cannot use
I may be weebaboo trash but I promised my integrity not to buy a body pillow. However, my wall is filled with posters of anime boys T__T
I hope to Buddha that he doesn't sound like this in real...
7:20 weeaboo jones
FilthyFrank is 52 years old confirmed.
is that his real voice? please reply
he said collecting swords.... I like mu claymore....oh those blades lol
Fuck you JAPANS
It's okay, Frank. I also wanted a piece of Percy's green ass when I was 3.
I can't breath XD
Another way to spot a weaboo, if they get offended from this video
LOL!!! I like anime,  and any weapon, so since the childhood I have a katana, machete, pistol, rifle collection,
I like and respect japan culture, basically, because it's an advanced culture,
I'm just a right guy that have non-conventional likes!
And I found this video Hilarius and fun
no need to be ofended!
I lol'd so ard watching this :'D
This man deserves some kind of medal for hitting the proverbial nail on the proverbial head. Once crazy fanatics get involved in a genre of entertainment, every one else either has to constantly feel the need to defend their tastes or they become disgusted with their affiliation to said fanatics. Truly sad for those who just admire a great piece of art from a different country.
o_O The part where you imitated the anime speech. You sound exactly like them
I put this video in the anime suggestion box at my college's anime club.
Breaths heavily and pounds keyboard
1:43 and 4:31 are my favorite parts
a wild weeaboo appeared!
I am still creeped out at the fact that those things are called "waifus" and are a regular selling item for people to buy.

Even if I was a really big fan of an anime, I would not buy one of those.
Does this count as anime
New to this channel, and paused this video because I instantly got sick of it. Does he speak like this through the entire time? I appreciate the subject matter and the fact that he has an opinion on it, but damn I can't stomach the way he's speaking. Prolly not going to watch any more of this. Just had to say something.
I think I found my new favourite YouTuber
bronies plz

What's worse. People with anime avatars or people with MLP avatars?
Fuck off Haters.
AlphaOmegaSin sent me here.
Should've made fun of one piece but that was pretty funny
i love the fact over  2000 got pissed off at this üòÉ
Fuck everybody who hates anime. Anime is FUCKING LIFE
Im in college and in a religion class where i am going to use  weeaboos for a project of a cult like culture can you help Frank?
4chan breeds the most disgusting/toxic environments I have ever seen on the internet.... Next to tumblr. Gotta be cool and put people down with Middle school politics. If someone wants to embarrass the hell out of themselves let them, you won't see me anywhere in the vicinity actually giving a damn. I usually encourage people to go to different countries and see different cultures, but imho, I feel like both the 'weaboo haters' and the 'weaboos' are in the wrong. Being curious in different cultures and nations is healthy and I personally feel like traveling is the biggest cure for ignorance. In the case of this 4chan debacle, I feel like pretentious individuals who mimic a culture without genuine knowledge/interest is wrong (it comes off as offensive and ignorant). I also feel like those who discourage interest in different cultures are also in the wrong.
I was drawing manga while watching this...
OMG! I fucking love your humor! hahahahaaha
I'm so happy somebody is helping take down the weeaboo menace
look at all those losers at the end
<---------
I tell you Hwat, don't talk shit bout my animooos
Fucking weeaboo is going to japan and be like:  wh.. wh.. where are the subtitles xD
08:56 this guy reminds me of dosia from hellraisers xD
Anyone?
Filthy Frank, You have saved the soul of my friend. He was a weaboo. Now, he is a normal person. I will sacrifice to Chin Chin sama now.
I love how frank just runs around his apartment building, fucking around
I see the appeal of Anime but it's not my cup of tea.
I like anime
Weeaboo's are on their Chuunnibyo 
Anyways, not every Anime Fans are weeaboos
Just ordered a Cory in the House body pillow online. It's on back order :(
FRANKU YOU SAID IT!!!! I loved anime and people refer to me as a weeb ass person,and i also love other things more than anime! And I NEVER watched Hentai even 1 time!!!!!
6:57 xD
Its so true it hurts
I wanna say this- weaboo's can only be weaboo's if they are Japanese. ._.
I watch dragon ball z and I want to be like him, I would denounce my culture to be a fucking SSGSS. but I dont give a shit about Japanese tho.. Am I a weaboo.
I've never seen a weeaboo in real life. they must be really disgusting
FUCKING WEEABOO FAGGOTS, GET OUT
I JUST WANTED A PIECE OF PERCIE'S ASS! YOU KNOW I JUST WANTED A PIECE OF THAT HELICOPTER'S ASS!
Everyone respond to this what your favorite amine(intentional spelling). Mine happens to be the bee movie along with the long running series Mickey Mouse clubhouse
Got called a weeaboo incorrectly. Fun times.
God damn this video is still entertaining to this day.
weeaboos are creepier than bronys
All animes are shit
Except for DBZ and Pokemon
Those shows were badass
My fave anime is The Bee Movie
This is one of the most retarded video i ever watched, like why would you even care, shut your mouth if you your just gonna speak bad stuff about anime, you do what you want but making fun of anime can hurt other people's feeling, other people loves anime because that's their opinion not yours, people that learns japanese from anime are trying their best, if you know that they're pronouncing it wrong why don't you just help them out instead of making fun of them and calling them names fucken retarded, Listen listen , dont ever post bullshit like this again, whatever kind of race you are , for me you're stupid asf for making this video
1:04 WRONG. Watching any anime, at all, deliberately, makes you a full on fourth-degree weeaboo.
WTF is Roseta Stone? Also fuck weeaboos they are creepy and weird.
B0ss i have a question 

what if a weeaboo bites me ?
2,327 weeaboos disliked this video
What do you think about anime?
It's getting to the point where Weeaboos, emo kids and mixes are really hard to tell apart.
At 4:55 when you start talking about how it's basically racist to do what other cultures are doing, isn't that the same thing that's going on with pretty much most of the world now with people all acting like their "young, black, rich and famous"? I totally agree with you and think that people need to start living their own lives instead of imitating others.
Know what i hate most? in any thing like anime, games shows etc
weeaboos who say
"then you're not a true anime fan"
Weeaboos also tend to put anime first in their to-do's list. I am unfortunate to have a group mate who is a major Weeabo and refuses to do our animation project just because it wasn't anime. :I

We're planning to kick him out anyway.
so true
4:11 best part of the video
franku senpai fist my ass
Lol learning japanese on rosetta stone
8:52: WOMENS?? FKIN WOMENS?!!!!
FULL ON CAPSLOCK!
kage bunshin no jutsu..
This youtuber, Frank, is the ONLY youtuber who has ever made me laugh this hard. Thank you, Frank, hahahaha. So glad I finally came across your videos.
lmao hentai on the down low

My favourite animes are - Toy story and also Corey in the house it's very "Kawaii" C:
Will frank do a vid bout all fandoms please :D man I love these rants
i hate this guy and like this guy at the same time.....is that normal?
YEA WHITE PEOPLE FUCKING SUCK
YOUR THE FUNNIEST PERSON IVE EVER SEEN LIKE I LOVE YOU
I EAT ASS
Haha
I unironically have an anime avatar and for that I have sinned.
I guess I get what you mean frank because I've wanted to try and learn Japanese and get a katana ( because they look cool ) but I wouldn't cosplay or buy a body pillow and I don't care about you making fun of anime I'll just take it as a joke . But I guess it's weird that I have a notebook  just for writing down anime I have/am going to watch. Btw I could not stop laughing at this video XD
Frank is real jesus for helping us cleanse the internet of weeaboos
you deserve to be a princess in the land of cum farts
1:56 killed me
I'm just an anime fan, and I fucking hate weaboos. Like they ruin our rep man.
Pls call me a weaboo, senpai.
Your waifu is shit
I'll admit, I'm probably borderline weeb. I love anime, reading manga, and Japanese culture as a whole. I also want to visit Japan some day. Does that declare me as a weeb? No. I know I live in the US, and I accept that. I like American things too like reading novels, burgers, and tv. :P
FilthyFrank. I am disappointed that you didn't mention anime Cinema classics like The Room and Troll 2....
play the attack on titan theme at my funeral
This video has been added to the American Film Institute as one of the most important and culturally significant films of all time
Anime?
i need to watch this to cleanse my soul after watchin venusangelic
I wonder what his parents think of him... don't worry Franku I still love you
Anime is so different form the stuff I watch I want to join this stuff but it's kinda weird
An
God dammit I can't watch this without my roommate walking in... and slowly walking back out.
XD lmao Anime is retarded af
The filthy frank fanbase is more cancerous than weeaboosfite me fukz
It's sad I know a weeaboo that gets pissed if you talk shit about anime. anime is fun to watch occasionally but if you're addicted and can't respect people's opinions you're a weeaboo
I like Anime. I like manga. I would like to visit Japan, but I'm not a weeaboo. I'm not obsessed, watch my own nations content just as much/ more etc. 3/X signs of weeaboo = not a weeb right?

9:58 PBG is that you?
My cousins are Weeaboos.  The family reunion consisted of me attacking them with a high powered airsoft gun, since nailing them with a crossbow bolt is "Illegal".  I'm waiting for the local NRA Department to open a fall Weeaboo hunting season.
Wow this guy is such a faggot! ^_^ Ha ha haxD.
Nop, I'm actually a huge fan of mangas and Anime and stuff, but I'm definitely NOT going to live in Japan, they're all so weird, plus I don't want to get sick XD Anyway, I liked your video bro ! :D
ey b0ss
Seinfield is my favorite anime too.
does anybody know what song plays when Frank runs to the weaboo protection chamber?
"Konichiwa...................rosetta stone"
I hate weeaboos
"all my friends are ashamed of me".
At least they have friends . 
Oh my god where did my life go wrong ...
Rosetta Stone.
The Problem Solverz is the best anime.
LOL!!!!!
This was on my recommended videos in the category of "Politics." Thanks YouTube.
Oh shit mom
Why did I laugh at the state farm commercial before the video than the actual video
2'310 Weeaboos watched this, lol
Watch it with subtitles enabled..
but your japanese is actually quite good.
He actually sounds really good talking in Japanese at the start.......
What's with two dead jews inside your closet?
YES FAGGOTS THAT'S THE TRUTH
IM CRYINGüòÇ
What is weeaboo?
Ahahahahahahahaha this vid makes me laugh hard ASF.
I watch anime and i learn from it :D Don't worry i pronounce them right :D
I'm a WEEABOO i Admit :) "Haters gonna hate" They really gotta make vid saying shit :D Just for likes and views ^^
Do I count as a weeaboo if I'm learning the language (1006 Kanji already!) because I want to support the industry but the manga I want to read isn't available in English?
Weedaboo Jones,DAT walk tho xD
I aint a weeaboo, but dont talk s*** about aot
I hate going onto a anime's discussion or chat and see people typing in romaji or saying desu or baka in every sentence . Like bitch. please. I know your American or whatever.
But you see those people everywhere now so yea
you would probably make a great voice actor
top 5 animetion

I can't fucking breath I need to study omh it's 12:00
10:03 ISNT SHE FROM BAKUGAN LMAO
Its kinda boring all these people saying they aren't weeaboos so I'm gonna say I'm definitely a weeaboo, COME AT ME BITCHES
I like the anime To love ru
Videos like this make me happy.
I fucking love this video. I lost it at Cory in the house and was crying from laughter all the way to the end. Subscribed!
I taut I was in that "weird part of YouTab" but a pear ant Lee this is already virusly man's stream and out and about in the reel whirl'd... I'm scared for the you-man raze.
lol be aware , i am not a weeaboo , i will never fuck a body pillow , but anyway i have one question  , wouldnt the opposite of a ANIME FAN be an AMERICAN COMIC FAN? i keep hearing this whole " you dont see japanese people with cowboy hats etc" idk i can kind of expect to see japanese people cosplay as like american comics or somethin , even games.
There's so much hate about weeaboos I think I might throw up.
I pretty much learned a bit of japanese by watching anime but i dont pronounce it wrong, i have no axcent because im also asian, plus it is not stupid , people pronounce it wrong because they just probably have axcent, just saying
:D
FRANKU CAN MAKE SOME SICK BEATS
I'm learning how to speak japanese but I don't randomly say the words I know and I don't collect a bunch of stuff I can't use but I'm kinda a knew fan.....I wonder if I am a weeaboo
notice me senpai
9:20 cringed so hard I broke my face
I collect swords... I'm not a weaboo... :(
"My neighbors heard that for sure. I think my neighbors are weeabos they probably think that I am getting mad pussy" I never laughed so hard.
So, I have never bought something anime related irl, meaning no hug pillow, onaholes, animes boobs/butts for hand support etc. On the other hand I read doujinshi pretty much 1 hour every night and fap, I also watch quite a bit of anime, mostly ecchi or psychological thriller. I guess I am normal then.
1. I watch anime
2.I try to learn Japanese from watching subbed anime so then later I wouldn't need the subs so I can watch more comfortably xD. They talk so nice
3.Those body pillows look cuddly >w>

Conclusion: I know what I like. If that makes you mad, you must be jealous bcz i can have so much fun and pleasure just by simple easy access things. And no I don't have any social or psychological problem so nothing is sorry about my case :3

BITCH YOU BURNT!!!!!!!!!!!
man people are so stereotypical these days like people want to make themselves feel better by picking on weaboos I'm not one I just like anime but if picking on them makes you feel better than your just an automatic grade A asshole
BRUH

Has anyone saved the two dying Jews in his closet yet?

We all want helicopter ass in this life and the next.
Wait frank is 52. What?
Ikr. Weeaboos and their stupid anime icons. Stupid anime graphics
If i just watch some animes does that make me a weeaboo?
My favorite anime is chicken
What about those fucking people who obsess over doctor who but have only seen the episodes with Matt Smith
i kinda hope someone was watching Frank doing this and being like "what the fiddly diddly fuck?"
Do the furrys nextüòÇüòÇ they're worse
Is he playing pomp and circumstance on his recorder
Cory in the house=best animu
Anime is? (Insert obsurd comment chain made up of premature man-childs who make fun of others likings for seemingly no reason here!)
anyone else getting audio cutouts...?
desu desu desu desu cory in the house desu anime desu
Why is he speaking spanish at the beginning of the video?
1:17 is that an anime? If so tell me what anime it is. (BREATHES HEAVILY) Please. :3
jesus fuck there's a girl in my school that is a weaboo... fuck... I guess I need switch schools now
that pink guy nod when frank asked him if he remembers the training xD that's golden roflmao

It's hilarious because there is actually a huge ass difference between weeaboos and people who just like watching anime
Oh Gawd
woah...this channel is awesome
uhhh looks at my profile ......i swear to god i'm not a weeaboo D:
Can I take this seriously? Not trying to be mean or rude just wondering.
As long as this (0:31) is the definition we use to describe a ''Weeaboo'', then it's fine with me! Just don't go around throwing ''Weeaboo'' in peoples faces who just like Japanese related stuff.
Japanese Anime with english subtitle is better than American cartoon like little kids. When i was little, I love watching American cartoons like Cartoon Network and etc. Now like Anime such as Dragon Ball Z and Naruto inspired me to watch more Anime.
AND DON'T FUCKING CALL ME A WEEABOO JUST BECAUSE OF MY NAME AND MY AVATAR. IT DOESN'T COUNT TO ALL YOU STUPID ANIME HATERS!!
I can speak Japanese „Éû„É™„Éï„Ç°„Éä„ÇíÊØéÊó•Âê∏„ÅÜ

Sham Wow is my all time favourite anime
My favorite anime was SAW, I mean look at teh graphics lel
I am so glad this video isn't in some dark corner of the deep web... yet.
Airplane instruction videos from the 80s is my shit!

Why's he putting on that really annoying voice Pewdiepie does? :c
b0ss gibe da pusy!
This video is so fucking hilarious I'm gonna throw up.
Now you guys make me feel like a complete dick to love anime and have an anime avatar. I don't even try to act Japanese or try to speak the language but apparently I'm still weeaboo trash lol.
'Anime was a mistake. It's nothing but trash' - Hayao Miyazaki
Aren't Japanese people technically white?
Well. Now my parents think I'm in my room watching porn. XD
Look at all the weeaboos in the comments
Corey in the house is my favorite anime

Did I just strand on the fucked up side of youtube or something?
Omg he called animes cartoons :o
Anime.
Damn you're good with a ukelele.
Did Frank just make a song parody in the tune of a The Antlers song? Das edgy
i just like to have a avi on as a character I like lol. It's just like someone putting their avi on as a game they like or something. but people automatically think you have a collection of Japanese stuff lol. pretty sad not gonna lie lmao.
dae hate le weebs ecksdee
hello various people of the interwebs! I am curious if you think I'm a weeaboo! I'm Canadian!  I watch anime and trying to learn japanese! I have a katana(but that being said I have many blades from different ethnic groups) I do NOT own any action figures or pillows... but I don't throw away my own culture! I go camping! longboarding! and skating! (lol Canadian staple) so uhh yeah! do you think I'm a weeaboo?
now my parent think me i watching a hentai.. thanks
Problems:

Bronys, Weaboos.


Furry's aren't the kind to get all puffy over a video or comment, but if you try to offend them they will come.
I wonder if the Japanese frank speaks at the start is actual japanese
HOLY SHIT 23 SECONDS INTO THE VIDEO AND I'M ALREADY DEAD

"Weeaboos go to Japan and be like"

LMAO XD I fucking love this haha
In the beginning he said in Japanese "I have two Jews in my closet, they are both dead."
How do you memorize Japanese? I'm struggling
I actually want to learn Japanese on Rosetta Stone mostly so I can watch subbed anime without having to fucking pause every fucking sentence.
If I'm Asian (Korean) can I speak Japanese?
You are the God of dank memage
i'm sensitive,i almost cry when read all of your comments T_T.so offensive.But who cares,when i finish study i'm probally gonna be just like how your song say weeaboos are

im legit scared right now XD
is nobody gonna comment on the fact that he spoke fluent uncut japanese? was he making random sounds or was it edited audio?
Wouldn't weeabos call Attack on Titan Shingeki no Kyojin? Just saying.
Has anyone even seen the beginning of the video? 1:04 there are people out there who enjoy watching anime but aren't fucking weeaboos. Weeaboos have ruined a big part of the anime fanbase cause now everyone calls anyone who watches anime a weeaboo
a

CORY IN THE HOUSE IS ZONICS FAVORITE ANIME
papa frank's japanaese makes me drippy
arigato for the video gosai masu!
 ramen noodles are soo oishiii!
Fake and gay
wait... frank is 52?
I just watched Filthy Frank for the first time. I'm speechless... i-it was so beautiful.
this hit a little bit close to home.
ANNNNNIIIIIMMMEEEEEEEEE!!!!! Breathing really heavy!!! TYPING REALLY FAST!!!! Now I've gotta take this Rasengan outta my ass...
"Filthy Frank is the embodiment of everything a person should not be. He is anti-PC, anti-social, and anti-couth. He behaves and reacts excessively to everything expressly to highlight the ridiculousness of racism, misogyny, legalism, injustice, ignorance and other social blights. He also sets an example to show how easy it is in the social media for any zany material to gain traction/followings by simply sharing unsavoury opinions and joking about topics many find offensive.Yes, there is no denying that the show is terribly offensive, but this terrible offensiveness is a deliberate and unapologetic parody of the whole social media machine and a reflection of the human microcosm that that social media is. Filthy Frank is not racist because when he makes jokes he's not mocking any race but rather the institution of racism itself. He is able to joke about race because he is clearly comfortable discussing and addressing the racial stereotypes which exist and deserve to be made fun of."
hello ill be your snepai for this evening.
I think that Thomas the Tank Engine had way too much fanservice in it. it destroyed the anime for me...
MY COLLECTION OF KNIVES IS NONE OF YOUR GODDAMN BUSINESS YOU TUBBY LITTLE QUEER!
btw, One Piece is bad xDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Your voice remind me of riding a skateboard on pinecones.
He is so attractive <3 Papa Franku let me be your bea <3
Hope those two guys in your closet don't decay before you get rid of the bodies.
2.270 Weeaboos watched this video since now.
I'm pretty sure after "I'll teach you something pretty good", words are kinda wrong XD....
I think you said that there some kind of people inside your closet and you mentioned that one of them are dying?? XD
People with hentai avatars should suicide themselves.
This video is every bit as funny as I thought it'd be
I worry i am a weaboo...
Sushi is my favorite food and i think anime is alright.
Try me, say one thing about anime!
Looooool this is hilarious
franku, do a rant on bronies. they are the worst cancur, b0ss.
[Comment Retracted]
XD This is so fucking funny, take my katana collection!
I am a cute anime girl
If you can't admit you're a weeaboo, you're probably a weeaboo lmao
i'm not ok with that pocket watch abuse, unless it's quartz
My favorite anime is boku no pico ( Õ°¬∞( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) ñ Õ°¬∞) Õ°¬∞)
bunch of cocaroaches at the end of the vid weird as cunts
I hope all weeaboos get cancer
this is hilarious
why is ff's voice so sexy at the beginning of the video? thank god i know Japanese from the anime i watch, so i could know what he's speaking. It upped the sexiness, honestly
1. Press 3 and 4 repeatedly for Weeaboo porn
2. ???
3. ???
4. Still ???
5. You sick weaboo faggot.
Nanda-__==-.. nanda tetbuyouuoououuooo
His voice is slowly killing me.
He's not 52 is he?
Im not a Weeaboo :( Im an Otaku :(
Weeaboos translates to a 30 year old that jacks off to little girls, right off the bat.
For anyone wondering, he doesn't  "Are you ready to have some fun? I sure am!" Instead he actually says "There are two people in the closet...They're both dead." Fun facts.
I love anime and is not a weeaboo has an anime profile pic and found this hi- fuckin -larious because its so true
Hmm, that's not what the subtitles really said.
lol those hooter girls look so nervous
Laughing so much at this video; He totally nailed the anime voices and when he came out touching his nipples I burst. I am concerned though, because I own a sword collection. I have a 18th century sword mt great grandfather gave  me, a katana (high carbon steal and heat treated), and a model sword from an anime. I just collect them because they are amazing conversation pieces. Especially my antique weapons.
Brittany venti!
Am I the only one who hates weeaboos more than bronies, and furries?





true honestly, I woulden't care if every weeb dropped dead right now, because they make the internet an even worse place, and the world a worse place, because as filthy frank said, "You guys are litterally one of the reasons why parents tell their kids to stay away from strangers"
The comment section is basically a fucking misogyny of a cluster fuck.
Ah, youtube comments. Especially insulting on FF videos.
my favorite anime is chair yup an anime about pudding
Fucks sake, I get outa bed at 4am and this is the first thing I see. Im going back to sleep fuck this shit.
so is this what cosplay is?
This comment section is the best manga.
i watch black lagoon and no ones heard of it, i think its because its too western. To be honest most people into anime are just way too japanophile for their own good i mean black lagoons a good series if you'd just give it a chance you weaboo nutbars
I need to show this to some weebs now, to make the school community better n sh¬°t. Lol.
Is it just me or does the song that Salamander Man played sound like the intro to Welcome to the Black Parade?
cory in the house is my fav anime
My favorite anime is caveman folk stories from the stone age.
WHERE THE SUBTITLES
The slideshow at the end was just sad.
ok, not to sound like a weeaboo XD but what anime was that anime pic from? i actually would like to watch it ^w^
COME AT MEH BRO :3
Before people ask my profile pic is from a video game made in japan. It is Persona 3 FES.
Why did he randomly say sex inverdabres? lol
but I just wanna be yuno so I can chase random boys screaming yukki... .3.
Ok I'm fine with my Canadian culture anyways we have poutine ;D
"caaaaaan somebody gimmie the poosayyy pls?"
this nigga lol
This could also be said about the superwholock fandom
this guy is Chinese? I thought he talked like that all the time
Best weird show...
If you're a japanese! You can't be a weeaboo? Right!?
I lost it when he said " When you buy Japanese weapons you can't even use."
Weeaboos, Bronies, and Pegasisters ARE ALL THE SAME
don't let papa franku get mainstream now he has 1 million subs
Lmao...I watch anime but I ain't craze about it. Like lmao...I don't go around dressing like anime characters and I for sure don't watch it 24/7. This video was pretty funny though but sad to see that people are like 30 and still live with they're parents...watching anime 24/7...without taking showers for weeks....without seeing the daylight.
It was my first day of school today and I said this
Weaboo: What's your favorite anime
Me: Um idk let me think.
Weaboo:....
Me: Oh yeah it was Cory in the House and Toy Story.
Weaboo: that's not an anime your weird
Me: #FilthyFrank
Dragon Ball Z/All dragon ball is a bad and confusing anime, Kill-La-Kill was so much better. (Let's see all the hate on this!)
"In yoir moms attic..." Mmmmh. *Goes to the attic. " DAAD!?!?!?"
rosetta stone
Having an anime profile pic doesn't make you a weeaboo. O.o;
WEEABOOS R US
Me I prefer to be borderline weeaboo, but I still can laugh at the patheticness of all of those pics
anime fucking sucks. thanks for the attention.
Cool.



Bronies next?
Your voice sounds like you drank whiskey for 40 years straight, and you haven't slept in 4 days.
Screw these anime profiled pricks
When I say ''Cartoons = Animes'' Weaboos Attack me.

b0ss help
So he's basically talking about /a/?
I owned a katana along with me morning star mace before I knew about all this shit -_-
2000 weeaboos disliked this video
i've just set up this avatar, but still agree with what you've said so far. i've just gotten into anime however i wouldn't consider myself a fan, nice said frank, i can't stand japanese wannabe's aswell, fucking tards
this also got me dying in laughter
What is the song at 6:43 ?
Best anime is Game of Thrones and Jackass
"And the worst part is, you think you know everything about Japan, like you believe schoolgirls have eyes this big, nobody carries a fucking katana on the train, andnobody practices jutsus in the corner!" Subscribed x 1,000,000
Weeaboos are so annoying
I don't understand why people are like "I've watched more anime then I can count on my hands" they also think the anime is speaking proper japanese but they aren't. They don't even look into the culture "I've watch so much anime I know everything about their culture" lol no you don't.
I have an anime profile pic, yet i'm not a weeaboo. .-. Weaaboo's are weirdo's though.
im a little weeaboo ish but im not anything like that, and the only reason why i would collect katanas would be becuz of the samurai warriors and anyways great video
We are starting a Thomas The Tank Engine group.

Now

I fucking love you frank
my favorite anime is King of the Hill
"Don't talk shit on Attack on Titan. It's a really good show."
This is so on point though. AoT fans can't even realize the flaws in their shitty, overhyped obsession wtf
This is amazing haha
This is probably my favorite Filthy Frank video and I've seen so many damn ones.
"Where are the subtitles"


FUCk
Watashi wa g≈´guru hon'yaku o shiy≈ç shimasu!

I was called a weeaboo a bunch of times by someone who confused someone who likes anime
Mi favurit amine is cory in le hous
I like anime but i'm not a 'weeaboo'
I've wanted to go  to japan before I watched anime
Filthy frank, you sir are my spirit animal.
Straight outta compton was a very good anime movie.
heavy breathing and rapid typing
come on,¬†everybody knows the best 3 animes are Chowder, Little house on the Prarie, and the daily show. What is wrong with you people?!?
They get upset when I point out that animes are cartoons
My research shows that weaboo jones is the first weaboo to ever spread his gank across our big blue earth

Associates of chin chin decided it would be funny to replicate his genetic material

And make more weaboos

Do you know what this means?
Even if we eradicate all anime, they will continue to multiply, and make more autism
We need to take out the source of this stanky infestation, and THEN wipe out the rest, that means destroying weaboo jones's preserved corpse AND the genetic material kept locked away
I finally found a weapon, to surpass the weaboo gear
2:46 That part literally cracked me up xD I'm dying
RIP weeaboo jones
Banana
spongebob is the second best anime
Is that achtully your real voice???
spoiler: weeaboo jones is now in the shadow realm
6:52 PINK GUY? PINK GUY? WHERE ARE YOU?...ey b0ss. XD
Lol, when he's getting shit thrown at him, he yells "yamete, iittai, (insert gay comment)" [stooooop iiit, it hurts, I like gay buttsecks]

Even though you are right on most parts, there is definitly a screw loose in your head....


Also, you are like the same age my dad is.
I scroll down and I see all the faggots with their anime profile pics acting like they're laughing with is. FRANK HATES YOU. But seriously, kill yourselves.
CORY IN THE HOUSE MADE ME A WEEABOO
the real question is,did pink guy survive.
I'm literally Thomas the tank engine, people at school used to call me it, I was all like Ye I am and I'm run you over when you on the train tracks, last thing you'll see is choo choo mother fucker! Plus I get Percy's ass
Love this
LOL funny shit man
So am i a weaboo if i watch a few animes have 2 posters 1 tanto and 1 katana?
I wonder if these fucking weeaboos know what seppuku is. They should really try it out.
The number of people who dont know the difference betwen weeaboo and otaku is too damn high
filthy frank this was your honestly funniest video yet #fuck weaboos
HOLY CRAP I THINK IM A WEABOO
Why does he looks like a bruce lee?
Man, I should go to one "Anime reviewer" who talks and type "Anime sucks" :DDDDD
Pink guy on the bed is the funniest shit in the world.
God damn it I want to own katana and go to Japan I feel like a weaboo .... but thank god I don't think those things and don't own takumara or whatever its called XD
Not all people r weaboos for rosetta ston some tale spanish
What is he doing with his voice? why does it only sound like that when he is not speaking japanese?! I DONT GET IT! HELP ME SOMEONE!"
dirty weaboos
the end of the vid was pure TORTURE like omg XD
2:46 - 2:54. Subbed.
Not trying to be mean or anything but is that your really voice or how you talk?!?!?
so uh this is the first filthyfrank video I watched, and the first half was cool, but then the second half... Since the salamander dude it went downhill... at this point I'm just thinking wtf did I just watch.... Also, does he have no shame? I'm so confused. His neighbors hearing him is a problem but uploading it onto youtube isn't?
WHERE DE SUBTITLES

I died.

Amazing, absoloutely glorious
i cant stand him talking
10:08 That guy isn't a weeaboo...

...he's much, much worse.
People everyone hates in the comment sections(in no particular order)

Weeaboos
Bronies 
Minecrafters 
Self advertisers 
People who copy and paste other people's comments

Add to the list, friends!
Damn y'know if we get to a point where people are like "post-irony isn't funny and you're not as funny as you think you are" then it'd be fair criticism, but when a bunch of underage facebook nerds actually take what they see seriously it just becomes sort of awkward to watch. And now at least half of the "anti-weeaboo" proclamations are satirical themselves and it's getting harder and harder to tell the difference.
Attack on Titan IS a good show!!!!!!!
Cory in the house is the best anime
http://pastebin.com/xgZ0qucc
minecraft is bad
You have way too much free time to be hating on weeaboos
you sadistic asshat
Did anyone hear his voice crack at 0:21
We support prejudice equality
damn that pigeon should of shit on your face
OTAKU'S should flag this Video because most of theses stuff are not true and there different kinds of Anime fans ok
That ending though... XD
we are not weeboos we are OTAKU'S
Can someone explain what are those "girl pillows"? Some kind of imaginary girlfriends?
Where did this guy go
Those weaboo pictures really creep me out
I may be a weaboo... but I really don't get mad when people make fun of anime, it doesn't bother me

So intense...
I am going to be 100% serious FF, you saved me from becoming a weeaboo and i will forever thank you for this video. You have truly helped me and i will always remember this video so that i know what i should not¬†become.
every time I watch FF videos I have to keep an eye on the volume just in case he starts moaning... people are gonna think I'm watching porn or something
If you have to explain to people why youre not weeaboo, its probably because youre a weeaboo.
I don't see them around much in England-they must thrive more in habitats more proficient in fast food like America.
you fucking suck stop making videos

I like the merchandise, I like japan, and I like anime a lot. What I DONT like is that people like little girls having sex, and body pillows and stuff like that. I will admit, I do want to learn japanese, but not because I want to be like a japanese person, it's just that I'm lazy to read subtitles. So yeah...
4:09 best part xD

Im learning japanese now and my class is full of weeaboos its so sad :(. One of them only talks about going to japan in 2 months to marry and have childrens with a japanese girl he found on skype 3 months ago.The lvl of imagination some weeaboos have is outstanding.
I don't consider myself a weeb but I get it a-fucking-lot and it pisses me off...
"I know how to use chopsticks, I know Hiragana..."  weeaboos at their worst XD

"i'm not a weeaboo I'm an otaku" Fug
What the kuso did you just say about anime, you baka gaijin? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my kurasu in chuunibyou, and I‚Äôve been winkingly oblivious to numerous secret raids on my pantsu, and I have over 300 confirmed fanboy nosebleeds. I am trained in cosplay fanservice and I‚Äôm the most popular character on the entire show. You are nothing to me but just another baka hentai. I will wipe you the uguu out with fanservice the likes of which has never been seen before in this time slot, mark my ra-ri-ru-re-ro words. You think you can get away with being that ecchi to me over the Internet? Think again, baka. As we speak I am contacting my himitsu network of spies across the classroom and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, aho. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your social life. You‚Äôre going to die of embarrassment, gaki. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can humiliate you in over nana hundred ways, and that‚Äôs before my transformation sequence. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of body pillows and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable niko off the face of the continent, you hentai. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have kept shizuka, ara ara. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you triple baka. I will unleash moe all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre going to sleep, gaki.
According to every Weeaboo  Japanese=Japanese Chinese=Japanese Korean=Japanese

I'm an otaku and I even find this funny XD
Weaboos are annoying as hell
This should be shown in all public schools
Everyone wants Harold's ass.
was that pbg?
I heard you were talking shit about my avatar.
Thomas the "Tank" Engine üòÇüòÇüòÇ

This guy is amazing XD
Weeaboo Jones had me dying.
Not all animes are bad. Take Corey in the house for example.
I love ur voice, it makes me feel so itchy :3
Filthy Frank is better than drugs and eating feces.
Can I just say this channel is so amazing and beautiful! Bless you filthy frank for having this channelüíô
Papa franku makes me happy
can someone tell me what he says from 0:09 to 0:15?
NYA-ISS!
Best anime is the anaconda music video jeez guys get with it.
1:33 My favorite. <3
Frank, you CAN be a train, just ask HitlersPimp, he has achieved such a goal!
I have an anime profile pic and I'm not a weeaboo
How do you blindfold a Japanese person? Put floss over their eyes.
Come at me WEEABOOS
"I live in my moms house, I'm like 32." xD WE LIKE ALL THE SAME ANIME
I don't have dreams, i don't have smoke coming off my ass, i dont deserve to live. Bye everyone
I studied Japanese language and culture for two years because I respect their culture, not cause I'm a weab XD
FRANKU I WILL GET YOU! I WILL STRIKE WITH A BIGGER ARMY NEXT TIME
Would you kill all¬†

Weebs, but Japan sinks under a tsunami
Furrys, but owning a pet becomes illegal
Bronys, but vehicles cease to exist and must ride horses
CoDs, but all guns/gun-like objects are turned into wood
Geeks, but Star Wars and any other geek shows/movies cease to exist
Pedos, but all underaged kids now look like small old people
Hippies, but marijuana ceases to exist
Hipsters, but glasses ceases to exist
Hobos, but you must not be far from a home for more than a day or you die
Hair stylists, but everyone on Earth is now bald, astronauts in space are safe
Heart surgeons, but human hearts now dangle outside the body like a pair of testicles

you can pick 2, 3 if you are one of these "things"
I fucking lost it at Cory in the house
We get it. You weeaboos are pedophiles... Just leave deviant art alone and go to your dark side of tumblr
Then there's the weeaboos who claim they aren't... The worst weeaboos are the ones that become homosexual or change their gender because of anime... Too many goddamn trannies at my school and they're multiplying... DAMNA YOU CATRYNN JENNERUE
I have to lower down the volume my parents think I'm watching hardcore japanese porn.
My uncle gave me a Shuriken key chain that was meant to give luck to the owner or something. Despite losing it.. Does that make me a weeaboo?
i love this video so much, i fucking love entire channel XD
4k from this amazing video frank wins life
You earned a subscription!
EY b0ss, ta f0king nerds r here...#Hashtag
SO MANY WEABOOS IN THE COMMENTS
I'm the only one in my Japanese class that isn't there because of Anime, Manga, or whatever the fuck else Japanese cartoons there are.
This is so wong in so many levels... Me and my waifu are both really mad right now.
It's super ironic that while you make fun of weeaboos there is no way that your normal speaking voice is this deep you aren't 100 percent American yet you try to sound as though you are and it's just as annoying as overweight closet homosexuals going out and worshiping my little pony you and them are the same diseased pieces of human trash please do the rest of the world a favor and opt out of breeding because the last thing we need is more fucktards like you
any anime made by Tyler perry is top notch
cory in the white house s2
2:37 Thanks for teachin' everyone something, Frank. We all have dreams, but there is a time where it goes too far. I wanted to be a car from, well, Cars, but that didn't happen. I wanted to be a superhero in Super Why!, but that shit never happened! Just wanted a piece of Wonder Red's ass, you know? lol jk about all that but thanks 4 teaching everyone this.
This is the only video I have disliked from you.
laughing my head off at the video

Hahaha good shit. I watch Animes myself, mainly One piece and a few other popular ones. The gory ones are the best :D
anime peoples these days
this guy sound so high!
I don't get how non-anime fans can hate anime fans just because of some ironical video. I mean, even the ones you hate don't get mad at them, why would you do this? Anyway, watching anime as a hobby is ok, but I beg you, don't come talking to me like "Hey, yesterday I found this neko and it was so KAWAIIIII-DESU" please no...
So I like zelda and kingdom hearts. I also have a replica of the keyblade and the master sword. But they aren't anime. So am I a Weeaboo or no?
The Weeaboo protection chamber had me in stitches.
I'm weeaboo scum, this is funny af üòÇüòÇ

Frank uses an anime picture, tho
Spongebob Squarepants is the best anime.
Frank probably knows more Japanese than every Weeaboo combined.
I like Corey in the house.
You have two dead fat people in your closet? That's what he really said in the intro, lol
Oh, a pigeon. Dat focus doe.
The thing I hate the most is when people confuse passionated anime fans with weaboos.

Corey in the House lol.
This is one of my favorites of Filthy Franks.
Wait, you watched TTTE to? Far out....
Weeaboos are the reason that I don't tell people I watch anime because theyll think I sleep with a body pillow and think I'm Japanese

Frank's Japanese voice near the start sounds so cool... Not the language itself but the tone.
SPREAD THE WOOOOOORD
XD My fucking sides right now!
This video had me in tears XD
But I don't see how liking weapons is red flagish?
I do however see the "katana cultists" as very cringe worthy.
Thinking the Katana is the "ultimate weapon of the gods" or some retarded shit.
I'M EFFIN SCREAMING
this was the most funniest anti weaboo video in history like I watch anime but I would not go far to where I dress up and do cosplay like fuck that shit
There's a girl at my school who is fat as fuuuuck and she is a Weeaboo.... I mean, her Facebook pic is her in her room with all her Anime shit..

Filthy frank has just brought justice to the internet in the fight against weeaboos.

I'm not sure what's worse, furrys or weaboos.
Lost it at Cory in the house
I LIKE ANIME. grabs popcorn
I have to agree with this. Everyone who sees this is going to think that I'm just some white kid who is trying to look like I'm fucking Japanese...but I'm willing to bet that's 90% of the people who see this. But white people shouldn't be like that about anime and Japanese culture.
dont talk shit about attack on titan its a really good show
My brother is actually in love with you & your youtube channel & honestly idk why anyone would like you, you're pretty annoying and offensive...(and I would say more but I'm not mean like that lol)
Anime does suck ass
GOKU WOULD TOTALLY KICK SUPERMAN'S ASS
ATTENTION, WEEBFAGS!¬†












SAO is an alright anime, and Evangelion is overrated trash.¬†


Oh and anime is, by definition, a form of cartoon.

fite me.

I wish the holocaust happens again but instead of jews they burn people who watch anime. Come on Germany make it happen.
To me going to Japan is And thinking All Japanese Anime steroytypes Or anything you learned from anime And yelling "BANKAI, RESENGON", anything regarding that is like being a nerd and out of place it's like yelling "Super man FTW VS GOKU SSJ YEAH FUCK YOU GOKU" "SPIDER MAN SPIDER MAN WEB SLINGER INGAGE" my point is hey I love anime but if I ever learn Japanese it will be threw hard work and if I wanted to go to Japan I would not just go on anime And manga I would go on every thing I can learn from my library and the all knowing Internet
Fuckin' Japs!
Holy shit toy story and the airplane instructions are the best anime created in the whole fucking world
Omfg this is perfect!!!
I have strayed to the dark side of the web, im going to leave the internet

I'm not a weeaboo but goddamn did Japan make cool shit in the feudal era.
One time I saw a weaboo try to go inside my house, I then got my jewish friend to beat the shit out of him with a gun that was used by Hitler himself.
I pray to Chin-Chin that everyone here realizes this comment section has essentially become the Ratchet Realm that Frank has warned us of. Holy fuck.
first!1!1

Weeaboo
Definition:
Someone who abandons their own culture and fails to join another.
A rouge, cultureless faggot.
I only talk to age /appropriate/ people. Not those adult stinky adult sailor moon displaying weirdos. When I'm talking with my ethnic group, I can't talk 3 minutes without having an adult say "SHUT THE FUCK ABOUT (some anime series)" And then he starts following us. I swear to god the next time that happens I'm calling the cops.
I didn't know Percy was a boy till till last year
the most depressing thing on the internet weaboos our worst nightmare
anime sucks oh no there coming!!!!!!
+TVFilthyFrank

You May all Debate between Cory and the 80s airplane construction manual videos (which are still great animes) ¬†but only a few people here have the right Idea. SEINFELD TRUMPS ABOVE All OTHER ANIMES. And I'm not just Talking Trump Trump, but Donald Trump expensive level of trumping, Were Talking A solid gold, Platinum plated, diamond encrested type of trump garnished with the blood of the mistreated innocent workers who built it. You can tell it's a pretty serious trump. Just stop and think for a moment about Kramer, the greatest anime hero of all time. In episode 17 of season 9 (the bookstore) Kramer uses advanced psycological warfare tactics to convince Newman (the greatest anime enemy of all time) that he would be safe riding in a rickshaw being pulled by kramer himself. However he was unaware that Kramer had planned otherwise as he was able to release the rickshaw down a hill hospitalizing an innocent man, but taking down Newman at the same time. Has there ever been an anime battle as epic as that? NO. The only thing that comes close is the battle at the conclusion of the two part story spread between episodes 21 and 22 of season 7 (The Bottle Deposit) in which Kramer hunts down Jerry's automechanic Tony in a mailtruck full of thousands of bottles and one Newman. In the final battle Kramer was in his mail truck was following Tony at a dangerously close distance while dodging John F. Kennedy's golf clubs that Elaine won at an auction which Tony was throwing at him. Eventualy Tony was able to land the winning blow on the mail truck as he threw a driver club at the tire immobilizing Kramer. Even though he was not able to capture Jerry's stolen car from Tony, Kramer was able to retrieve JFK's $20,000 golf clubs so that Elaine could give them to Mr. Peterson. There is no anime fight in history that even compares to those two masterpieces of script. Along with that legendary original soundtrack, SEINFELD IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE BEST ANIME. Dislike if you think that George Costanza is not Kawaii.
Dude what's with you're voice, sorry if I'm out of the loop
Roses are red, violets are blue, the title was in english.....wait nevermind

Can we all please take a moment and praise this greasy, filthy, disgusting, amazing man. This mother fucker invented the fucking Harlem Shake, put weeaboos on blast, raps in like 3 different personas, and has made fun of topics that other people wouldn't dare to even touch. I love you frank. Please have my children ;)
I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass, you know...
smoke weebs every day
All these weeaboos defending their weeabooness thinking they're JoJo's Bizarre Adventure badass when they're not even Boku no Pico badass
I had seen a lot of people talk about this like it was really offensive on different pages and whatnot before I had even seen the video so I thought you were insulting everyone who watches anime. But when I watched it and I discovered that you actually gave the correct definition of a weeaboo and stated multiple times that someone can still like and watch anime and it doesn't mean that they're automatically a weeaboo... I subbed. :D Even if you are fucking crazy and weird, your videos make me laugh uncontrollably because of their weirdness.
LOL... I like pumpkin pie
So you would agree that the term "transracial" is complete bullshit and the white "leader" of the NAACP who claimed to be that term is totally dumb? I absolutely agree!!!!!!!
My favorite anime is also Corey in the house and Seinfeld

Sigh....I just don't know anymore.

I'm about to start a lawsuit against the New York school system for discrimination.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA OH JESUS I DIED WHEN HE WAS DOING THE VOICE IMPRESSIONS
I just like anime... I don't collect any of that crap. I just buy the t shirts if they look cool. So I'm not really a weeaboo at all am I ?
This video deserves much thanks
why is your nose oddly shaped?
And then there's bronies.......
Solrflare is a weaboo

Rosetta Stone
dude go to hospital and fix your voice
hello my name is cowboy tanaka 5:11
These Weeaboos are like those little pony loving faggets. No successful people are into this weird shit, but I guess if I was a loser I'd need to pretend I was something I wasn't to get away from the shitty reality these freaks live in. They are cancer to society but luckily, I surround myself with individuals who are doing things with their life, these types of scum hang out with other trash, you can tell the type by just looking at them, pathetic really. You be you though virgins, next time you wonder why you are laughed at by others and aren't shit in life look in the mirror.
Man...And people said that Bronies are¬†weird...They're kind of right but we're not as¬†weird as weeaboos.
Most anime is mediocre and many don't realize that.
I'm borderline weeaboo and this hit close to home. But this gave me a pretty good laugh. Good on you for the full on equal hate, wouldn't have any other way.
Um, shitlord? The fuck is with this kinkshaming you cis male scum??? I identify as a 8 year old japanese loli with cat ears and frankly this is really ableist and discriminatory. My kitana is so sharp it can slice through my mountain dew bottle in ONE STROKE, you better watch the fuck out kiddo. You're now enemy #1
There was not a moment during this whole video that I wasn't almost pissing my pants from laughing too hard. good work.
I find this channel so funny as he criticize society and doesn't give a shit about negative response he gets from people just too funny. People just have a stick up their ass so they think it not funny as its crude humor.
snoop dogg is my waifu
Everybody wants to be Japenese, unless its august,1945
im not a weeaboo i am an oktakoo therefore less of a failure

my parents think im a failure, but, i don't need them...i have my cats and my bodypillow.

Damn I have a sword, I only have that cause ima Zelda fan, I watch a lot of action anime too, guess ima weaboo üòü
ALL WEEABOOS SHOULD BE LYNCHED BY THE STATE.
to be honest im not a big fan of katakanas i like claymores much more no matter how big a fan of anime i am
Oh my god, that impression of an anime character talking was hilarious and spot on.
What's with all these shit tier anime waifus?
Which anime should I watch? Cory in the House or Shrek?
Salamander Man is my husbando
The best anime ever is the filthy frank show
how filthy is filthy frank? c;
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i agree i have little cousins who watch that shit and try to get me interested its fuckin horrible
Every anime is the gayest shit on the planet

//grabs popcorn
How much does a guy have to pay for a Seinfeld anime? I'm just gonna wait.

Pretty fucking accurate XD
weaboos and wiggers must die
Friends is a good anime.
my favorite anime is spongebob

"Anime was a mistake" -Hideki Tojo

I looked up cory in the house and this shit came up, all I wanted was my fucking cory in the house bitch .... (btw I clicked on the video because I liked his wig fucking fabulous )
I found one boys. At my high school there's a kid that now goes by "Rin" and grew his hair out and refuses to shower. Will only wear one shirt and it's a picture of an anime girl.
fuck me this shit is hilarious
I'm a potato and I am offended by this... (jk)
Brony's Are Worst.
you would make a pretty good voice actor for anime
I personally collect swords and knives. Not limited to katana. I just find that a good knife is like a work of art. So collecting knives and swords doesn't make you fucked up. But then again there is something to say for my mental state.
y is called webo, lol weird,weird name
omg you ruined my lifeXD
How to start a fight:

1. Write this
2. Wait for people to respond
+Angelthehedgehog1¬†WEEABOO TRAAAASH
Its like 8000th time im watching this masterpiece its fucking amazing. Filthyfrank is the next messiah. 
Weaboos are disgusting, we dont want those crap in japan. Get the fuck away from our land.
I'm a weeaboo but I love this video and don't think its offensive unlike some. Makes my tiny tsundere self giggle~
Frank, I think you just offended Hank Sasaki, who thanks god for country music. It's the sound that comes straight from the heart, you know.
Looks through comment section to find weeaboos in their natural habitat breathing heavily clicking hate on their 1990's computer keyboard*
http://oi60.tinypic.com/2jfzplg.jpg
His facial expressions are so funny
BTW, I prefer dubbed anime. Preferably edited dubs on cable TV.
Weaboos be like:


Turning japanese

I think im turning japanese

I really think soooo
Report video>child abuse
Attack on titan is anal cancer
Cory in the House is the best anime ever HANDS DOWNS
These Chinese cartoons are for kids
These Chinese cartoons are for kids
IS THIS WHERE THAT GODDAMN CORY IN THE HOUSE AND SEINFELD ANIME MENE COMES FROM
I consider myself a weeaboo
minus the America bashing japan praising thing.
I still found this funny
not sure why you guys are so pissed
"who put a giant rasengan up your ass"
"oh shit my parents heard that"
I'm guilty of the 13 year old anime girl thing but that joke still made me laugh (and be ashamed of myself)
also really laughed when the pidgeon hit the glass and started croaking
and when his neighbors heard his anime/Asian girl impression
7:45
those mongekyou sharingan and the "RASENGAN" put me in tears
your awesome frank but my brother is a weeaboo hes in the early stage how do i prevent him from fully turning
My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is my favorite anime.
He wouldn't be half bad as an anime voice actor.......
why the fuck did this show up as a recommendation of "politics"?
lol all the butthurt people
I cried. Fuck this video. I laughed so fucking hard I cried. Fuck Weeaboos.
weaboos are fucking cancer hope they all die
Curious George is my favorite anime :^)
Holy shit your right
Hoodwinked is the best anime
Your voice is like batman's voice but at a higher pitch
Those Misty cosplayers actually made me reel back when I saw them. So did that guy in the Kill la Kill cosplay. Ew. Just fucking ew!
Cory in the house was my shit, you got taste Frank.
Shrek and shrek 2 and shrek 3 and shrek 4everafter are tye best animes
Sometimes you look like a frog.
9:05 R.I.P Game √ñstersund
Death grips is the best meme rap
Polandball> everything
im an otaku.
the japanese word kind of otaku.
not anime fan, but youll see.
Wow I can't believe people would actually change their profile pictures to anime pictures what fags ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Is that... Chris Chan at 10:08
Screw you. I`m a panda with a collection of a LOT of swords.
You're channel is hilarious!! If I ever had a channel, yours would definitely inspire mine. Keep up the good work!
The sad part is like a solid 70% of this is true.
Can a Japanese person be a weeaboo??
Can I get some Cory amvs? I found some but I want more:p
Holy shit! This video made me laugh Papa Franku. Thanks for the laugh!
Billy mays created anime by taking a shit and out came anime
I'm like, a normal anime fan...
wtf is wrong with WEEABOOS i hate japan i know i have not gone there but still if i went to japan i think the food there would get me sick in minutes well except for the noodles i love ramen but still i would not want to go there and so many guys are acting like girls there parents probably think there a disgrace to their family i'm okay with them doing this just like Filthy Frank  said don't get it near me
sees the hate WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.remember kids filthy frank and pun-tang should rule your life not the love for anime and hentai my friends.you can like anime my children but leave the god status love to pink guy.then you shall live the perfect life(brought to you by the church of filthy frank)
Furies,please rant and rave about furies XD
i enjoy anime, but i heard that Hayao Miyazaki was going to stop making his films because otakus keep sexualizing the female protagonists,  like Kiki or Laputa and he finds it disgusting. He doesn't want to make other movies because fans might sexualize the characters. I don't mind weeaboos and otakus, but when they take it too far, as to make a great director wanting to stop his own job, they should really cut it out.
It's not just anime it's games that are in japanese as well.
So¬†many people I want to show this to.
Ayy lmao.
Donald Trump will make anime real
cory in the house is an gr8 anime,






nigga weaboos, theyre everywhere
fuck you i love to watch anime and im proud bitch i can be what i want to be and i love watching anime and shit and yea maybe i have some posters with anime girls on them but i dont make out with them and shit i maye have dropet ou t of high school but im always love anime and fyi i can speak japanese pretty fluently so ye ur a dumbass an ur weird as fuk lol
"I just wanted a piece of Percy's arse, you feel me?" ^^ loool Kappa
More like a weeab0ss
anime
You know this guy is good when he doesn't even have a Mil sub but gets 4 mil veiws! Too good!!!
So nobody is gonna talk about the fact that he sounds like a japanese voice actor
every new friend i make i send this video, and if they disagree with one single thing franku says, then we are no longer friends.
New weeboo fag argument typed while heavy nose breathing - "uh u guys assume everi1 ho waches animi is a weeaboo" huur hurr hurr now evribudy wil think I'm not a filty weeaboo
Anime sucks and should be taken down and all the weeaboos should be charged with war crimes, and felonies. Along with all the Bronys, Furries, and Justin Beiber. 

Let the hate games BEGIN!!!
Man, the backyardagins Is the best anime there is.
This comment section triggered my Vietnamese flashbacks
Yogi bear was the best anime ever

Right next to thunder cats, and spongebob

Btw ANIME SUCKS
Filthy Frank sounds like he's chocking on a litre of honey. Fuck weeboos, I want a piece of the helicopters ass.
yeah those Japanese cartoons are so silly
I'm an otaku. I just like the culture and anime. :)
It's funny how people think anime watchers are weeaboos
I know you're just jealous because you can't be a weebo.
Where are the weeaboos to protect their lives #weeaboo hater
I wonder how watchable Frank would be without his jump cuts.
Jersey Shore
Judge Judy
Brazzers
King of the Hill
16 and pregnant
Steve Jobs
Mc Donalds

A list of my favorite animes
9/11 was such a great anime movie. Gosh I wish they made a series :(
I love your accents bro XD you got ¬†+1 sub x)
3:15 cracked me up LOL
Avatar: The Last Airbender is the best anime.
That's right everyone! If you say one word bad about anime i will fuck you up, you hear that!
Wonder who would win in a fight, an otaku or a weeaboo? Just imagine them hitting each other with anime pillows. Lol.
The thing I hate the most about weeaboos is how they wish Japan won the war. Like, pick up a fucking history book, WW2 Japan deserves 0 respect from anynone.
I fucken love your content. Now go set yourself on fire. Byatchhhhhh!
best shit ever
The cowboy weeaboo part. "Herro, my name is-uh cowboy haraka."
I'm not a Weaboo. But I cosplay and watch anime. But people don't understand why we outcasts of a broken community(Life) watch Anime.

grabs Lounge Chair

Fite me.
anime is alright.
Damn it. I scroll down into this comment section hoping to find some weeaboo trying to defend themselves. Disappionted
Frank breaking character is my favorite thing
I have a Ak-47 collection, I own 25 bottles of vodka, I sing the Russian national anthem every morning, I own 10 Ushanka's, a bear coat, play Tetris all day, and Vladmir Putin is my waifu!!!! 
WISH ME LUCK IN RUSSIA!!!!
I really like that one Korean animation, wizards of waverly place
God bless Filthy Frank and his wisdom. :'^)

Its funny because in Japan, apparently, people who are like weeaboos are considered shut ins, no life's and are shunned by society and are basically the scum of their nation.
Few! Thought I was being categorised but then I don't do most of the stuff you mentioned.. So yaaah
Weeaboos gather around and prepare to yell at this guy from ur mom's basement! #get a reality check
Guys you wanna see my sword collection?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
They should make a similar word for whom try to be american
anime sucks
When safariman says "We have to run!" He actually says "I love pussy!" 

Safariman plz. I'm not a weeaboo. I'm Japanese so no spammerinos

You could be a voice actor for anime.
Hey baws
5:36, if that shit doesn't make you all warm and fuzzy inside you can fuck right off
Good day sir are you the cause why Cory in the house become an anime?? Sorry for ma englishit
A couple of months ago a guy in my English class showed me this video after he found out I was into anime. And never have I laughed so hard to the point my stomach hurt. I am so glad I was introduced to filthy frank. And I keep coming back to this video and it still gets to me. :D
I do have an Anime character on my profile picture on Facebook but no, im not like them. I am not fat and i do not smell bad xD
HOW ARE YOU 52?!?!?!? YOU LOOK TO YOUNG TO BE 52 STOP CONFUSING ME WITH YOUR AGE
I don't wanna like his videos but I'm laughing so hard
i always called them inchiki gaijins........
I may have a hentia picture but, I am not a weeaboo ;D
I used to be a weeaboo, but I have changed, I was never fat though :D but I shall never go back to being a weeaboo, although I still watch attack on titan, cause that show is good.
There is only one "anime" movie I liked in my life, it was princess mononoke ;p never got interested in anything else
Woah, You just described me perfectly. Good job.
Well the only thing you got wrong is that saying attack on titan is a good show does not make you a weeaboo lol
You are so funny, you make day everyday. Thnx frank your awesome.
Wow that was fucking awesome. You need your own TV show.
Schindler's List is my favourite anime
I have an anime account and when I post on it I don't mix English amd Japanese I only use English I'm no weeb
Those fucking weebs need to learn to speak proper English or proper Japanese, instead of knowing only 2 words smh -_-
OmF so listen. If you go on instagram and go to an account with the word kawaii in it, they have anime post which is okay. BUT... if you to a post and look at the comments, all you would see are weeaboos saying weeaboo things. The one that makes me mad the most is when they mix English and Japanese. For example since you can tag people on a post they can say thank you. But those stupid weebs will be all like "Arigato for the tag!" WHO THE FUCK MIXES JAPANESE AND ENGLISH? or weebs will be like "miku is so kawaii!" or "This is so kawaii!" I don't even like miku but thats not the point. Weebs are so annoying I mean it's like me going out in public and saying "Ohayo everyone!" or "Konnichiwa everyone!" I mean people would think I'm weird. OmF
I think the Japanese candy Pocky is good (not amazing 8/8 gr8 m8). But I feel that if you were to rename it "Choco-Sticks" and make the exact same product in the U.S. all of the weeabos would stop buying it.
This guys voice is too much.
+Janan Nimer¬†omfg this is hilarious
XD omfg im so happy i just enjoy anime and not worship it
When is cowboy tanaka?!
Is that his real voice?
I would enjoy the videos if you didn't do that voice. It annoys me and I get even more annoyed cuz I can't watch the video because the voice annoys me... Seems bout right...
I know from experience that all weeaboos are assholes, but they pretend to be cheerful and accepting just so they don't get hated on, SKY FALL.
http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=172305957¬†¬†
Made this for you Frank. Hope you like it!!
my existence screams weaboo yet I am pleased by this
I'm slowly building up a collection of crossbows and halberds...does that make me a Medievaphile? :(
you are 52? horry shituu :o
3:24 dat breathing tho

I hate japan they should sink. I hate dirty japs. I hate hentai and anime, its nasty.

Grabs popcorn.
Saw a twit in full cosplay at an Obon festival. You have to wonder what's going through someone's head to show up and think, "I'm going as an anime character to this religious thing. Seems legit yo."
"I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass."
0:19 i died..
switched to my porn tab while watching this when my mom walked in it was easier to explain

I do agree Seinfeld is a good anime, but I have to say the suite life of Zach and Cody is the best anime BY FAR.
I fucking died. I had no idea you were this stupid and funny lmao. but you right on with this shit
Anime is stupid, it's all poorly animated, bunch of unimportant episodes to waste lifetime and not to mention all the cliches, holy shit everything is a cliche in anime.
he doesn't look bad for 52
Oh fuck they're everywhere.
EDIT: 2,000 dislikes are all weeaboos
lol just because i went to japan and bought swords bcuz of anime doesnt mean im a weeaboo...
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
+Nathaniel Emm¬†I can't believe I'm just now watching this for the first time. This is the guy that started the whole "Cory in the House is the best anime" meme! RESPECT.
This. Was. Fucking. Hilarious. I've watched this video at least 19 times.

Cory in the House, BEST ANIME EVER
Does it make me a weeaboo if I watch all the dragon ball animes and dispose all others (I know I spelt stuff wrong I don't care)
Is he like half Japanese??
I was going to write Filthy Frank a remix about the "ohh nobody gives a shit" line. It's so funny that I think it's a great idea to turn it into a remix.
Does he do that voice for comedy or is that his real voice

Chief keef is the best anime.
The greatest part about these katana collections(to me, at least),¬†is that they're not even good blades. As an enthusiast¬†for weapons in general, I find this hilarious. And the fact that these people hardly know ANYTHING about these swords is even better.
im so fucking lucky im not a weeaboo o-o i like anime but i really dont want to be the anime
for months on end i have been being harassed by my faggotass subscribers to check out your god damn videos and i am so happy i finally did. jesus fuck. you are hilarious.
Frank you the god or secon to chin chin
genius
My favorite anime is Little Boy and Fat Man go to Japan
Anime is an art form, a show isn't inherently superior just because of the way it's drawn.
My favorite anime is 9/11 footage
LETS FIGHTING LOVE!
If you don't wanna get cancer, don't scroll down.
It's full of weeaboo trash ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Is it wrong that the first thing I do when taking a shit is go to your channel and watch your videos?
#PowerToTheDictators ¬† Fuck Fullscreen
Follow your dreams, son.
in Poland we have so many of them! They're like a disease to human kind! Weeaboo Jones help!
Well at least they're not 5 year old minecraft fanboys with their skin as their profile pic
What about those fur fags aka furries
So does that make me a Weeaboo if I like anime?
2:38
Thomas The Dank Engine
To all Weeaboos
¬†Don't take this seriously. It's just a joke. I am not a Weeaboo myself but calm yourselves. It's just a fucking joke.
I love this guy. Please don't stop. This is awesome.
LMFAOOOOO I'm border-line weeaboo. xD
Fuck anime too
I honestly don't give a shit of you or anyone hates anime
Like if I see a comment "I hate anime" 
I'll think in my head "and I care why?"
Filty Frank is modern day genius.
So much inspiration and inlightment.
Damn,this man is my role model
All of us otakus gotta admit that some of this is pretty fucking true xD
Lol what he said on intro. I dont know what a yudaijin is but why do you have to of them dead in your closet?
Quite the contrary Japanese people like learning English just as much as we like learning Japanese and I see nothing wrong with it! - Ty from a half Korean.

9:44 that chick is hot though
I like the video and I hate weeaboos, but can you sound a little less obnoxious?
This guy is one of few that can make me laugh
Wow. A lot of the people in this video are legitimately disturbing. At 21, I¬†haven't watched anime in¬†four years¬†because it drives me insane. Shitty plots, ridiculous and overdramatic¬†characters, it's just all together weird. How people can be THAT crazy about it is mind boggling. I'll stick to my Top Gear, Seinfeld, Frasier, Comedians in Cars getting Coffee, and pride in being Irish-American, and leave the weird shit to other people.
Attack on titan is actually pretty shit,
What a great first impression.
The weeaboo protection chamber should've been outside
I like how FilthyFrank just made a whole video about weaboos and the comment section is like the last stage of hell
Adult swim status fukin boss foreal
Safari Man is my waifu.
breathes heavily HOW DARR YOU MAK FUN OF MAI WAIFUSSS!!!!1!!!!! (sarcasam)
i thought i was a weaboo but i have no idea how to speak japanese
lol wees and poos
Tell ms please why he's subs are just fukin hilarious
WEEABOOS AINT SHIT BUT CREEPS AND PEDOS
This is the reason why I dislike anime.
I don't give a damn what you think about your culture. If you're an anime nerd, you're a boring fucking person and you should kill yourself. Fucking weaboo. I bet this filthy frank cock sucker is a closet weaboo, the way he intersperses japanese with his hoarse voiced jibberish. He probably fucked his voice up by trying to suck too many japanese miro penises.
I don't get it. What's the difference between anime and cartoons?
2062 little donuts, hidding in mom's attic, found this offensive.
Cory in the house best anime ever. #truth
Hey, I wanna see you blow up Furries. Even as one, I'm like full-tilt waiting to see how hard you bash. I'm so fucking ready!
i don't see a problem with collecting weapons
I love anime a lot, but Weebs creep the hell out of me most of the time. just depends on how creepy they are about liking Japanese culture.
my favorite anime is probably Scoobydoo
Damn son.
Dude. All I wanted was a definition of the word weeaboo and then you show up, and speak so intensely about it.






I LOVE IT
fuck this guy is the greatest man alive
I just noticed how many of them there are
WEEABOO'S R DISGUSTING ASSHOLES
heavy breathing
Cool video
Friends is an awesome anime
Weeaboo and proud.except I'm not gunna be living with my parents at the age of moving on in life...love ur vids.just saying
Oh shit. I just realized that one of my friends is a major time weeaboo.
I hate anime and anime fans.

*grabs popcorn*
You made me fucking day sir XDDD
0:09-0:15 ¬†

Someone call the cops
Bible black best anime overall
I totally applaud .you you are awesome for putting this out here.üëèüëèüëèüëè I'm going to send this to my weeaboo friend not even really my friend
9:48 it's black filthy frank
I bet this fellow has an excellent presentation skill irl. That sure is useful for school and work
HEBOS! (^3^)
Am I a Weaboo because i watch Cory in the house every day and i have a cory collection in my room
ayy b0ss
WHY IS YOUR VOICE LIKE THAT
I was once called a weeabo because I mentioned an anime character under a totally not fitting video.Though I am actually kind of in progress of learning japanese soo..Whatever I'm still not a weeabo I think
even steam bots have anime pics. THE END IS NIGH!
4:11 - 4:20 üòÇüòÇüòÇ
My favorite animes are Mike and Molly, modern family, and brazzers
My favorite anime is Everybody Loves Raymond
Honestly I like anime, but I don't go full on anime merchandise,  try to be Japanese, and all of that crap. But I do want to go to Japan SO BADLY! For the food, culture, AND GODZILLA! But with that makes me have to learn Japanese (oh joy)
I felt so bad for the people in the last pictures.
9:45 the girl is cute
ive not laughed so hard at a youtuber for sooo looong.. thankyou filthy frank!! s-s-s-subbeeddd
What I wonder is when Frank put a picture of Chris-Chan here at 10:10, did he mean to do that on purpose to make fun of Chris or was this just some random picture he found on google not knowing this is Chris but it looked funny.
"RE: RE: Weeaboos: FilthyFrank". Make it happen.
i lost at 5:10, thats it XD
Dang i bought a katana xD it's fake and it's yasuo's katana from league of legends ( it's not an anime by the way) xD
I have a katana collection. But I don't wanna be Japanese and I don't read mongas. I dont know how to use chopsticks. The only two languages. Portuguese and English.
This is why I don't watch anime.
Everything should be taken in moderation.
Just saying.
theres nothing wrong wrong with collecting weapons lol. i have, like three sword, katanas. and i use them in training, because its just a hobby of mine lol.
How many stabs to the leg does it take to kill a man? With a dull blade :)
Ïñ∏Ïñ¥Ïùò Ïû•Î≤Ω
What kind of fucking idiot uses an anime avatar?
You uneducated shits, club penguin is the best anime
Anime fucking sucks.
He said there are two people in my closet and then he said they are both dead

i just wanted a piece of percy's ass, you feel me?
quick ? frank, is it consitered being a weeaboo to be against dubbed? because alot of people i know are, but im not, so yeah
I am having diarrhea, why do my balls hurt.
Lmao
my favorite vietnamese cartoons is pulp fiction
At 9:17.... That moment you realize your life is so fucked up its no use going back...
After watching your video, I realized that I was a weeaboo. Everything you said about me was true. You had opened my eyes to the ill of my ways, and I wanted to stop. Since then, I have really cut down on the anime. I actually lost like 10 pounds now. I broke up with my Japanese fiancee. By next month I will be officially moved out of my parents house. Thank you Frank. You turned my life around.
+Rem Clavis
This is funny as shit because its true

Everyone has an Anime profile pic, and they're saying they're not mad.¬†
You dirty fucks know you were already breathing heavy even before this video started.
3:54 lol
Lol when people say they're an otaku, even though "otaku" is Japanese for no-life geek.
I need feminism because my body-pillow deserves rights , too
Do not drink cacao and watch this at the same time!
On a serious note... I need one Katana.. I got a Flamberge, some straight swords.¬† But  I need me¬† more weapons.
hey filthy frank what if i have a waifu avatar and watch little amounts of anime but im not obsessed with the culture and just do it for the lolz am i a weeaboo?
This shit is the reason why I want to change my last name.
fuck anime
so i watch anime,have an anime profile pic and also buy anime merch. does that mean i am a weeaboo or just an anime fan. btw i am in touch with my own culture i guess
Anime is gay.
I am sitting in the bathroom and trying not to laugh my ass off while watching this
no joke my ear was actually bleeding after this video...
this video literally exploded all over the Internet
lmao i could not stop laughing omg you funny XD are all your vids like this, why is this my first time seeing this
This was the first Filthy Frank video I ever watched, and my first impression was "oh, so this middle aged Japanese man is here to educate me"





I couldn't be more wrong/right.
This is pure art
6:05.....
I wonder if any Japanese people have reached this realm of youtube.
What's worse: A brony or a weaboo? I need help to figure this out.
Don't scroll









Now you have to like this comment or 7 years of bad luck. Also Leave me a Cheeky Sub.
I'm probably going to get attacked Because of this but yeah I think I'm a weeaboo. I watch anime and I try to learn Japanese. I just really enjoy the culture but I don't learn it from Anime however. I make sure I don't say anything I don't know is completely correct and I'm just learning how to speak it on the down low. I don't do all the creepy shit just watch anime and know a little bit of Japanese.
I think I'm in love.
Frank. I want your children. MAKE IT HAPPEN... :D
I like watching those Chinese cartoons. You know, Japanimation?
XD is this meant as a joke?! im new so i really don't know
Wait, I own a katana, but the katana is Vergil's katana, from a videogame. Does that make me a weeaboo fag or a devil may cry fag?
My namu is cowboy Tanaka.
my favourite animes are sponge bob and glee
Guys basicaly, being a pedo rapist is better than being a weeaboo, like
srsly
MY CAPS LOCK IS ON AND IM READY TO RAGE!!!!!! >:3 Breaths really heavy and screams IM NOT A WEEABOO!!!!! XD jk
he live with is mom
if u hear closly he sez mom then he sez nabor
I like you're videos but,stop saying gay shit,OK?
We shouldn't have stopped at Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Ironyyyyyyy!
Oh lord I shoot myself in the asshole thinking about how this video was recommended for me. But I checked out the channel and it's the worst piece of shit in the world. Which is why I continue to watch it. Probably because I'm atheist and I don't go to school. But u know. So I just wanted to say I love your rants about stereotypes and nothing against anyone but I'd love to see what kind of video u can make out of goths üòÇ please take this trash idea into consideration.  Peace out papafranku.
Pffft speechless
l0l
1:03 i fucking vomitted at that fat prick
I have knives.... A lock back knife and a knife that hides in a bullet...and a rifle..
how r u this funny(:
Animes are overrated pretty¬†sure you could go fine any other cartoon and get the same feel from it.
Hhahahahahaha dude you're a fucking hero amazing. you made me laugh and pee at the same time X'D
Hilarious!
Props to you!
Fuck the babies & haters HAHAHAHA.
I used to wanna be Shrek.. so I could get a piece of that ass :(
6:57
I CAN'T BREATHE XD
Well... suppose it's mostly true that Japanese people produce a lot of weird shit.
Thy jimmes hath been rustled.
I thank ye for thy rustling.¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ° ¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ° ¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ° ¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ° ¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ° ¬∞)( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ° ¬∞)

Family Guy is better than all anime ever made.
3:59 i watched 2 ....check your privilege
Do another v
id plz
I'm just looking for Luffy... zZzZzZZZZZ
You cant lie evrry thing he say is true and he should get paid for being this funny
I love how his voice gets deeper when he speaks japanese.
Clearly if someone has these views about Japan,  then they don't really know anything much about the culture.  That could mean one of two things,  there either older and somethings wrong,  or they're younger and just don't know any better.  What you had was an opportunity to show this particular group of people the truth about what they assume to be such a great place.  But no,  instead you decided to sound like the rest of the stupid Internet and insults and criticize.  There's a few YouTubere out there who really use their power to hurt other people and perpetuate problems,  and it seems to me like you're definitely one of those. X(
I keep hearing pink eye..

I HATE PINK EYE ):O
I fucking love you so much. Laughed my ass off. You sound awesome speaking Japanese btw.
Look at all these weeaboos, did you know anime and the mangas or mangos, whatever it was called, promotes child pornography? Anime and manga is disgusting.
Now gaze upon all my videos which have been edged with the edgiest of anime.
As soon as i heard "Cory in the house" i just....i stopped breathing
Let's be honest, cory in the house is the best anime.
The internet has ruined Japan for me, I hate everything Japanese now. I remember when I thought Pokemon was cool.¬†.¬∑¬¥¬Ø`(>‚ñÇ<)¬¥¬Ø`¬∑.
Papa Franku c:
I miss Weeaboo Jones ... Can you back Him ? Her ? LoL WTF?!
i love when weaboos think they can speak japanese because they watch anime.
My waifu could beat your waifu.
Dat male anime MC impression doh.
Prince of Bel Air is the best anime!
My favorite animes are High School Musical,¬†Wizards of Waverly Place and iCarly.
Stop making fun of weeaboos. Ur making my waifu sad!
I'm fucking crying from watching all your videos. I don't know if it's a cry for help or from humor...
this guys voice¬†
i love how raspy and choppy it is
if my car sounded like that, I'd prolly bring it in for repairs
dude sounds like he's got a bad connection... with his own vocal cords!
cant tell if 90 year old man...
or a voice recording from 1950
love and subscribed!
I'm a weeaboo! Come at me Bitches!!

P.S Haters, be creative with the insults!

9:46 beccabae
fuck weeaboos
they suck ass and are overcoming the community
plus they are usless to the countrie
People think that Otakus or " Weeabos " as some idiots would say .... are stupid
But in fact, the more you create new words and definitions for people
the more stupid you become
the one who created the word " Weeabos " is stupider and idiotic more than the " Weeabos " themselves
My favorite  anime ..... Corey in the house
Lol mane
conniver's kunai?
Imagine somebody just walks by while he's doing the Weeaboo Jones thing...
Your neighbors must love you
People who need to stop living

1:bronys
2:weeaboos

                        Thank you for your time
This guy should play batman
Tbh Attack on Titan was actually pretty good.
Why aren't u posting
This is why I'm a shut in closet anime fan LOOOL

I don't want people to think of me like what Frank portrayed when I say "I like anime" hahaa
Weaboos are fucked in their autistic heads. They need to be beaten until they are cured.
Drink some water.. Goddayum...
At 6:20 the guy playing the recorder with his nose has my dying on the floor
WEEABOO JONES OH MY GOD I CAN'T BREATH I AM IN TEARS
Cory in the house hentai is pretty good thou...
LOL I had a classmate who practiced jutsus in the corner. He also ran with his arms trailing behind him as if he actually thought he was a ninja lmao
What drugs did you take making this?
Everyone is calling each other weeaboos and normies and I'm sitting here wondering why this of all videos is Frank's most viewed.
1:50 omg this is freaking legendary!!!!!
fuck weeaboos , they are a fking shame to the planet
Frank is my goddamn spirit animal
How come a man can feel like a women and then be accepted as a woman, same thing
fuck weeaboos in the ass Frank!!!!‚Ä¶jk‚Ä¶lol
funniest video na
. being collective about anime and manga is not a bad thing. im sorry but i watch anime a lot i am a total fan i learn japanese educational im not a weaboo and i find this video a lil offensive
...whats wrong with liking AoT? xD
....
The laughing fat girl with the pageboy haircut looks like my 5th grade teacher.

Checks comments for ranting weeaboos trying to start flame wars for some evening comedy
There's two dead jewish people in your closet??? XD
dis sum DANK SHIT M9
Does he know he's screaming?
lmao idk y ppl are getting im a fucking weeb:P this otaku is not offended one bit but i accept my weebness this shit is fucking hilarious i listien to the weeaboo song all the time cause its funnyXD
Well Frank, I do agree weeaboos are disgusting, but really, I don't think everyone with an anime avatar is one...
2k people are weeaboos
Omg I think i laughed way too hard at this!! Lol this makes me confused if I am a weeaboo now. I enjoy anime, but I don't think I go that far with anime...And I don't say I am Japanese. Maybe I do need a reality check !! Lmfao. This is true though. Especially the buying Japanese Swords without knowing how to use it. For an anime fan I believe some people NEED to see this video. Time to say some Japanese shit to piss people who repeatedly say "Your profile picture is anime so you should be quiet."  off in the comment section. Sugoiii! ~
Watching anime makes you a weaboo. I was unaware that the meaning of weaboo had changed to encompass all who enjoy anime, or admire Japanese culture. Thanks for enlightening me. Excuse me while I go watch anime. Cuz Im a fucking Weeb, who deserves to die. :)
Anime is gay
hes actually really attractive outside of youtube. and hes not 52, hes 21. the real guy. his name is Juji and hes HOT look up filfyfrank revealed
I understand what he said whoop
What about bronies?
4:09 that's how Marth sounds like. (Marth from Fire emblem/smash bros.)
angry typing intensifies*

I watch naruto and i dont use anime characters as my profile picture

I play soccer and listen to non-lyric musics only and do my work or study
and i dont fucking fap and if you see this discussion is total crap dont mind it im just pretending that I'm fucked up with english
This man needs therapy ASAP.
Could I be privately invited to your show? I have Weaboo songs on my playlist and I like Anime. Please cure me Frank, we would all love your great help.
NO!
Heil Hito
Why do I get a feeling that FilthyFrank watches child pornography on the deep web...
Lol he should be a rapper and a voice actor....and I aint a weaboo I just like the show XD
dontt know wtf i just watched but ¬†i liked it
I so agree, I mean, gimme da poosy.. Boss!
I saw Filthy Frank today at a Japanese Convention.
I was having some fun with my grandmother while she endured through her last days on earth.
She dressed up in a cheap Sonic costume I made from her bedsheets.
I dressed up as my grandmother, holding a "CURE AIDS" sign to raise awareness of her disease.
Then, I saw him.
He was talking to a Japanese girl with no neck.
I admired him, he was so sweet.
Who else but Filthy Frank would willingly talk to a handicapped weeaboo so generously?
I told my grandmother, "don't move or I'll get dad to whip you tonight."
I skipped away as a single tear dropped down her cheek.
"Frank! I'm a huge fan. Could you donate to my 'CURE AIDS' foundation?" I asked.
"Sure, whenever I'm finished collecting the blood of your siblings," he smiled.
I breathed on his neck, and whispered, "Please donate."
He dropped a coin in my bucket and slapped me across the knee, and told me to go have fun.

I'll never have fun...never...
Filthy Frank is my spirit animal
52 year old? You have aged extremely well...Tell me your secrets!
R.I.P

Im learning japanese, but not because anime. geniuenly because im a game fan and i want to be able to experience some games before they come out in america.
"Hey, don't talk shit on Attack on Titan. It's a really good show." that's actually me oh no abort mission abort ABORT I DON'T WANT TO BE A WEEABOO I AM A GOOD PERSON FRANK PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR MY SINS
I will try to play melodica with my nose.(and fail at it.)
i have that drawing tablet
XDDD Oh God, this was great.
Great. I have an anime picture.

I swear I'm not a weeabo.

I swear to Lord Chin Chin.
The best anime is Robot Chicken
Hi
Wafflepwn is the best anime ever
Hana Montana Was the best Anime
It's like if a Japanese person watches Looney Tunes and think they're American.
9:57 Is PBG!
Weeaboos are the biggest cringe
1:42
Do you have >50 years !!!? wtf ...
Filthy Frank shall lead the attack against all Weeaboos
Anime sucks
i wunt that smexy highschool uniform
Cmon frank... You shouldn't make fun of mentally handicapped ppl... :3
Hey Franku we're did you get your degree in Internet retardation devry naw man just kidding I love you man your awesome
Basically Hyperdimention Neptunia's Fanbase.
Lol I just watch it from time to time I don't have books and swords and shit lol
Dude you're funny
We need people like you on the Internet
okay, let me get this straight:

people who have anime pics say that 'death to all weaboos'. 
I'm not a weaboo 
I do not fuck a body pillow
i hate chopsticks

i only watch anime for the fun of it

and i'm Latvian, I don't really care about anything...
I don't go "OMG I MASTERBATE TO LIGHT" or "SHEREK IS FUCKING HOT"

I'm normal guys, so are people who are not weaboos and just like anime.
This is surreal.
8:51 Womens? WTF is that?
My ..........¬†lord this guy can not be real....
He's trying so hard and being so¬†ironically bad¬†it's actually¬†displeasing and charmless.¬†

But I¬†got to admit,¬†I couldn't breath when shit got so real with¬†that pigeon, that he had to completely¬†stop the whole bit to deal with it.¬†That shit was too funny.
Avatar is the best anime¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Why are weeaboos commenting on this video like frank hasn't ripped them to shreds for 10 mins. They should just kill them selfs
You wanna know what I find fucking hilarious and equally ironic about Japan.
Otakus and Weeaboos will praise Japanese culture but if they actually lived there like they say they want to, they would be made fun of on the streets, frequently harassed, and possibly even beat up due to them disgracing Japanese culture by falsely imitating it in their eyes.
Papa franku should do an episode like on this on furries, they're even worse.
Pingu is the best anime ever fap everitiem
3:28
I always show every weeaboo this and they get super pissed. It's literally how they all act.
Frank, tell me you were wearing underwear when you put salamander mans costume on cuz i think i just saw some hairy pink guy.
W-Where are the subtitles?¬†‚óâ_‚óâ
Lol lost it at ''where are the subtitles''
People actually like this guy? His voice sounds so raspy and annoying.
rapid typing and and heavy breathing intensifies
you speak the fuvking truth about weaboos üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
i hate weeaboos
But Chris Chan isnt a weeaboo
Law and order best anime ever
I'd rather cure my brain tumor with a bullet than be a fuckin weeaboo.
I graduated from my weaboo phase like a year ago. Now, I cringe at my past self
Where is he from
Who want to start a holocaust with me
I was born in anjo Japan and moved to united kingdom at the age of 3 I am not Japanese my parents were on vacation then I was born and my mom lived in Japan for a while but I thought it was really nice intil I went back for a couple of months to Tokyo and I discovered I didn't fucking like it in tokyo anjo is ok dough my dad is from guyana and my mom is American
i just can't stop laughing im glad my friend showed this to me
I fucking hate anime

Grabs Pringles
I like anime a lot but I never want to go to Japan I fucking love America
im kinda new to this weeaboo bullshit lol and they already sound pathetic as fuck. but what do neckbeards have to do with weeaboos or is it something that papa franku just thought of lol
Scooby Doo is waifu.
Man, fuck people with anime icons, they're fucking assh- oh wait im one of those assholes.... fuck.
I live next to a weaboo and when he opens his apartment door it smells like Dorritos, Mountain Dew, crusty semen and discontent.
Remember that time in Cory in the house when Cory when super black to find his dad who left him years ago but instead he raped his dad for drug money. Ah good times also spoilers by the way.
Fuck weeaboos.
Alright (Serious question for everyone) Q:Would i be considered a "WEEABOO?" Only reason why i started to learn and do know how to read/write/talk a good amount of japanese is because i wanted to play my ps2 game Berserk Milenium Falcon...
I don't have to worry about being a Weeaboo I'm Filipino, and  I freaking hate them for what they did to my grandparents
But oppai....
Did they break into a school for this?...
Fucking Weaboos !!!
* * * ¬†* waits for them shitheads and numb nuts * * * ¬†*
all i know about japan is that apparently the tokyo rush hour is the embodiment of aids. and there are apparently school girl prostitutes according to vice.
Shrek is best anime
i have a cory body pillow

Cory In The House is the best anime, wake up weeaboos
GASP! CHRIS-CHAN!!!

Thanks douchebag for insulting every person out their who use anime; among other things to escape from a life that is depressing. Let people do what they want without being judged for it. Who cares if they like things that aren't serious enough for you.
+TVFilthyFrank thank you for saving me from weeaboioism I greatly appreciate it.
FF: you see these people with anime profile pictures in the YouTube comments.

Me: oh ._.
Someone needs to photoshop frank's face on Tomas the tank engine l
Weaboos are like wiggers
i am really fucking racist but if i could only send one kind of persons to the gas chamber it would be weeaboos
I think it's cute that the population of weeaboos are thought to be over weight 35+ yr old men living in their mothers basement who don't shower and spend their time trying to fuck a pillow.
QwQ I'm none of those things, But I am a weeaboo :')
that video I was talking about is by some youtuber phoenix shadow the video is called re weeaboos
How to be a weaboo on the internet: Type an user name you want in japanese,Let the ignorance come rolling in.Funny thing is i'm 87% Japanese and asian nomad but hey according to them we have to be in japan :/ but people like Venus Angelic hit the scene "Oh shes sooo cute" lols and nope i'm not hating on her i actually think shes adorable but she kinda defines a weaboo to a tee...
I like hentai
Someone took this seriously and made a video about it -_-
Honestly, this is my favorite video on the internet.
Lol this is the funniest shit ever.
10:08 a wild Chris Chan appeared
Lmao half the people in the comments profile pictures are Anime characters and they are saying how weeaboos are retarded weeaboos should be mass genocided
XD someone called me a weeaboo because i wore a dbz t shirt with japanese on it from hot topic
ok yea im such a weeaboo, totally yep i hate those americans good, and im offened by this video, whole nine yards,
lol such sarcasim
Whenever someone says "don't talk shit about Attack on Titan" I just use my backup jetpack and fly the fuck out of there
Does it make me a weeaboo that i started learning japanese because of anime but not through anime?
suck a D
I hope you die
Whelp...
i think this is what you call an overreaction...
papa frank I have a question, don't get me wrong I hate those weeaboo bitches to, but is it ok to have a katana because I like the movie kill bill?
Cory in the house is definitely my favorite anime, Spongebob is a close second.
Wow his anime voice is fucking perfect.
I will admit I am weeaboo trash but please tell me i'm not the only one who cringed at some of the pictures during the weeaboo song
The reason I don't watch anime is because of weeaboos and otakus. I really don't want to get pulled into that autistic fanbase. I feel like fanbases are the worst. That's why I also hate on bronies.
The only thing I like watching in subbed is Hentai.
I laughed so hard at Seinfeld
Sounds like Batman.
Ik wat message ur tryin to put across, Filthy Frank but i just cant ignore those pics from the weeaboo song. Im just saying that just because your fat and try to do cosplay does not make you a weeaboo. Also just because you like to collect anime merchandise doesn't make you a weeaboo either. Idk if that slideshow was just part of the weeaboo song but the slideshow did not really add up with the definition of a 'weeaboo'.

Im an Anime Fan but i dont abused my self as an Otaku or weeaboo its just some sort of childish atitude thing and that is the worst part in your life im 17 and im too matured for those things... I love Japan not because of Anime but because of their Culture , beautiful place nice people good foods :3 and some wierd stuff that i can buy only in Japan and thats it :) 


SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH 
(I DONT HAVE POTATO)
this vid is chill
Hey kids in the 12-14 reigion! Want to flash your privates on social media and not be punished!? GO TO JAPAN~!!!! Flies off on a manly rainbow while the weaboos chase me
I¬¥will summon the plague: ...Anime?
MAKE VLOGS!
what is the anime title 1:18 ?
Holy crap someone on the Internet that actually knows what weeaboo means instead of using it randomly at everyone.
Weebs are like Nazi, there are planning on taking over, or is that Japanese culture? Or hatsune miku? I dont know honestly...
CORY IN THE HOUSE IS MY FAVORITE ANIME IM NOT A WEEABOO GUYS PLS NOTICE ME BECAUSE I AM KAWAII DESU NE NYA
Boku No Pico
Weeaboo Jones is an alt of Brad Jones, the Weeaboo Snob.
Do actually people think women in Japan have those huge eyes?
"Anime was an error and all my fans are fucking faggots" ¬† -Akira Toriyama
Serious truth bomb, don't change your avatar to Hentai, shit's gross.

Fuck's wrong with you.
I like you...
Look at dat bussy show me da bussy give me da bussy I want da bussy back up da bussy oh what a bussy
Do you like jimmy neutron? It's my favorite anime.
He has a Kagawa shirt lol
My first anime was Sailor Moon ^-^
That glorious intro!
The Texas ranger is a good ass anime
What does he actually say in Japanese at the beginning?
Ok let's be serious 
Seinfeld is the best anime out there
fuck you Japanese dog , I rather be a chineseboo
im a big scary russian who wears a bulls snapback and baggy dickies but on the downlow i love cute adorable chibi moe characters and truthfully i dont give a fuck what anyone thinks about it, im not a faggot or a disgusting weeb, im secure enough in my own masculinity that i can watch kiniro mosaic and haruhi and i dont give a fuck if people think that dosent really fit in with the fact that i watch sports and listen to death metal and gangsta rap.
Weeaboo Jones is bae‚ù§
I fucking love this video
lmao sorry for being an asshole xDDD but holy fucking shit are the people in some of those photos sad fuckers
Does anyone knows what's the music playing at 6:43 ??
Anime is for fags ¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
hes 52 wtf
Watch my last video Frank, "If i had CSGO on a disc" Im almost as fcked as you !
Was he really speaking japanese at the start if the video ?
Weaboos are fuggin' nerds B)
A social reject, is a social reject. It doesn't matter what title you give them.
rossseta stoooooone
Hey, filthy frank, you NEED to make a video about those damn disgusting "bronies" just as bad as weeaboos if not worse becuase instead of jacking off to 13 year old girls, they jack off to horses.
What would the Japanese term for weeaboo be?
I feel like if Frank did a video on feminism, society may implode.
Apparently 1,976 weeaboos have watched your video to date! Lol :-) (amount of dislikes when I watched the video lol)
I laughed so hard, I'm crying XD
It's sooooo tru even fucking kik
What's worse? A weaboo or a westaboo.
Gomenasai, my name is Ken-Sama
I'm a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)

I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.

I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%

When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!

I own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.

Is he sick or something ? Why does he talk like that its annoying
(Pigeon lands on window) Archimedes?!
Well if i do say myself...
Anime is trash
The only anime worth watching is shrek. Loved the opening.
I love this
Song at the end goes out to all the WEEABOOS that cried the day Superman brought Goku back from the dead JUST to kick his ass a 2nd time!
Weeaboos are gross tho
lol
such a weird name weeaboo
I almost cried of laughter, this was hilarious
Im on the right side of youtube again.
Why the fuck was this recommended to me by  #Music ¬†on Youtube?
Dude, where have you been all my life? I thought I was alone.
Don't you just feel like slapping a child across the fucking mouth after hearing them talk about fucking Naruto.
AHAHAHAHA LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I hate weebs @_@ +Baka Chan
Fucking loved this guy, definitely subscribing, goddamn.
The Accuracy is Astounding
You know shit is fucked up on this world when you watch Filthy Frank to make yourself feel better about shit.
My favorite anime is Cory in the house
HAHHHAA the part where he goes like " nobody really speaks like this in japan" reminds me of every anime I've ever watched, that's exactly how they sound.
What if I just like Katanas?
I am not a weeaboo but fuck. Does defending AOT make me a weeaboo? Well shit. I guess I am not the scrub lord
i love how all people with anime avatars are like; " yeah he's right LOL fuck weeaboos "

bunch of hypocrites
3:43

¬†"there is a pigeon outside my window.. ".. Frank.. these interactions happen to every living human who has a window.. something out there called the world.. i wonder who is the weeaboo now lol..
Hentai is da best anime.
I love how every weeaboo is trying to excuse themselves and trying too hard to not being called weeaboo saying: "Oh i like insert a list of anime series and these mangas and i like japan but i'm not a weeaboo" or "i'm an otaku not a weeaboo learn the difference" ffs this makes you more weeaboo that you already are... like frank's says: " if you like anime i don't give a shit, just don't bring that shit near me"
I love how he said races and black people separately...... l0l
Prepare for all the butthurt weeaboo comments! <3 :D :D

THIS IS THE FILTHY FRANK SHOW! PREDJUDICE EQUALITY!

EVERYONE GETS SHIT!
i like how most of these comments saying this is funny have fucking anime characters for their profile pics and are using emojis in their comments.
I love him
This guy just earned himself a + 1 subscriber
You are far more disgusting than weeaboos bro ...
Weebs are a cancer, nothing left to say.
This is the perfect thing to watch after jacking off because it is the easiest way to kill a boner
I dare you not to reply my comment
But franku... You also have a drawing as a profile picture...
Me: I'm gonna go to Japan soon
Friend: OH WAT YOURE JUST A WEEABOO NOW HUH
ME: No I got a scholarship to study abroad...
Fuck all of yall i like Seinfeld!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Frank, how did you forget about weeaboos proclaiming the Japanese dub always being "better" than the English dub?
So basically all fat virgins right?
I can fap to your voice.
Yeah but the guy at 9:22 gets da b*tches so being Sasuke works for him
Papa Franku? I know Toy Story and Cory in the House is great but what about The Suite life of Zack and Cody or even Phil of the future? I thought those Animes were at LEAST decent...
just weird
Peppa Pig was a good anime until the 8th season and 5th episode when they made a crossover with Cory in the House, and that awful cameo with Shrek was just painful to look at
Lets play spot the angry weeaboo in the comments
You have seen them in your mom's attic, they smell bad lmao
Does anyone know what's the name of the track that starts playing at around 6:44 (b0ss uses it whenever he introduces a new realm).. Or at least what genre of music it belongs to?
Corey in the House though¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Frank is one of the most intelligent beings in the universe.
Hello my name is Cowboy Taraka
lmfao
I love how half of this comment section is people with anime pics talking about how they aren't mad when they clearly are.
pshh, weeaboo's these days¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
THAT COWBOY PART GETS ME EVERY FUCKING TIME
I like anime but I don't consider myself an otaku(I think that's fucking annoying as shit) or any but american. The only thing anime related I'd want would be graphic tees and posters. Body pillows are gross af.
Piece of Percy's ass. Lmao
UGHHHh..don't even get me started on this..
first of all who cares if we not Japanese? I was not born Japanese but ever since that first episode of clanad I've been learning Japanese and now I'm a official Japanese desu~ 

Why I'm Japanese (and neko chan who commented also who is kawaiiii~)

*I EAT POCKY
*I WATCH JAPANESE SUB NOT ENGLISH DUB
*I HAVE OVER 200 FIGURINES OF ANIME CHARACTETS
*I OWN CHIBI DOLLS
*I KNOW JAPANESE!!!
*I CAN MAKE MY EYES LOOK SMALLER
*WATCHED OVER 300 ANIMES
*TOOK ME A WEEK TO FINISH 500+ EPISODE ANIMES

SEE!!! So stop judging <3

Kawaii measure: 0/10 cuz u call pplz weeabos just cuz their jalapenese and u aren't ~
THIS SOCIETY IS FUCKED
Don't get why everyone hates on the mLp fanbase I'm not a part of it, but we have way worse fandoms than that cough weeabos cough
Don't let your memes become dreams or was it don't let your dreams become memes
i haven't laughed so hard for so long. you are beautiful +TVFilthyFrank¬† :')
Haha funniest thing I've seen in a while couldn't stop laughing!
The 1k dislikes r from the weaboos :O
Always take cold showers or else you'll end up like Frank
Weeaboos disgust me with their Jap cartoons (or anime as they call it) of sexualised little girls showing their panties.
It's child abuse.
Drake and josh is the greatest anime series hands down!
How come I haven't found before XD
Brony > Weeabo they're both fuckin' annoying tho.
Translation of the first part: "I jokes Amanda your side DC factually. Sure soils reported area order to close at the Rock and heating up that he did that. Do you hold a machine that." xD
rofl i think i died laughing :v
10:19 i know this fucking guy HAHAHAHAHAH
Attack on tight men is my favorite animoo
This was a really funny and intresting video!
Weeaboos r ghey fagets
Guys ot appears Weeaboos are the 201x's and further version of the nerds. Wait a couple of years and it'll be cool to be one, as well as everyone being one
I'm an otaku but no weeaboo I know im not japanese and when i say japanese words its ironic but this video was funny af you guys r just butthurt not a serious video its called a joke loosen up
Ey b0ss if ur ofended bi dis video ¬† ---> ¬† 5:38¬†

Note: ur a faget¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Honestly this is fucking true even if it's satire. I've known many in all my years and despise them.
Wouldn't the weeaboo protection chamber be the outdoors?
Frank in this vid you sound like Jerma
BUBBLETEA!!!
Weeaboos be getting so offended
this song speaks to the heart :'(






XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
I don't see a problem in collecting weapons. A lot of people collect swords simply because they are quite cool
Weeaboos are the reason I stay away from the anime fandom. I like to watch anime occasionally (as an aspiring animator, I can admire it and other Asian-animated/influenced shows from a technical standpoint. Of course, there are shows/movies from the west that I like for the same reason.), but those who take their interests too far are just embarrassing themselves, especially since weebs are looked at just as badly in Japan as they are America/online.

I don't care if someone likes anime or not. Doesn't affect my interests in any way, and if they don't like anime, fine. Everyone's got their own interests and are entitled to them. Just as long as they don't take things to cringe-inducing levels. (Especially if they post shit to the internet. What's on here stays on here.)
You fucks, Rocky balboa¬†is the best anime, can you not see the superb writing?
I JUSTE WANTED A PIECE OF PERCY ASS YOU FEEL ME Crys¬†
I JUSTE WANTED A PIECE OF THAT HELICOPTERS ASS Crys
BUT THAT SHIT NEVER HAPPEND
I have never seen a video with so many likes and so few dislikes have such a massive flame war. Its like everyone agrees with the video (I mean why wouldn't you its awesome) yet disagrees with eachother. Intriguing to say the least.
I lost it at "virgin realm" xD
Shadow clone jutsu apparently requires Mangekyou Sharingan... Man xD
How can you not shower in 16 weeks?
papa franku should continue doing vlogs
I don't think collecting swords makes you a weaboo .-. I mean I really enjoy rapiers......  I also enjoy throwing knives. It's fun to throw... Especially during camping.
100k likes
we made it internet


we made it
Main reason before I get a sword I learn how to sword fight so I can use the sword I want to get
I also wanted Percy's nice ass
Everyday we stray from god's light
I typed this really fucking fast
he is seriously funny but his energy is overpowering his voice is raping my head phones. and then he gets to close to the camera but apparently that is his apeal. Like this video put it on favorites
The one percent of the people who dislike this video are the weeaboos
Wow, I can't believe how many people (normal anime fans):

1) Took this seriously
and
2) Are actually offended

Y'all ever heard of "satire"?
It's not necessarily weeaboos that piss me of. It's people who complain about receiving shit on THE INTERNET... Think about where u r. Everyone gets shit here even if they are innocent and its fucking awesome! So if you are going to complain about being offended or something, please cut or hang yourself because u are a worthless sack of shit that deserves to live their life as a paraplegic and watch their parents die of cancer and then get sent into foster care of an abusive family and take the role of Mayu from Elfen Lied. The only difference is that you can't escape due to your condition so you end up getting raped by your stepdad every day.
"Anime"
Subscribe to my channel it's pretty meh
anyone want to hear him speak normally?
breathing heavily and typing on the keyboard fast XDD
ey b0ss
FilthyFrank is my spirit animal
1) by the way, cosplaying doesnt maje you a weaabo
2) instead of fighting in the comment section, lets appreciate his screams at 7:57 XD
Everybody who doesn't like anime in this comment section is calling everybody who likes anime a weeaboo...
his voice made this all the more funny
I loooove anime, but i will never become a weeaboo, i have too much selfrespect. This vid described everything i hate about weebs, they should kill themselves with there weapon collection.
I have never seen any of his videos before but this is amazing and he's amazing.
I AM LITERALL y cRYIN G TEARS
This video scared me into working out

I just realized I'm a Weeabo. No wonder nobody likes me in real life and in Maplestory.
I'm in tears, FF is pure gold.
Lmfao my ex was a fucking weeaboo, how I survived I have no idea. It was annoying....and yes he did not take showers or brush his teeth AND he still lives with his mom almost 22 by now. I was with him because at first he wasn't a weeaboo but he transformed into one , the relationship ended badly and he got fat. Everything you said in this video is true about my ex EVERYTHING
Ive felt this way about weeaboos my whole life. I thought I was alone in my hate for the weeaboo cancer scum that infects societies across the world. I love you Frank, you're my soulmate.
Where are the SUBTITLES!!!
Fuck all your boku no pico shit you gotta get Cory in the house, Thomas the dank train engine, all that shit
lol its so true i just watch anime but im not weeaboo trash
yeah i hate those dudes with anime profile pics they are so weird
i is hATRE mooharha
I'd love to go to a convention, walk up to a weeaboo, and talk to him in Japanese, and watch the look on their faces. The only problem is, I don't know Japanese, and weeaboos never leave their houses.
one guy had a longsword, it's different
hahaha
You should do voice acting. ^_^
i can see theres around 2000 WEEABOOS (2000 dislikes).
I really want to hear this guys real voice, in both languages
Help i'm slowly turning in a f** weeaboo what should i do?
Weeaboos are like autism. They're both taking the world by storm, and there's not a damn thing we can do about it. Sucks, I know.
Where are the subtitlesüòÇ
Cory in the house is best house!
I LOVE HENTAIS xd
what in the everloving fuck
Stupid weeaboos XD I think I laughed so hard I woke my parents!
wow my annoying classmate needs to see this he is telling us a tall story that he has a girlfriend from japan and with violet hair lol what a weeaboo
U WANNA CUM INSIDE MY ASSCHEECKS BOSS????
I only watched dbz
No offense, but in the comments section here, it sometimes pisses me off when people are like: OH YOU LIKE ANIME, SO YOU'RE A WEEABOO! Like wtf dude? I mean like- Okay sure, you have your own opinions but for example, you like American cartoons, can I be like: OH YOU LIKE CARTOONS, SO YOU'RE A SHUT IN! That kind of thing? OF COURSE NOT! I mean like- the difference between an ANIME FAN and WEEABOO is different. I mean like Weeaboos CAN like anime but then like, their behaviour towards the Japanese culture is just different. Weeaboos can get like REALLY offensive to the Japanese culture and a little sentence like: oh you're so KAWAII DESU~ can just literally blow up our minds. Anime fans are just like fans from different fandoms, it DOESN'T make us Weeaboos if we LIKE anime. It makes us WEEABOOS when we're like literally OBSESSED with the Japanese culture. Weeaboos are LITERALLY people that are like "OH HOW AM I NOT JAPANESE? I'M SPIRITUALLY JAPANESE!" and ANIME fans are like: OH WE LOVE ANIME! CAN YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE NOW? It annoys me so much when people are so blind and don't see the difference. I mean like, who wants their fandom to be misunderstood. == and no, I'm not a weeaboo, or else I would have been like: OH KONNICHIWA MINNA-SAN~. "" IF YOU HAVE AN ANIME AVATAR, YOU'RE OFFICIALLY A WEEABOO"" GOOD JOB WITH YOUR SENSE OF LOGIC. SO IF YOU LIKE HAVE A VIDEO GAME AVATAR, YOU'RE A SHUT IN WHO ONLY PLAYS VIDEO GAMES? WELL APPARENTLY NO. (End of rant AND PLEASE NO, ANIME FANS, YOU KNOW THAT THE WORD 'OTAKU' IS ACTUALLY AN INSULT TO PEOPLE WHO LOVE ANIME, NOW STOP INSULTING YOURSELF..?) oh and if you notice, no, if my username thingy (IDK WUT IT'S CALLED OKAY?) is in Japanese, no that doesn't make me a weeaboo. .. I'M NOT LIKE OH SENPAI (WHEEZES) NOTICE ME, YOU MAKE MY HEART GO DOKI DOKI.
Some people do talk like that though XD
my profile picture is a pretty good anime
Weeaboos are still better than Otakus and Bronies.
I HAV ANIME PICTURE
how the fuck did weeaboo jones infiltrate the WEEABOO PROTECTION CHAMBER
+TVFilthyFrank¬†I'VE BEEN LEARNING JAPANESE THROUGH THE ANIME I WATCH. YOU DONT KNOW ANY JAPANESE. AND IM GOING TO VISIT JAPAN ALL I WANT SINCE IM CONSIDERED JAPANESE NOW THAT I USE ROSETTA STONE. FUCK YOU AND YOUR CHANNEL. IM A 100% WEABOO AND IM NOT GOING TO LET A FUCKING UGLY ASS CHINESE LITTLE 19 YEAR OLD TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE YOU FUCKING BITCH

If you don't like this video, you don't know how to have fun.
+Legendary Wizard7¬†Just a hilarious treat when you come back from your trip :P
Its just an obsession i'm not sure if im a weaboo and i really dont care.
Lets be serious here Dragonball z and Walker Texas Ranger are the only cool man-imes.
I collect pre-cold war bayonets.
LOL That Chris Chan image though
Hey !Anonymous! I started watching anime when I was a todler, my first ever anime was Zatch Bell I think.
Good thing we are ridding of the weeaboos now get the rat poison the rodents must go away lol.
"My favourite animes include Toy Story, Cory in the House, and airplane instruction videos from the 80s." XD
3:27 subs sure shot me xD
Thats one sexy voice. Reminds me of the screaming goat. c:
WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY
Why do weaboos have to be so serious about anime?!Once somebody says something about Naruto,weaboos run into the comments and blazingly start typing  that this person should go kill themselves.All weaboos out there,that is not funny.what if I said that all weaboos should jump off a window because you waste at your lives all day,watching hentai or any anime!?We all have lives,and lives are not to be thrown away.anybody who says im wrong and explains why,I'll be sure to tell them thank you
Ha jokes on you frank i waste my money on video game weapons
WEEABOOS
Disgusting people with anime avatar and fake names. Disgusting.
Papa Franku needs to do an episode where he reads the fanfic Persuing Percy
My favorite anime is the super mario brothers super show
5:11
Ok I went to an anime convention here in America, and one of the days was the 4th of July. I didn't go that day bc why the heck you celebrate Japanese culture on Independence Day
WOW YOU INSTULT ANIME I GUESS I HAVE TO USE TYPO NO FASTU JUTSU ALSO ATTACK ON TITAN IS A GOOD SHOW AND TOY STORY, CORY IN THE HOUSE, TRAIN VIDEOS FROM THE 80S, AND SEINFELD ARE ONLY GOOD FOR THE FAN ART FUCKING PLEB NORMIE SUCK MY BODY PILLOW
Bronies are the same way Frank.
(Ps: I respect Bronies, despite not watching the show.)
Dude just said he has two dead jews in his closet
MY NIGGA
Family Guy sucks,FUCK FAMILY GUY!~
Same thing applies to koreaboos
I have an anime profile picture and I love to watch anime, but I fucking hate weeaboos.
OH noooooooo!!!!! AM I A ONE... HELP MEEEEEE!!!!!
This is why anime is shit :)
üòÇ
What the fuck did I just watch?
Which is worser? Bronies or weeaboos?
gotta say bronies are better then weeaboos,you can atleast understand most of the shit bronies say XD
So true cuz I had a good amount of these kind of kids when I was in high school and most of them were special ed kids üòÇ
Wait do you normally sound like that if you speak english, if so i thought you just make up that sound.
Cory in the house üòÇüòÇüòÇ
this is painfully accurate
Ho Ho Ho!! That's actually funny. I never knew a japanese male can sound so feminine. Ho ho ho. And nice joke btw... "where are the subtitles" lol. By the way, I have a question. Does preferring subs over dubs count as a weeaboo? Also, does saying ¬†"Oi!!!!" in Hajimi Ichinose's voice count as being a weeaboo?
that weeaboo jones is actually pretty creepy with his walking style and the music.
Weeaboo Jones had me in fucking tears LOL
Scrumpdidlyumches
When the weeaboo song came on I broke my ¬†neck cringing
I don't even like anime but why do people think that someone that just likes anime is an instant Weeaboo? Papa Franku put up the definition so read it!
Wait, this video has 4 million views but Frank only has about a million subs??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????¬†
We need to find these other 3 million and make them subscribe
My favorite anime is Jimmy Neutron
please note all weaboos present in this cmment section will be publicly executed and their body pillow and any anime/ manga related possession
I just wanted a piece of that helicopter's ass, XDD!
comments just because i have an anime character as my profile pic
Hey guys, is it necessary to learn Japanese if I go to Japan for an event/vacation? And Filthy Frank I need more guide to get de pusi, the methods you have shared has yet to work.
the asian chick orgasm thing made me shit my pants... literally
What he's actually saying in Japanese is hilarious. I think I heard a "I absolutely love vagina" in there somewhere xD


Also something like: "I have two hostages in my closet. They're both dying."
I feel like if you buy anime weapon collection your a real weaboo
ÂÜíÈ†≠„ÅÆÊó•Êú¨Ë™û„Åè„Åù„ÅÜ„Åæ„ÅÑwwwww
Nyesss
<------NOT ANIME FLASHING LIGHTS YEAHHHH!!!! TRANCE MUSIC FUCK YEEAAAAHHH!!! I'M A WINNER AT LIFE!!!11 EXPLOSIONS I DID IT MOM!!!! NAKED WOMEN LOOK AT ME!!!! DEAD PEOPLE YEAH!!! I'M THE FUCKING BOSS! CARPET I'M FREAKING AWESOME MAN! POOPOO FUCK ALL OF YOU! A PERFECT FLOWER I'M BETTER THAN ALL OF YOU!!!!!!! SANTA YES!!! FUCKING FUCK YEAH!!!!
This guy is really funny.

trenslate:

Hello you wonderful bastards
Lol, why do they cosplay? It's like a whale exhibit xD
Yeah.... and some people still think being an otaku is a good thing...
i dont have any anime weapons whatever its called, i dont have a body pillow, i dont have posters, i take a shower every 2 days, i only watch anime.
Oh my fuck, I think this particular sub was my favorite and most heart felt sub of all time.
R.I.P , Weeaboo Jones
4 millions wow
5:12 AHHAHAAH
Why are the weeaboos always fat? I don't get it.....
wtf lol
I laughed so hard at 4:09
My school is a safehaven where most people don't even know what anime is.
We have 1 weeaboo who came into school with a jumper that had printed on the back "Strawhat_(hisname)" and nobody knew what it meant.
I cringed and glared at him but noone knew why I didn't like his jumper so much.
I don't know if i should be happy that noone knows what weeaboos are or upset that we can't lynch them together.
Trueness, kinda feel stupid for having a anime avatar now
Cory in the House is the best anime
I once saw a girl with a katana on a train in holland.¬†
We were just sitting down in the seats and she comes past with her katana like its nothing.
welp.... thats enough internet for today guys :S
whatthe fuck i m doing here .. ?
omfg cory in the ass is anime?
i love this dude lol
I think you can consider it ironic that every second avatar in this comment section seems to be from a japanese anime.
yoo everyone commenting on this shit got an anime picture in their profile lol
Anime: Drugs would be cheaper
i am in fucking tears. this is too much. too perfect.
I don't watch anime that much I'm just here for the memes.
I'm not a weab but I really want to learn Japanese. It just sounds so interesting!
whats wrong with having a katana collection.
I like anime but not in to Japanese culture and don't get made at people for not liking anime
Dayum XD
I like the animes
I respect the culture
I dont like my own pictures so it use things like this in all my profile pics
But i know what i am, 30% 'Murican
And then a bunch of other shit like italian, german, sweedish, polish, etc
But born in the shitty US of 'Murica
I dont quite say shitty as in i think Japan is superior, but as of more recent years the US has been going downhill.... So its not the best, better than 3rd world countries though
wow he has two macbooks interesting
"you should notify your school" im fucking dying.
Lol my family is true Asians but don't have the eyes lol
I really can't believe these weeaboos
I don't understand why weeaboos got offended at this video, he has a right to say these things if you're offending his culture.
hey im a weeaboo and I don't try to say japanese stuff I just say them in my head
Cue the "I do all of this but I'm not a weeabo because__" comments
what is the music¬† which starts when you going to the weeaboo protection chamber lol
eY bOSS, gimme da pussy
Ugh, I dated a weeaboo üò®üî´
Fuck weeaboo's and everyone who watches anime.
fuck WEEABOOS
just mowed the grass while thinking of de pusi b0ss
Sid the science kid is the best anime
Everytime I get fed up with the cancerous 12 year olds on garrys mod. I come to filthy franks channel to feel like there is still some hope left in life. But then i realize there isn't and I die inside.
this guys the shit bro gotta thumbs up and subscribe
Everyone needs to see this :)
Incoming weaboos
Anime sucks¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
BEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE!
Thank you very much you dick! I watch anime alot, i learn Japanese properly and i love Japan and im not weeaboo. not everyone is a weeaboo! I respect your view but theres no need to call them disgusting and filthy and all that! your such a hypocrite and Theres no need for it. Idc what people will say about Otaku's and weeaboos just dont fucking make fun of things that people love! so dont be too quick to judge just cause you dont like them!
what was the song during the battle scene?
LOL! I sat next to a Japanese exchange student in my orchestra class and she would always tell me how annoying all of the Weaboos were. They would ask her questions about "dumb cartoons that nobody watches at home". She also hated how they thought they knew her culture, but really didn't. PS She didn't act like any anime character you will see in japanese anime. She was normal like most of us.
anime sux
And this, is how autism speaks.
How old is he even? Just curious
I bet all weaboos have smegma.
All you have to do is pretend you're Japanese and they start licking your feet
My favorite anime is High School Musical.

I love this channel.
Filthy Frank live on FOREVER.
fuck you all if you don't like filthy frank
Directly translated kancho directly translated means 1,000 years of pain

yamete kure xD
"rosetta stone"

This shit was funny as hell though, it's true that some people do go overboard with anime.
1k Weaboos
And watching anime and read manga counts?
Ok, then I'm a weeaboo
I go to school with so many fucking weeaboos lol there is this girl thats like "I watched all the anime on netflix, i love anime so much im going to learn japanese and move to tokyo"
... ;-;
THE AMOUNT OF ANIME FANS HERE
IS TOO DAMN HIGH
hahah funy meme rite
Turn on subtitles and read 1:02
i'm not a weeaboo....... wait i just player Project diva f 2nd for 6 hours straight............
Don't be sad, Frank. I wanted some of Percy's ass too.
Admit it It would be cool if pokemon was real
Wow weeaboos flippin suck
''there own''
Im not a weaboo but does my avatar count as me being a weaboo? I just like this drawing and thats it. Does it count?
You sound like a chronic smoker.
9:58
Is that fucking PBG
Preach, these filthy weeaboos make us normal people who just like watching anime (or insert any show that you like) look bad.
I just realized one of my classmates is a WEEABOOS and thats why me and everybody hates her.
I once fucked giraffe n it felt good      if i wanna know y its cause            girraffes gimme wood.                  her name was jennifer and she          									gave great head,one day i planned to do her on my bed. brought her home and my neighbors saw, it was then i realized had a great flaw. and im sittin home all sad, thinkin bout the girrafe pussy i coulda had.

I love it !
Yeah weeaboos are fucking weird. I don't think I want to understand why are they obsessed with Japan. Hell, I think one time I saw one say Japan should've won WW2. What?! Fucking weeaboos. Also, if you don't like anime it doesn't bug me because I don't care.
Maybe I should change my profile picture........ 
Don't want people getting the wrong idea about me.....
run before you become infected it's too late for me just run
As much as I agree with this because I know what kind of person you're talking about, I feel like I'm a weeaboo. I mean, I do enjoy Anime and Hentai, I'm interested in the Japanese culture, even though I don't believe I know too much yet, I would like to learn Japanese and maybe go some day, and I am interested in getting back into Karate training like I once was. But I don't annoy people, I don't say kawaii or stupid shit like that, I don't talk about senpais and all that. I'm not into furries, bronies, nothing. So am I a weeaboo?
still my favorite filthy frank video <3

Ok...  I am not a Weeaboo, I do want a katana, but because i practice sword-based martial arts, and at the same time, i want a italian side sword.  I want a cloak like kirito's cloak of midnight because i like the color scheme, and it will leave me better equipped for winter.  I would like to go to japan, but for their military and naval history museums, i would like to se the INS Mikasa, as it was used in the Russo-Japanese war.

Anyone else hear his voice crack at 1:04?
Weebabos in Japan are like: "Where are the subtitles?"... B0s, Chapeau!
Not all anime is the fucking same lol






You can't compare Lucky Star with Hellsing
Heavy breathing and fast keyboard typing
w w w w w w wheres the subtitles
Watching your videos is better than sex XD
Im gona start dressing up as a black man and I will only eat fried chicken, watermelon, watch the boondocks, go live in the hood, join a gang, and say fuck the police whenever I see a police officer. Is this okay?
Is being an Anglophile bad?
„Éï„É©„É≥„ÇØ„Åï„Çì„Å´‰ºö„ÅÑ„Åü„ÅÑÔºÅÔºÅ
if you are a weeaboo you should reconsider your life and kill yourself.
I fucking lost it when he started playing the recorder with his nose.
i would love if someone could make a video of all dizasta and tvfrank videos in chronological chromosome order
Some of us have an weaboo friend, but we ALL have that anime-friend.
I like watching DBZ but I'm not a weeaboo
<---I don't think this means i'm a weeaboo beacuse i like anime but i'm not interested on being fucking japanese, i never tried cossplaying beacuse i think looks so stupid, everyone in internet are such assholes so the internet doesnt matter but weeaboos are like real life nerds!
" I've had so much sex with my body pillow that it stands on its own now" fkn ded
Just curious, what does it make me if:

1. I like hentai, but don't watch any anime
2. I wouldn't purposefully buy a body pillow, but if someone were to gift me one as a gag gift, I would probably keep it.
3. ¬†I like some of the games.

And btw, Metalocalypse is best anime you w334b00 f@gg0t5.
make a video about those annoying faggot Jehovah witnesses
Watch this with subtitles
Everyone i know that this is a very very late comment, but Doctor Gorgeous Miller which is Frank saved our lives he is should've won a noble peace prize why because he helped all of our little confused assess to be ready to defend ourselves
im a americanbo. im german.
I mean, I studied Japanese since I was in first grade so I think I have the right to say I know quit a lot of Japanese. But yeah, I get what you mean: I love Japan, but I don't go crazy. Although I do wonder: is it normal, in Japan, for Japanese teenage boys to stash porn under their beds? And is DFrank actually 52? He does not look that old.
Cory in the house is still the best
wait how are frank and pink guy "taking care of it" when their original plan was to go into the protection chamber?









XD jk im no critic
The people who disliked this video were most likely weeaboos
When cry played this on his live stream
K
fnaf fans are worse, in my opinion.
I use anime avatars even tho im bearly watching any anime. Am i a weeaboo yet?
Anime is for losers.
I LOVE YOU XD
Now I feel sad that you couldn't become Thomas the Tank engine :(
God, I hate people with anime avatars so much.
Umm I can't help but see youre making fun of weeaboos... XD well you say all these things and they're all wrong:33. You say we're not Japanese because we weren't born in Japan that's wrong... >. > I'm spiritually Japanese( my Japanese name is Okami Kumatora xD). U also say we want to have sex with under age girlz Ya also wrong @.@ just because we watch hentai with under age girls doesn't mean we're attracted to them... Just like how bronys who watch pony porn aren't attracted to ponies XD(le bro hoof x3). So I hope you learned something my kawaii friend xD I'm off to watch Naruto bye squeee~! x33
What's that anime on 2:53
Spongebob is the best anime ( Õ°¬∞ Õú  ñ Õ°¬∞ )

U like my dank memes
Aww, you're so adorable!!
The Funniest part about this is he is right
"Omg, u fucking cunt, watashi wa animu fan nd u disrespect us. ugh kissa, baka baka. Fuck u and you neck beard desu."
CHILL FAM.
"Where are the subtitles?" I fucking died!!!!
The irony is all of the weeaboos posting in the youtube comments.
Am I a weeaboo for reading the Attack on Titan manga after the anime, or is that ok? Seriously
I feel kinda bad for these people in the pictures
Frank you can Play the hentai Girl very good ;P
0:09 there are two Jews in my closet, they are both dead. Jesus Christ this show is better with Japanese friends
You know, goths are almost like weeaboos.
This guy has the body movements and voice of a crazy character that can appear in any gta. Good video.
As much as I hate anime weeaboos I think pro wrestling smarks are worse, as weeboos cross into that territory watching Japanese pro wrestling and not understanding the cultural differences. No you weebs, NJPW is not the greatest thing ever just because the wrestlers use strong style.
Anime's for faggits
I have this really huge weeaboo at my school, and even though I'm not Japanese I hate her because she so freaking annoying. I want to tell her to stop, but she's to sensitive. Can you please help me Frank???üòÑ
What about the FNAF fanbase
So many lost lives
Absolutely the best video on YouTube
Umm I can't help but see youre making fun of weeaboos... XD well you say all these things and they're all wrong:33. You say we're not Japanese because we weren't born in Japan that's wrong... >. > I'm spiritually Japanese( my Japanese name is Okami Kumatora xD). U also say we want to have sex with under age girlz Ya also wrong @.@ just because we watch hentai with under age girls doesn't mean we're attracted to them... Just like how bronys who watch pony porn aren't attracted to ponies XD(le bro hoof x3). So I hope you learned something my kawaii friend xD I'm off to watch Naruto bye squeee~! x33
Is Rachael Dozale an example because she claims she black
At my school
Lol reality check
This Video Blowes
I do karate and kendo and I love Japanese culture. I am an American who wants to travel to Japan to see the Tokyo city with my own eyes. I envy the intelligence and abilities  that they have. As you talked  about sword collecting, I was thinking to myself that I collect weapons for my love of karate and kendo. Oh and by the way... I love your videos. New sub:)
weeaboos are fucking trash
WOAHWOAHWOAH FRANK TOO FAR CHILL OUT YOU CAN MAKE FUN OF ANYTHING BUT ANIME
One like me? ;)
seriously,fuck weeaboos. Stupid ass motherfuckers
Kage Bunshin No Jutsu
Papa Frank, I am laughing so hard. Thank you for the video, Papa Frank!
Hey frank, make fun of furries now. They have twice as many chromosomes than weaboos
frank's 52? no way
My favourite anime shows are magic school bus and g.i. Joe
6? GET ON MY LEVEL BAKA
I only just noticed the Wacom tablet. WHAT KINDA FUCKEN MORON AM I
emmerdale is my favorite anime
Weeaboos are satin
"Ra-rasengan... is that a stone?"
Hail satan
I think all the Weeaboos should form a rebel against people like this.
I now hate most of my friends T_T
And they aren't weeaboos
oh lordi
Never knew what a Weeaboo was until now. I had been a fan of anime for a while now; let's say about 5 years. Thanks +TVFilthyFrank for showing me the way.
I'm an anime fan myself, but in regard to weeaboos this is EXTREMELY accurate . Funny too. Don't forget funny.
Moeshit anime is cancer.
I think your funny
Hm, not sure why collecting weapons is red flaggish, but alright.

Anyways, great video papa franku
I agree on all except for the weapons. I mean I have a set of shruikens that I throw along with a tomahawk for sport
This video just earned you my Like XD, Even though i am almost a weaboo. Hell of video.
I like how 90% of people commenting are weeaboo's because they have anime characters as profile pic's lol
tem algum br nessa porra ?
time to recive hate, i fucking hate animae except for the boondocks. theyre funny as shit
iCarly is the best anime you uneducated fucking normies
jeez
i swear i saw pbg and tobuscus in the weeaboo song montage
Is there such thing as a body pillow without any pictures on it cause I just want one.. Idk it seems comfortable cause it is the size of yourself so you can just hug it.... If so i wonder if its at bed bath and beyond.
4:10 I'm not gonna lie, this sounded ripped straight from an anime or something. I know it was to make fun of it, but shit.

Then again, I'm probably the only one who thinks this. Lol.
Strange. He looks like a half japanese
Papa Franku plz do an episode on furries. I know you don't want autism but there are too many extra chromosomes to ignore them. Please enlighten the world on autistic furries.
Greatest video I've ever seen
gimme that ukelele you bloody weeabo!
Yeah, I bet everyone here has watched Dragonball before lol
>I was only 2000000000 chromosomes old
>I loved Franku so much, I had all the merchandise and the Pink Guy album
>I pray to Frank every night before bed, thanking him for the life I've been given
>"Franku is love" I say; "Frank is life"
>Dade hears me and makes random noises
>I know he was just pleased for my devotion to Franku
>I called him a b0ss
>He makes more random noises and sends me to sleep
>I'm diagnosed with cancer now, my life hurts
>I lay in bed and it's autistic
>Suddenly, a warmth is moving towards me
>It's Franku
>I am so happy. He whispers into my ear "ey b0ss. gibe de pusi."
>He grabs me with his powerful Franku hands and puts me down onto my hands and knees
>I'm ready
>I spread my ass-cheeks for Frank
>He penetrates my butt-hole
>It hurts so much but I do it for Frank
>I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water
>I push against his force
>I want to please Frank
>He sings a mighty song as he fills my butt with his love
>Dade walks in
>Frank looks him straight in the eyes and says "fuk u mang"
>Franku leaves through my window
>Frank is love. Frank is life.
Why are you so funny
Am I A a weeaboo? I don't consider myself gross and pervy and I don't really care if people don't like anime. But I am learning Japanese so I can go to school in Japan but I wanted to do that ever since I was like five. I understand moving to Japan + speaking Japanese and watching a few animes doesn't make me Japanese. I'll still be an American just American who lived in Japan and speaks Japanese. I'm not trying to become Japanese for change my culture..... So I think I'm good!
So Anime haters likes to bully anime fans that likes anime then calling us Weeaboos. It sickens me. Its sickens me to the cold because all you anime haters mostly like Amarican Cartoon fans makes fun of Anime Fans that likes Japanese anime with english subtitle. Dumbass people calling me a Weeaboo just because of my Proflie name and my Favorite Anime Picture. It doesn't make any fucking sense at all. I love Japanese anime alot more than American cartoons. But when i was little i love the Americans cartoon shows like Cartoon Network and Nickoldean shows. But now i gotten older, Anime such as Dragon Ball z change me to watch alot more anime.
I sometimes read Manga too like Naruto Shippuden. I don't have a problem with people learning Japanese, dress like Japanese and etc. But anime fans ARE NOT WEEABOO AND THAT'S MY OPINION. You anime haters are just making fun of us and Bullying us. THIS SHIT HAS TO STOP. Oh and Anime Expo is for people that dresses like anime, anime fans, manga, Anime video game reviews, and etc. So this word called "Weeaboo" is not even a word. Just a stupid makeup word for Anime Haters. My opinion is that Anime Expo is not for Weeaboos. THIS SHIT NEED TO STOP.
Hot Damn, these are real tears. I cried myself to sleep laughing. thank you
This guy earned my sub.
Everyone wanted a piece of percy's ass...
Weeaboos should calm down and downgrade to a normal anime fan :/, i mean i only own one anime thing XD
I turned subtitles and weeabo translates to weirdo
Coincidence i think not.
My favorite anime is Kappa Mikey!
That's your opinion, but I hate people who limited their minds to explore every thing, I can't stand seeing this. you hate them, then don't watch them, but some times you got to free your mind, but right now your feeding trolls more and more to hate on anime, games that are from Japan, like kingdom hearts, and final fantasy. Their people that I hate, I hate people who are liars, dishonest, cheaters, and trolling. I should say that you suck, but it make me better not to say it because it's better not to be in there own shoes. It's best not to be at your own level, because that I am more mature then you. This is your own opinion, and this comment is my own opinion. You and your fans may dislike this comment, but you know that I'm right that your going to be a troll just like other trollers. That is all.
I used to be a weeaboo, but I grew the fuck up and made it out alive.

I offer counseling and guidance in exchange for tentacle porn.
What is the song he plays on the assflute at 6:20?
Ur voice...ewwwwww
Turn on subtitles and go to :56
Help me!¬†http://wh.gov/i9w20
Fuckin' salamander man... lmao
5:11 lol
Anime is still ass though...... 

Aside from from a few, not many can be taken seriously. It's always teenagers in love triangles trying to save the world. Or terrible writing and animation.

But Ghibli's films are great along with some other Japanese studios who make full movies.
I fuckin love your channel frank weeaboos is accurate asf Iol, just subscribed like 2 hours ago man and love your shit man keep it up üëç +TVFilthyFrank
First Filthy Frank video I've ever watched. All the cancer and autism just sort of spiralled out from there. Once you go filthy you never go back.
I love Cory in the House :D It's my favourite anime
I can't help but laugh so hard
6:56
Weabs
HUHUHUHUHUHUHUH *Type type type*
so... most of my friends around me are... weeaboos
now i'm scared a little o-o
anime fags that call people that knows that anime sucks 'newfags'
.-.
Well, I'm kinda feeling like shit for getting Rosetta Stone...
FF: dreams never come true..
MG: DREAM KILLER ;-;
but i still love you your awesome
I suggest u do a video of pink guy on the bus
hey frank big fan!
I felt like I walked into a surrealist art project halfway into this.
corri n da huse best animu evr
so its okay for me to like the culture and learn about it? I'm trying to be trilingual, because Japanese and Mandarin is the future and helps you get a job. It was either Japanese or Mandarin- so i chose what I liked most and what was easy (my friend is learning Mandarin, and she cries after every class). I speak Spanish and English, both pretty good languages. I also like anime and manga...
This guy calls weeaboos borderline pedophiles when he took a child's phone number of the internet, called her and sang to her saying "You Like That Baby". Btw I am not a weeaboo.
Frank is 52?
This guy should be shot
I watch Tokyo Ghoul but im not a weeaboo lol
Anime is for trash loser kids who have no life. All weaboos should burn in hell. grabs popcorn
You know you're watching the Worst show on the Internet when the show stops for a pigeon.
This guy seems mentally disabled/challenged.
i lost my shit at 7:40 haha
We need to contact Adult Swim and get Filthy Frank his own TV show.
Oh lord!I think I have this weeabooboo thing.
That is insane :)
What is Seinfeld??
Can't help but notice at 8:57 there are two characters from anime I recognise. On the left most side of the screen is Louise from Zero No Tsukaima and Mia(Nia?) from Gurren Lagann.
I'm a weeaboo.
C:
holy fuck the amount of autists trying to defend themselves in the comments is staggering
Fuck, I have an anime profile picture on my steam...

welp its time for self-immolation for chin-chin
10:09
Waaaait. Is that Christian Chandler? I thought that guy had an actual mental disease.
I'm not even mad :D
The fuck is anime? I watch cartoons¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
This is my house.
is that chris chan!!?
god tier taste Cory in the house and they say there is no perfect anime.
I only got one Katana from an anime n thats it.
And usually when I type and start flame wars it's not to other people who dont watch anime. I do type on my keyboard really fast. I type to other anime fans
Franku, you're becoming too popular, all these faggot weeaboos are coming in and are trying to imitate you, they are ruining your fanbase man.
there's three levels: anime fan, otaku, weaboo

An anime fan just likes anime. ex. "hey bro, saw some Cory in the House, my favorite anime"

Otakus go from "otaku pride" ex. "bro, otakus are the best!" to denial after learning the real meaning. ex. "I'm not an otaku!" to acceptance ex. "yeah, I'm an otaku, not proud of it though"

Then, there are weaboos who never hit the third otaku stage and went overboard and obsessed "WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY FAGGOT!? DID YOU JUST SAY CORY IN THE HOUSE AND OTHER ANIME ARE STUPID!!???!?11! I'LL KILL YOU!! YOU HAVE NO DESU KAWAIINESS YOU BAKA!!"

Please, if you ever tread down the path of anime, don't become a weaboo....
Filthy Frank should make a video about bronies. He would express so much hate for them that the comment section can't hold enough hater comments.
God damn, how did I just find this? This is perfect.
Weaboos are terrifying, I don't want to learn English, drink tea, and move to England just because I watch Doctor Who. jeeze.
This was so funny I shit myself
Doesent this guy get seizures from this? Like.. isnt this serious√∏y bad for his health?
Only losers watch anime. People who watch anime are trash lmao.
WEEABOOS ARE FUCKING AWESOME M8!! IM A FUCKING WEEABOO DESPITE LEARNING JAPANESE. I SPEAK JAPANAESE HENTAI IS LIFE ANIME AVATARS ARE AWESOME IM BREATHING RALLY HEAVY AND IM TYOIGN FAST AND I COANT SPELL BXUZ IM TYPING FAST FUCK UR PIGION BITCCH JAPAN IS LOVE, Japan is life. :)
Japanese people don't speak like that, as you said but, Yakusa sure makes it hard not to stereo type them.
it sounds like it hurts his voice to talk like that

that sauske cosplay is killer tho
God I hate those idiots you have anime pictures...
<----
Franky i used to be japanesu weeaboo warrior, i collected swords and knives, learned japanese (like 3 words or something) played shit games from koei and even disgaea (please kill me in the past) and i wanted to decorate my house in japanese style and im not making this up. But one day i evolved from this state and became fucking awesome by throwing all that crap out the window.¬† Thank you frank, p.s. you look super hot when you cosplay as filthy frank. saikyo franku ichi ni san shi chi shi shi whatev subarashi tengoku ayy lmao, your biggest fan calamaistr.
gimme de pussy b0ss
You are an annoying version of sawyer but you are funnier than sawyer so...your move...
Wait so frank I still can't be Thomas

Ymmm.. What the fucking fuck?

shuffles away
My avatar is Levi from Attack On Titan...
can we all agree that the youtube user Magicalpockyusagi is the worst Weeaboo of all?
So this is where the Cory in the House anime thing came up... oh God.
I feel like their is much crossfire in this video, I'm pretty sure this video has caused a kinda trend where if someone watches anime they are automatically a Weaboo. Am I right? One of my friends (Not really friend) is a hard core christian who is really aggressive towards gays, atheist and Weaboos funny cause I'm a atheist. Multiple accounts I've seen everyday anime lovers been called out as a Weaboo and its pretty unfair to be classified as something when your not and disrespected because of it can we please stop this trend filthy frank himself said multiple times that he doesn't have anything against anime just doesn't like people who just outright disregard their culture and thinks their Japanese PS. I don't watch anime I just hate the ignorant comments and things people say to anime watchers
Do Japanese people watch this?
FilthyFrank sounds hilarious when he speaks Japanese.
My friend is a weeb... She also pronounces everything in Japanese wrong.. And thinks English music is terrible. Like seriously? I mean I don't watch anime anymore, nor listen to Japanese music that much. Sigh... I can't stand her...
Weeaboo Jones, oh well there goes the last name's reputation...
11:18
That awkward moment when you are thrown in jail dressed as Sauske (I dunno how it is spelt. c:) with giant ass gang members.
"What are you in for?"
"Throwing fake ninja stars at police cars and trying to use martial arts on an officer....Don't hurt me."
Lol
I masturbate to cory in the house every single night. I do it so hard my semen is brown
lol dumb Weebs
yeah make a bad name of us sentai rider fans

This guys IS jap so you gotta listen I him
loved this video. i enjoy anime but now i kinda wanna avoid watching too much of it. the fight though had me dying. damn this is good shit.
Cory in the house üòÇüòÇ
ƒ∞ am watching this for support while taking an insane SHIT
You're now my favorite YouTuber. Don't stop these videos. They make my day.
which one is the worstest? otaku or weeaboos?
What if i made My own props from Attack on titan?
9:11 (what a coincident) "i look like a bad ass with my new sword"¬†
correct version: i look like a fat ass with my new sword.

thank you.
FUCK ALL WEEABOOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Prejudice equality should be a thing.
My friend is a full out weeaboo and he's like 12 he just watches anime does kendo and learns Japanese and Normally pronounces it wrong reads Manga every day and watches anime and dreams of marrying a Japanese woman and going to Japan please help me eradicate my weeaboo friend how do I kill him
This was hilarious. XD

But I didn't understand some photos used towards the ending song (which was funny lol). I mean, not only Japanese are allowed to cosplay, right?
Breathes heavily and loud ITS NOT ASIAN CARTOONS ITS FRIKIN JAPANEESE CARTOONS JESUS RESPECT THE CULTURE AND THEIR GOD BUDDHA LIKE BUDDHA CHRIST. YOU ALL NEED A Inhales loudly A LIFE!
Thank you frank, weeaboos are so defensive and uptight. You say anything about them, an they flip out. Just like some people in these comments.
b0ss make a sequel called furries
Nani the fuck did you just fucking iimasu about watashi, you chiisai bitch desuka? Watashi‚Äôll have anata know that watashi graduated top of my class in Nihongo 3, and watashi‚Äôve been involved in iroirona Nihongo tutoring sessions, and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores. Watashi am trained in kanji, and watashi is the top letter writer in all of southern California. Anata are nothing to watashi but just another weaboo. Watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has never been mimasu‚Äôd before on this continent, mark watashino fucking words. Anata thinks anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto? Omou again, fucker. As we hanashimasu, watashi am contacting watashino secret netto of otakus across the USA, and anatano IP is being traced right now so you better junbishimasu for the ame, ujimushi. The ame that korosu‚Äôs the pathetic chiisai thing anata calls anatano life. You‚Äôre fucking shinimashita‚Äôd, akachan.
HARRO. MAI NAME IZ. COWBOY¬†„Åü„Å™„Åã
Whats with the weeaboo shit going on the comments?
Haro my namu isu cowboy tanaka
I'll admit, I used to be a full on weeaboo when I was younger...
Maybe that's why the Weeaboo Jones part freaked me out because of my last name 0__0
Senpai, teach me Japanese :(
Hello darkness my old friend...
I don't care if people hate anime. However, it does get annoying when people say they hate it without having seen any. That applies to pretty much anything people claim to hate without having actually seen/read it, though.

The people who insert random Japanese words into their speech are the worst. Certain words like shounen, shoujo, josei, etc. are necessary when discussing manga, though.@__@

On another note, I think Frank would make an awesome voice actor. =O
the hapa rage is real.
ight be dumb but what is rasetta stone from

Kinda ironic how everyone in the comment section has anime pics and names, also if you have an anime character or a pony then your opinion counts for 1/3 of a normal persons
if im chinese... then can i be japanese? cuz i look asian? and every asian looks the same to white ppl?
6:56 the best moment ever
4:09 ¬†lol my mom does xD
sword art online was complete Shet

I just hate all anime in general.

Looking through these comments I now notice how many people have anime profiles lol
I'd say you are just as intense as most weeaboos
Shout out to the frontal orb crotch we see every con

R-Rosetta Stone
He sounds hot
who the hell do you think you are?! some people are really into japan. i am learning japanese and i can even speak it correctly. you are sad to talk about people who are totally into japan. japan is an amazing country and its not a problem to love it. you are making us sound like bad people for loving japan immensely. go to hell.
Isn't anime is  from japan and cartoon is from europe

He could probably actually become a voice actor. Pft I'd watch that anime. üëå
rip weeaboo jones
I have an anime profile picture because I like the character. Please don't assume everyone who has an anime profile picture is one of... those people. You know, the ones who don't have lives so all they do is complain on the internet when someone makes fun of their favorite anime or just anime in general. I am an Otaku and I still love 'Murican culture. Being rude is fun, lol. Anyways... Keep up the good work. üëç
Wow! This weeaboo business is some serious shit.
I'm offensive and i find this weeaboo, fuck frank you
The people that dislike frank (I was one of them) for 13 mins Have no sense of humor
Keep doing your thing Frank

Lol that was so funnyüòÄ
I think here's a fine line between liking something and wanting to be a part of that culture...I mean,for example, I like some british shows/movies/merch ect...does this mean I WANT to be part of that culture ?? NO, people can like things and not be obsessed with everything related to it
Wait there are people like this?

I thought there were just people who liked anime a lot. Not something this far.
Read the text at 9:28 lol a true weeaboo
Especially the SAO fanfag community, every sao BITCH keeps infecting the anime "community"with their BS saying "OMGGG SAO IS TEH BEST WATCH CAUSE FUCK THE OTHER ANIMES THIS ONES BEATZZZ ALLS THE ANIMEZ OUT THERE!!"

*flashes peace sign while giggling like a little girl *
You would be a great Anime voice actor
the reverse weeaboos are here...
I came to this comment section, and everywhere I see.  Weeaboos.  Except for you op.
I love seeing him break character like even he knows how fucking funny it is he cant hold himself together
Am I a weeaboo?
so.... one time on fb I was in this loz group. (legend of Zelda for you uncultured fags) and I made a post showing off a mastersword I handmade that was actually functional and shit cause why have a sword you cant use? this girl commented that I was cute or some shit even tho my picture was me and my fianc√© but I just kinda ignored it. she commented again 5 minutes later talking about japan. (she was straight outta mexico or some shit she could barely type English properly. or she was retarded which wouldn't surprise me.) she was fat and disgusting and I could just feel the spaghetti falling outta her pockets onto her anime body pillow that's encrusted with rotten ass and vagial cum probably. disgusting. anyway, she¬†mentions she wants to move to japan and find the perfect boy to make her husband. ofcorse she was talking about pop star looks and perfect manners, lots of money etc. way out of her league. the most disgusting pedophile koku gin out there is to good for her disgusting ass. I mention I can speak alittle japanee since she brought it up. yes I watch anime and read manga and study alittle on Japanese culture and language, but im no expert or nothing. so she keeps on telling me about her soon to be Japanese bf. she can barely speak English and she wants to go to japan? dafuq? lol. I look at her profile. she has like 13 friends and for the past few months has been making posts about moving to japan and posting pictures of good looking Japanese guys saying their her husband or some shit. also posts about doing the rossetta stone thing, which she cant hardly speak English so yea lmao. her very few friends would comment on her post saying how shes full of shit and stuff lol. she ends me a friend request and like, stalks me for a few days. I keep declining her and eventually block her. my fianc√© actually wrote her a huge angry message too lmao. but yea, my weeaboo horror story. fuck you fags idc if you didn't like my story I told you anyway.
I am zee anime hunter
da fuq??
ok i have to ask if you like anime and you do cozplay but at places like comic con does this still make you a weeaboo ?
Hetalia is the best anime ever!
We all know why male weeaboos exist
spam the number 4 while watching the video ahahahahahahahahahahahah
I cri evry taim
The bee movie is my favorite anime
Filthy frank knows what's going on. I learn many things from you frank. You are my role model. Thank
What the Fuck was this video ?
I like how in one of his old videos, he's like, "I hate Asians," and when he mimics them, he uses stereotypical gibberish i.e., "Ling pong ding dong" When the guy speaks fluent Japanese.. So, If you're telling me Filthy Frank isn't a genius, I don't believe you're autistic enough to understand.
Ehh,the weapons thing is okay in moderation. For example, if you collect weapons generally, having a katana or two isn't unacceptable, and you might be a little weird for collecting weapons, but you can't collect exclusively katanas or stuff like that.
I fap to hentai
Why does frank hate when we collect weapons?
I JUST WANT UR APPROVAL SENPAI
I LOVE THIS-
I only like one anime, but my friend is a total fucking weeb you should see her
I want to drive my Thomas the train into Frank's tunnel
what is this horseshit, its funny
Weeaboos are fagets
i feel you that helicopter has a nice booty
Shitty fanbase
If I had a katana..... I'd probably use it to cut watermelon... nah.. i'd never get a Katana. I'm not to be trusted with scissors let alone swords.
i just wanted a peice of percys ass stares sadly
There are hot fucking weaboos but they are annoying as shit
I feel like this was meant to be a serious video but then dropped acid half way through
Soon, we will get more subs Papa Franku.
I wanted to be Thomas the Tank Engine too. I like trains.
Them graphics and sound effects tho
My favorite anime is Two and a Half Men.
Papa Franku, you need to make a rant on bronies
You saved my lyfe
+TVFilthyFrank  Can you please tell me the song that plays when Weeaboo Jones enters? Thank you.
WEEABOOS suck ok?
end of story
CAPTIONS CHANGE WEABOOS TO WEAVERS WHYYYY
The best anime is obviously infomercials
Ok so I don't actually like anime, but what is the joke of calling Cory in the house anime? I love the joke, and I know it's obviously not anime, but what is the point of the joke?
you kinda sound like Italy
Wtf is Anime?
I wonder how sore your throat must be after these videos?

PREACH IT, HONEY.
This is actually pretty fucking funny.
He should make one of these about bronies or furries. That should be fun. He doesn't talk shit about them as much.
It's kind'a ironic/sad how plenty of weeaboos migrate here like an obese fucker migrating for some Mcnuggets, and act like it's alright to them. Deep inside they're cringing as fuck, very edgy; commenting to ensure their insecurities.

God has abandoned us all, and left us with chronic cancer, the weeaboo and koreaboo cancer.
Don't worry guys trust me it is just a phase. Source: me (ex-weeaboo)
this channel is the fucking best

Shoutout to all the weaboos who are upset that Japan lost the World Cup to the USA.
uhh..koni..konichiwa.uhuh..rosetta stoone
does watching anime that only have english dubs count as being a weeaboo? I wouldn't think so but...
I LOVED F.R.I.E.N.D.S, It was an epic anime
I don't know what the fuck I just watched, but it was far too real.
chris chan is more like a sonicaboo
That was a super good sub impression around 4:17
Kill that fucking pigeon next time
My sister is a weeaboo üòÇ
That song was beautiful
Anime sucks
I don't know what's worst
Comic book nerd who keep there precious collection in plastic and mastubathe to wonder women or weeaboos.
This comment section gave me cancer. I demand compensation.
I am so fucking sick of frank's fanbase. they all spout the same spergy unfunny bullshit like "my favorite anime is¬†(insert something that's not anime)" "LE WRONG GENERATION" "non sequitur about someone or something dying" and other gay shit. most of them are animu obsessed degenerates, kids who still think that montage parodies are funny, facefags, and¬†unfunny¬†autists¬†who think that browsing¬†an imageboard that¬†should've been abandoned once sjw fuckers started¬†becoming mods¬†is the greatest thing on earth. in short, I love you frank, but your fanbase is 100000000% cancer.
I only learn Japanese, Spanish, French and all that because I want to be a genesis and I might have to learn different languages btw I'm only twelve so yeh that's probably why
i want to see franks take on wiggers
I like all the weebs with anime profile pictures acting like they arent as big of a cancer as the rest of that community.
Does anybody know the anime at 1:17? Thanks
are we a WEEABOO if we like techno and shit considering that they have a lot of japan shit concerned around it?
He acts exactly like a black guy I go to school with. I wouldn't have mentioned that he was black if it wasn't for the fact that it shows all cultures have crazy people.
Please fucking die you piece of shit your voice his the worst 2 did you like get fucked in the face
How the fuck have I not yet seen this XD
Yo. I love you. You're absolutely nuts. Fucking love it :D
Cory In the House #BestAnime
He should tackle bronys
mane dis shit is da funny thang
Anyone know where the music at 6:43 is from?
Weeabronies are worse tbh. They walk on all fours.
I know it isn't everybody but why is it that the most racist, autistic shit in YouTube comments are typed up by people with anime profile pictures
I have sent this video to 7 people already. This video works wonders.
kage bunshin no jutsu 8-|
omg watching this in x0.5 speed is hilarious XD
I am a deutshlandophile. I sing the German national anthem while playing minecraft. Still better than being a weeaboo.
I like Seinfeld and Cory in the house. Also, this is the truth about weeaboos.
That's a want a be in Japanese like people want to be Japanese
I find it hilarious when Frank is japanese and the weebs feel they can relate to him.
I saw someone yesterday at my school talking like this 4:09. Should I be worried?
please make an episode that you're not gonna speak English but Japanese. put some subtitles as well.
I come to Japan for a time, i see a lot of weeaboos here in a game center
i'm scared¬†
help
i looked in the comment section and its a sea of people with their waifu/anime profile pics saying how weaboos are trash. if you are going to say that at least change the picture.
I just wanna piece of ¬†Percy's ass you feel me ?
People are saying the mlp fan base is shit. And I agree, but In the name of anything ever, I will say this. I am the first ever brony to be chill about what I like. I don't rub it in your face. What I'm trying to say is, I am the only brony in existence who you can stand to be around for more than five minutes. Yay me. I am a rare breed.
What kills me the most is those people who spam their hentais all over google+.


And don't even get started on the weeaboos that lose their shit when you say you prefer the English dub of a show. They claim that the Jp version is more emotional or powerful or what have you, but they still can't understand the language. The fact that they have to read subs to begin with means they don't understand the language and how it's supposed to sound or be spoken in a specific context. So if a JP dub is bad, they're being blind to the fact that it's bad and they're only watching it because it's Japanese because they're FUCKING WEEABOO TRASH
fucking crying at waking the neighbors up x,D

Oh and to all the people that are saying that this world is better without then.... Please oh please let some random dude come and find and smack the shit out of you. Don't be acting like everything is the end for you when people you know hates you.... There's one simple way to get that shit out of your fucking system of depression and pathetic shitness in your brain...... Go find new people and become a new your by starting over your characteristicts and personalities...... Goddamn I fucking hate the fact that people are depress then they fucking cut themselves and get negative and shit like wtf... Grow the fuck up and start fucking over like really. Reality check is what all you people really need
OK look people lets get this shit straight alright....... Guys with the katanas and swords thinking that you have powers and shit, shut the fuck up and get a fucking reality check like dafuq bro? Really? Get your fucking mind out of some other dudes ass thinking your special alright your not ten anymore so you can stop the child's play with this shit and start by getting a job and to move out of your moms house. Its fucking pathetic how you think you have the imagination of thinking that anime characters can be your "waifu" or whatever the fuck you weeaboos say it. I mean like I watch anime but I don't go into the internet saying that this my waifu and she so perfect. Dude like quit that shit and start reliving your fucking life guys like really

Now it seems like everyone else is unfiltered.

Even my mother got quite emotional with my bro's gf.¬†

Emotions ran high and she went off on an anti-transvestite rantocalypse.

my sister is weaboo.. please gimme advice how to kill her...
I lost it at that first joke
Lol, look at all these weeaboo hater comments, I love some anime, but I watch them in English, and I only watch a few: GGO/SAO 2 and Kill La Kill, these are some of the best shows I have seen in a long time, but I'm not obsessed with them... Lol, u people realize Frank really doesn't care what u say, he's got enough subs, and doesn't need u, he's awesome, and hilarious... Pretend to be Japanese all u want, but those anime girls will never be your girlfriend, cuz they don't exist... REALITY CHECK! Get your life together, listen to what Frank says, k?
The best part is that 90% of your fanbase used anime profile pics. I'm not saying you're wrong or that it's not cancerous, but just picture all the heavy fucking breathing going on right now.
Like an Asian pretending to be a white cowboy? More like a Samurai using a rapier
Im dying XD
9:58 is that pbg
WOW thats sad... #HUSTLERLIFE4EVA!!
i like building weapons from anime that look cool and that can help
I'd love to see a cowboy-wannabe jap. Fun times.

Filthy frank is rapidly growing in subs like 2 months ago he was at like 640,000 hrs at 880,000 he's gonna be at 1,000,000 by the end of the summer hopefully
WEEABOOS, NOW FURRIES!
I dont like anime only yugioh dragon ball and thats it but honestly my least favorit is sword art something and the Titan one
We should've skipped the '90s...
Ok, I would collect katanas but I'd least not waste my money just collecting them than using them!
Weeaboos are worse than people who have a brazzers premium and don't share it with the bois
7:53 its Connivers kunai and half-zatoichi from tf2! :D
+TVFilthyFrank , if weeaboos are a shit, you need to se what is a clooper
I don't really understand the whole pillow thing. Where did that even come from?
Oh my god... I just realized my friend is a weaboo. Not on the extreme level, but he collects japanese weapons (well, some different types of weapons like scimitars and flintlocks) he sometimes wears a kimono (but it's not like he does it at school, just at festivals, cosplay conventions and stuff.) he has a different anime character for all his profile pictures, holy shit he is! And he's adopted the mindset that he's Asian, although he's probably joking. Well, the guy's still cool to hang out with. He can be a weaboo, whatever.
Wait so If I have an L necklace am I a weeaboo? Oh, btw the name yeah ignore that fact shit.
That moment where he talks about the avatars I scrolled down to find nothing but the truth.
I keep rewatching this video just to hear his perfect anime voice <3
2:36 XD
The only question is why you have a pink wig and... a thing that involves Japanese school girls...
you're parents must be proud of you
Yeeeeeess
frank y must u be racist towards the pigeons ?
Weaboos are the best example of irony in the modern world simply because Japan was for some time amazingly xenophobic, in 1617 shogun Ieyasu started persecuting Christians during the climax of which an entire town of Christians were killed after revolting and not a single person in that was left alive, they then placed an inscription reading "so long as the sun shall warm the earth, let no christian be so bold as to come to Japan; and let all know that the king of Spain himself, or the Christian's God or the great god of all, if he violates this command, shall pay for it with his head." The Japanese then expelled all foreigners from their lands in fear that others might revolt, thus for ¬†200 years no foreigner ever visited Japan and all trade made with Japan was done on an heavily guarded island that acted as a shipyard for any foreign trade (excluding the dutch).The few foreign officials that were exempt from this were constantly humiliated. All of this was done simply out of xenophobia yet weaboos celebrate Japan's "historic and beautiful culture"
How does he come up with this shit hahaahah hilarious
Attack on titan sucks ass.
GRABS POCPRON...
I hate people who pretend there annother ethnic group' Not even being interested or informed about it. I can respect people That I know' That are interested In Nordic mythology and Thorism. But they don't fap to thor and his hammer' TL:DR Don't pretend to be from annother nationality. I fully agree with you filthy frank.
Holy shit. I like anime and I wanna go to Japan, but it's not because I like anime. I'm actually really curious about what it's like in Japan. I would love touring the city and shit.
When I happen to come across one of these filths I have to immediately come here and purify myself by watching this video.
I ... I have an anime style profile picture... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO lol jk i don't even watch anime.
Alot of people mistake me for a weeaboo but im not . Its because of the avatar and the japanese name right !? Im just a gamer furry otaku hipster .
Anime avatars are gay and stupid lmao.
@ 2:32 -- listen up rachel dolezal
Anime is anighey
Anime sucks.
Why are weeaboos commenting on this hating on weaboos?
It would also help if people didn't call everyone who watches anime a Weaboo.
Can someone please tell me the song at 5:58 ? thanks.... Edit: Found song I was looking for.... Black Hawk Down - Opening Theme (Somalia 1993)
LOL his Japanese is pretty spot on.
I'm so glad there is a name for them now.
Wow he sounded just like a fkin anime guy XD Like jesus christ.
Is Filthyfrank a reverse weaboo woth fucked up mind ? #dearpapafrankupleaseanswermeandfuckhashtag
The war between Filthy Frank and Weeaboos is worse than the Cold War.

Papa Franku saved me from becoming weeaboo trash
Rasagan..Rosetta Stone
I love anime, but not to a point where I stop watching hockey.
A weeaboos one weakness is really good anime like BERSERK, Cowboy Bebop, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, or my favorite Cory in the House
My teacher is a weeaboo
I always wondered, whats with Frank's voice?
4:26 I feel you
God Bless You Frank You Magnificent Bastard
Strangest Best video I've watched today.
I like anime, asking as its dubbed and has nothing to do with high school
breathing really heavy typing really fast I will fuck you up
That guy at 9:48 was arrested for possession of child pornography

I'm not afraid to admit that I wept
+Double4anime¬†+ForneverWorld¬†+Sawyer7mage¬†Can you guys react to this :)
P.S tenten sucks

and kaguya vs chouchou
Does anyone else think Frank would be a monster in bed
It's not a epidemic, it's really a birdemic flock of diseased trash trying to say killing themselves is cool!
I thought you were going to say that anybody who watches anime is a weeaboo for a second.

Hey boss
one famous weeaboo:¬†Venus Angelic
How did I end up here ???
in my class lately two guys came up and said they wanted to visit japan some day and that they are such nice people and so world open... they haven¬¥t even listened when I said they are pretty racistic (wenophobic like franku said~)
I seriously hate weeabos
So it's a red flag to collect weapons? WELL FUCK YOU TOO.
where am i?
better than chris chan
If you cosplay everyday or at least 5 days a week you're a weeaboo
But why do they hate showering though?
This entire video is wonderful
Its funny how all this low life nerds take this shit sireous lol
This had me laughing just from the first scene omfg I'm dead.
weeabos live in attics, all day every day. i love trolling em. gg no re
I watched dbz and then never delved deeper into the maniacal world of anime. I am a survivor.
funniest part 2:45-2:55
Jesus Christ !
Where have you been all my fucking life !?!?!?!?
weeabos should of this planet.
I am mad scientist. Ya  sonofabich
weeaboos suck ass
Are you really 52?
Omg i understand japanese and what he was saying at the beginning of the vid is hilarious XD
Hey @tvfilthyfrank the world is changing, white women can dress black and become spokespeople for the NAACP, Bruce Jenner can just become a woman like that, and people can dress as weeaboos
Can you redo the video pls and take out chris chan?
Chris chan isn't a weeabo, he's a sonic autist.
How to find a fuck load of weeaboos
1) go on chatango
2) ???
3) profit
4) find tweens
I'm not even joking I had to stop this vid and clean up because I got a nose bleed ;-;
Help me I have a weeaboo infestation what should i do????
So does it make me a weeaboo to own a katana?
Weeabos are sad. Look at their comments XD grow up I watched anime once when I was 13 and couldn't even watch the whole episode!
Hello, my name is Cowboy Tanaka XD
The tonight show with Jimmy Fallon is the best anime!
lmfao xD XD XD so tru‚Ä¶ -_- fucking hate weeaboos man‚Ä¶ -_-
I don't like Insert popular anime here
HEYB0$$
I can relate to Frank. People who say they speak "Mexican", and people who say Jalape√±o with a hard J need to be slapped.
9:08, although cringey, that's not a weeaboo
"i just wanted a piece of percy's ass you know"¬†

i couldn't make it to the end. I had to pause and just laugh for freakin hours
What has my life been before you filthy frank
I can confirm that through my examination of this channel it is official...

This... This is how aids started
This.....this is beautiful......AND FUCKING HILARIOUS!! I was feeling down and I'm so fucking happy that I found this video. Thanks Frank c:
fuck jews
SPECIAL ATTACK : SHARINGAN IM CRYING OMDAJANJA.
dont watch this around your parents they'll think your watching porn.
I understand m8. When people obssess over things and get really defensive when someone says one bad thing about their obsession thats uncalled for and really fucking stupid. Now i used to do that myself, but then i heard a voice in my head saying "YOURE BEING A FAGLORD" and from that day on i stopped being a complete faglord. Now i like anime too, but im not obsessed with the Japanese culture. Sure, maybe i'll try and learn some Japanese for fun or whatever and maybe i'll buy a couple anime related things. But thats it. Also this Frank guy is fucking hilarious.
All the weeaboos disliked this video :P lol
where are the subtitles?
DO ONE ABOUT "GAMERS" plz... I beg of you papa Franku
I didn't know that he was Japanese tooüééüééüéé
WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST SAY ABOUT SAO BREATHING INTENSIFIES

"my waifu is coming to life"

fucking died here
lolol 1m n0t a w33aboo has anime profile picture and has an anime username that translates to "i eat shit".
I actually really want to learn Japanese. Mainly because it just sounds really cool and you can confuse people while writing, and also so I can yell at people in super fast random Japanese phrases.
2:55 Don't let your dreams be dreams. Yesterday, you said tomorrow, so JUST DO IT.
This issue is quite....
Wide spread
Is it a virus?

Lol was he actually the one talking in Jap at the beginning or was he lipsing it? Because if so(Even though he totally didn't say whats in the subtitles) he totally sounds like an anime dubber lol.
9:58 PBG? oh no
There was a Hulu ad before this video started advertising Seinfeld. Anime a on Hulu now?

i feel like it's wrong to say the bit of Japanese in the beginning was hot.
Stop watching your damn Chinese cartoons, grow up and get a life. Post hate comments below.>\\\<
The only things I can say in Japanese are "Hello, goodbye, thank you, your welcome, 1-100," and "stop it". I also really like Sword Art Online. But I'm not a weeaboo, right?
Mad weeaboos be like "I'll caps lock you so hard you'll die"
Thank you. I just like watching anime and reading manga, but these weeaboos have to make me feel like the kind of nerd that's not even smart.
Marry me

I'd learn Japanese just as a hobby. Or German. What's more difficult?
Wow look at the profile pics of all these weeb kids in these comments. It's like everyone here watches japtoons.
everything you said is so true and so funny xDDDDDD
Where are the subtitles hahaha xD
wtf..... how did I get here again?
I know their are decorative swords, but shit from anime is kind of stupid
DONT YOU DARE GO NEAR FUCKING WEEABOOS!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE MASTERRACE
Hm. Wonder what social group disliked this video.
Once at the end of the school year, a weeaboo guy in my class was doing a speech and he thanked all his favorite anime characters and he also recongnized me for "getting him into manga and anime" and I couldn't show my face again to anyone there
You should be a voice actor.
Somebody talks shit to me for making fun of anime, just pop this video link and watch the gate flow in
weeabos and otakus are horrible trash. However if you live in a european country you might have come across reverse weeaboos. (japaneese people obsessing over your culture), which is also very akward.
1.699 weeaboos are breathing heavily while slamming the dislike button.
kwkw
"I'm a fucking hustler" ;3
When a weeaboo starts pretending to be Japanese just say "haiden gara gara gara" and when they say "what? " give them the middle finger and walk away
Not sure if being Filthy, or being Frank..
Why not both?
Hahahaha
I'm drunk an IO agree whetever thid oxyclean duide is sayinhfs
Frank u r the most random youtuber thats SOOOO HILARIOUS üòÇüòÇüòÇ keep up the good work!!!!!
The weeaboo song is the only thing that lets me poop other than high-potency cow laxitives.
No more filthy frank :(
Man oh man been waiting so long for the animated version of the fight at 7:20, must admit manga version looks better, and yes ofc I saw the fight in the manga beforehand OMG, lol I can already see the horrible dubbed version of it, SUB RULES!
Also Weeaboo Jones' death got me so hard that I dropped my waifu pillow, definitely was the best villain in the whole anime, only good character left is Pink Guy.
Took the words right out of my mouth. Weeaboos are as cancerous as white people screaming the N word...
Make fun of furries
Yo, would love to hear you talk about Bronies/Cloppers. Seriously man they put the filth in Filthy Frank.
Being half japanese this shit is the funniest thing I've seen in a very long time XD
this guy has problems
1,698 weaboo faggots saw this video
Attack on titan is a good show
OH MY GOD I M JGNUI(BGFUIAOJFOARHOF ¬†WEEABOO FAGIT ¬†LEAVE M E ALON IM LOVE ¬†ME ALIVE MIONECRAFT AND HENTAI
I watch anime sometimes, but eh this was funny as shit.
looks down at comments ¬†Fight Fight Fight!
This video reminded me of the time that my high school got Japanese exchange students. How they were invited to the anime club was really cringy, though I'm sure the exchange students¬†were stoked when they found out that my friend (who wasn't in the club) actually knew Japanese.¬†

I'm sure they were talking shit about those weaboos the whole time they were there.
FUCK PEOPLE WITH ANIME PROFILE PICS!
That Attack on Shittan moment was spot on
can Cowboy Tanaka be a new filthy frank character?
9:22 Did he pay them all to stand there with him?
Breathes really heavy and types really fast Wait, shit. I don't even watch Anime.
anime is trash
Not funny, annoying voice, jokes for 10 year old immature kids.
Frank u inspire me to achieve weaboo genocide
You did NOT say "are you ready to have some fun, I am", you said something else :( I'm scared.
My favourite anime are The Lion King, Kung Fu Panda and Courage the Cowardly Dog
Cory in the House is fine anime young sir.
Áô∫Èü≥„ÅÜ„Åæ„ÅÑw
XD
maaan i cant even watch your videos fully. you crack me the fuck up.
Q
I'm offensive and find this weeaboo
I watch anime on occasion. I also enjoy to partake in a bit of My Little Pony. I use a MLP avatar because I enjoy talking to other bronies. My life isn't obsessed with either of them, I just enjoy them every now and again. I'm okay with people disliking these things. However some people insult me and other people without doing research or they have a very narrow view. These people are bigots, dicks and 90% of the time trolls.
Because I like anime and MLP I don't really have a problem with weeaboos. However I do find it kinda creepy when they fap over body pillows 'n' do other creepy shit, but really, it's just them.* If it doesn't effect my life then they can do what they want.*
That's the thing people really need to start realizing. People will go out of their way to insult and abuse people that have done nothing to them, simply because they like different things. People like these shows as people like sports. Some fans will collect shirts, balls and other things from their favorite sport. Fans of these shows are like that, but more weird because it's such a controversial topic.
I think I've said my fill.
:)
At the end of the school year we had to share our greatest achievement for that year, and one of our classmates said 'becoming an otaku'. This makes me lose a bit of faith in humanity
Shinji kagawas jersery? Heheh
ROFL!!!!!!
Oh shit im fucking lost man.
what. the. fuck. am. i. watching?
I'm a racist and I find this weeaboo. Mwah XX - Cancer
8:57 That guy WILL masturbate everyday on that bed if he keeps those sheets and watches hentai...
i could not finish cause ur scratchy voice was like ... making me cringe. i get what u mean though, and agree with what ur saying, my ears just have a hard time with agreeing with the sounds your making to say them lol.
Cory in the House is my favorite anime.
Making this about myself, I and some other americans went on a trip to Japan a few years ago, and the most of us were normal people, I became more interested in the entertainment part of Japan as a result, but going in I didn't care about anime. Liking certain shows and things made it easier to make friends, but no one went because of the comics or cartoons. We went because we were chosen to represent our country and were we came from to build a bridge with the cities and areas of Japan that have been effected by the 3/11 earthquake tsunami that happened so long ago in 2011.

The trip touched a lot of our lives and for sure made me a better person, but now more than ever a bunch of weeb shits get on my nerves because they focus on the laziest form of entertainment when there are great books, fucked up movies, decent music, and what other shit you can find there. I will never forget my trip and the things that happened during it. I love the people I met and the times I had, but I am not them, and neither are the people who feel they should be a part of the culture. I would like to return, maybe try and teach since interaction between nations is beneficial and because I had a great time before, but I have no place there.

Sorry for my autistic rambling, I just haven't really talked about it in a while, and this is the best way to preserve the memories.
Classic video XD
Wtf where did all the rest of the videos go
I screamed at the anime voices. omg you should start a career as seiyuu lmao
looks off onto the horizon one time, I did try to change my gay af profile picture to a gayer one; a picture of myself. But the forces of Google prevented me from doing so
Well, swords and shit are still pretty cool regardless. Just as long as you're not dressing as anime characters and throwing them at people. :L
For a while i thought maybe i was a weeaboo.
Then a friend of mine started using the words "sensei" and "desu" in random conversations.
"Ahhhhh ok im fine."
I don't know if some of these people, some of the "weaboos" may have a psichological issue, some of them may be just idiots but what if they may need some help, they won't get it because people is laughing at them, telling them they are fucking idiots, I don't know I don't like to laugh at them, but whatever, people will always make fun of the "losers"
People keep calling me a weeaboo cuz of my profile pic. wtf
weeaboos=no money

furries=getting A LOT of money from-fursuits-art-clay art and more...
Yeah anime is complete trash fite me (Please don't fight me)
P much anythin that has a fandom is trash
Anime
Homestuck
Sherlock
MOTHERFUCKING SUPERWHOLOCK
MLP
Everything accept SU is trash¬†
Steven Univerce is just yes because
Queer representation
+steez shut up cancer. You're jealous lol.
Switched to porn cause it was easier to explain
Anime is shit
Ironically 90% of people in the comments for this vid have some kind of anime/cartoon avatar.
Dude just... just stop. I can't fucking breathe over here...
6:55 Hey boss.. ( replays it 50 times ) ¬†c:
Did you start this whole Cory in the House is best anime meme going around?
I agree, these people with anime avatars are just so freaking annoying.
So true! üêÜüêØ
What's worse than your average Weeaboo? A Spanish Weeaboo.
Am I the only one here satisfied with the way I am, yes, OK.
I was using chopsticks at school and was called a weeaboo... Thanks Frank.
Being a weeaboo is pretty much Japanese blackface
This is the third time I've seen this and it's still hilarious
Êó•Êú¨Ë™û‰∏äÊâã„Å†„Å≠„ÄÇ„ÅÑ„Å§„ÇÇÊ•Ω„Åó„Åø„Å´Ë¶ã„Å¶„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ
I know too many people like this smh
Seinfeld really is the ultimate slice of life anime
Thank you... finally someone who despises them.....
What if I'm not in to Japanese stuff like a weeaboo what if I'm into Russian stuff and try to be Russian and try to speak Russian what do you call those?
"I just wanted a piece of Percey's ass"
Your god damn right
Right?¬†
Like who the fuck do these faggots think they are having anime avatars.¬†
Honestly, if I ever saw one of those little bastards I'd fucking destroy them.
Get a fucking life amirite?
Disclaimer: ayy lmao
what the fuck. subbed.
i feel bad for the person filming this
1,680 weeaboos xD
Does it make me a weaboo if I buy a sword just to frame it and put it on my wall?
Everything he says in this video can relate to Rachel Dolezal, she's like a wannabe black weeaboo
Looks like a weird Markiplier


Sounds like Jerma985


Love this guy already
OMG his voice sounds like Edgar's voice from pewdiepie
Wait.. so do these "Weeaboo's" get made fun of like us bronies? or is it literally just us? XD
Only reason I would go to Japan would be for the car scene and the ladies. Twist loves him some Asian.
Omfg My stomach hurts from laughing so hard ;3;
This comment section is almost as good as the video itself. I have never seen so many butthurt weeaboos in one place in my life. ¬†Cringy hypocrites
This was my first filthy frank video I watched and for a second I thought his whole channel was in Japanese

It's 5 am and I'm dying of laughter on the floor.Oh my god.

Do Five Night's at Freddy's fans :^))
OMFG THIS IS HILARIOUS WHERE HAS THIS CHANNEL BEEN
My dad got me a katana because I like swords and I guess that makes me a weeaboo??? Lmao.
At 9:00 ¬†i swear that the pillow his head is on is a 10 year old girl.. i remember it from a series i watched once.
Dem filthy fucking weeaboos
You should watch One Piece. You won't regret it dude!
MY FAVORITE ANIME IS MONSTER HIGH, SONIC BOOM, AND MINECRAFT TUTORIALS.
ADVENTURE TIME IS SUCH AN OVERRATED ANIME, THOSE BAKAS.
my fav. anime is king of the hill
I'm still waiting for Papa Fraku to talk about Bronies & Furries.
SPONGEBOB IS THE BEST FURRY ANIME

1,674 weeaboos saw this
I'm watching this with japanese subtitles on
5 weeks guys.
Five weeks.
He got the anime talking bit ridiculously on point.
What's worse? Weeaboos or Fnaf fans?
Just out of curiosity, what the fuck is the deal with Weeaboo Jones's undergut fat? Or whatever the fuck it is?
We had the same dream frank. The same dream.
Don't catch weebola
Hey, can you please speak normal?

üåöLet the hate comments begin üåù
attack on titan sucks
the berenstain bears was the best anime
FRANKU TOO FAR MY ANIMEZ R ANGRY
Anyone knows the music song at 7:19 playing in the background, when Weeaboo Jones appear.
When he said rosata stone he sounded like crystopher walkins
Frank suck Prometheus till chin chin runs in and says stop because it is making him cringe
I'm offended.
Frank saved me from weeabooness
Frank=Jesus
Attack on Titan=Satan
"Cuz you know i get all that pussy, and it is scrump-diddly-umptious."
holy shit i died  #nyes
This applies to blackaboos too.
Some of the most funniest shit ive seen all year XD
Follow you're dreams son
Holy fucking shit,Frank is 52? I though he was like 20
This shit freaking me out. xD
even though i am sort of an anime lover i really enjoyed listening to this guys (whatup with his voice?) hes right about probably half or more of what he said so im definitely gonna keep watching his videos and his opinions....but still man that clip and the song were completely unnecessary xD still fun
how to get so much hate from weeaboos: call anime a cartoon for 10 year olds.
"My favorite animes consist of Toy Story,Cory in the House..."

                                   -FilthyFrankTV 2015
When i went in Japan last summer, i left my seat on the metro to let an old lady rest, and i suddenly became the hero of Japan.
dude filthy frank you are funny as hell man .
9:21 
JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA
It's Niagra Falls in my panties whenever I hear his deep sexy voice.
This video is my morning coffee.
mind if i ask you how you took care of the bodies? AHAHAHAHA

love your videos frank :D
Cory in the house is definitely my favorite anime
You should really get something for your throat buddy
Guys, guys. Everyone knows Shrek is a better anime than Corey in the House.
Simpsons over family guy any day
This is amazing
Lol my favorite anime is Thomas the tank engine and Miss spiders sunnypatch kids. 



Get on my level. Ur anime sucks.
Full House is the best anime
Bill Nye the Science Guy is the Best Anime.
My favourite anime is Ready Steady Cook featuring Ainsley Harriot.
Um just wondering would it count as them just liking Japanese culture and wanting to have some things that r for Japan like those swords or love  of anime and collecting little inuyasha dolls/action figures
I remember one time at school (YES, THIS IS TRUE). I wanted to pissed off my best friend for fun. We're both Anime fans- but, he watch more Anime than me, and, just... "WEEABOO" material.¬†
¬† I said "Anime is for kids and it's a cartoon." (DON'T KILL ME! I DID IT FOR FUN! I LOVE ANIME.) He almost hit me with a f*cking coloring book. Also, he hardly get angry- and, that was his first time. :D I'm a good friend.
do bronies people back me up on this franku DO BRONIES OR ILL TACKE UR BANANA BY FORCE
Next epidemic is bronies, right? Settle that faggot shit.
So fucken true
Lol Rosetta Stone sucks ass!!
They just throw you into some random shit & expect you to know what the fuck is going on.
"Over here at the FilthyFrank Show we support prejudice equality: EVERYBODY GETS SHIT!"

Weab0ss
If there is a weeaboo in a 2000 feet radius, simply follow these containment procedures...

1:Have a team of men (in anti-hazard suits) sent to the basement of said weeaboo, remove all of his anime and remove all of his Japanese weapons and products. (PS4 included)
IF one of the team members suit was cut, and starts talking about Rosseta Stone, it means the weeaboo disease will spread onto his body, simply put the man/woman in stasis and make them watch Family Guy for 12 hours straight.
2:Once everything in Japanese is removed, send a man down to the basement with American cartoons, (such as family guy) be sure the TV you use does NOT have any cable, and can only play said cartoon VCR's/DVD's.
3:Send the weeaboo to the basement. Wait atleast 24 hours, once he comes out, he should dress like a proper american man/woman. If the weeaboo comes out dressed like a complete fucking idiot, send him back in, cut off his water and food supply to help the process.

And that wraps it up. Don't be a weeaboo, stop them! Save our society today!

(RESULTS MAY VARY)
wait would kamen rider and sentai count towards being a weeaboo?its live action tv thats meant to be more of a drama and such
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
cory in the house is the BEST anime ever
1660 weeaboos on this video CONFIRMED!
Fookin' weeaboos just got DESTROYED! OOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!!
I'm glad this video exists.
Hey baus.
Anime is shit
But greedy fucks say we're weebs for having anime profile pics or backgrounds.
Rosetta Stone! lol
totally goes against his point but i got turned on by his anime voice
woah
k
Why do people like this guy again?
the sad thing is that there's 1,655 dislikes on this video
1,655 people are weeaboos
Resangan up the ass...
at the beginning did he just say want to have some fun in my¬†closet??
7:20 lol this is the best part
frank speaking jap looks like an anime character
My friend was a weeabo so i bought him a hatsune miku figure and than i set it on fire. That's what he gets for being a little fag lmao
FUCKING WEEABOO
I love anime honestly and I do listen to Japanese music ((<- makes me look like a fag)) but I've never wanted to be Japanese and hate myself cause I'm Mexican like shit Mexican food is good af, also I want to go to Japan... But that's cause holy shit Japanese guys and girls are hot ((jk)) but really I want to go it just seems like a cool place. Y'know?
53/2
There is one of my friend who was born as Japanese and yet speak English as first lanuage, watch anime, learns the Japanese by it, and yet is struggling. Is that a weeaboo ?
10:20
Maki no!!!
D;
I don't even know how I got here.
But im glad I did.
Seinfeld is the greatest anime. Screw Bebop, FMA, And Cory in the House.

(On a serious note, Seinfeld is actually one of the greatest American TV shows of all time.)
I love you.
This was my first filthy frank video.
Another annoying type is the Minecraft addicts. It's so annoying when you have a 5 year old with their profile pic as their Minecraft character and suggest that every youtuber does something Minecraft related, then rages in all caps when someone doesn't like Minecraft.
Wow, filthyfrank said: "just because you dress and act like a certain ethnic group, doesn't mean you're that ethnic group!"
Reminds me of a certain white woman that claims to be black...
Papa Franku, plz gib us a video on Bronies pl0x!
lol fuck weeaboos amirite
Didn't know that people collect katanas wow ¬†if there really are so many and so strange weeaboos im scared.I havent met one irl i think but still damn i prefer to staying just a casual anime fan.
I started collecting swords before I started watching anime. Your argument is invalid.
I am obssesed with ISIS
ALLAHU AKBAR!!
I'LL BEHEAD ALL ANIME FAGS! ITS AGAINST ISIS RULES!!
P.S Bush did 9/11
1,652 weeaboo faggots disliked this amazing video.
Soo .-. Im not a weaboo then...
pewdiepie is so copying filthy frank's voice
4:15 Umm... Yup, definitely heard that exact conversation before. Maybe even multiple times... Geez, anime recycles material a lot.
WHY IS THEIR HAIR ALWAYS GODDAMN PURPLE?! Do the think purple is the only hair colour that exists anime. Weebs are not only disgusting, they are are fucking dumb.
A WEEABOO HAS BEEN CRUSHING ON ME ALL YEAR JESUS CHRIST HELP MEEEE
Turn on the subtitles and go to 1:02.
ALLAHUAKBAR WEEABOOS
I dated a japanese foreign exchange student. Trust me, it's like dating your mom.
<3 frank
Why does frank have anime eyes?
His eyes have no color, its like they are just big ass pupils...
The FilthyFrank show is the best anime ever!
GRAWWWWWWW i shit on you every when im constipated
The fact people DEFEND weeaboos is fucking dreadful.
This guy is my senpai  now. All you bakas who don't like him can go find some other kawaii guy to love. I want him to aishite
4:50

true
Weeaboos go to Japan and be like: "Wh...Whe...Where are the subtitles?"
Best joke ever xD
What the fuck did I just watch?
The photos of people that were cosplaying pokemon- there is no prove that they were weeabos and the guy with the room dekoraded with figuers of anime charters- there was no prove he was a weeabo he was just an otaku !! And the guy with katanas- he may just think that the swords look cool and buy them for fun! Don't jurge people you don't new anything about!!!
lol
4:16
hueheueh
Is this supposed to be funny? Kill yourself.
Hey frank what the fuck are you, I could have sworn you were some American white guy. Are Asian? I don't see it. (Not because you don't have softball sized eyes or anything. Because you look like so many Americans I know)
rosetta stone!
this shit ain't funny
Not going to lie... I have glansed and your show before and just thought, what in the actual fuck....

But i saw the 2 haters comments epps and this weeaboos one now..... you have a new Subscriber. I need this
Make fun of Minecraft!
Weeaboos 

Weeaboos everywhere 


Oh Wait.... im wearing my waifu as a profile picture.. well that's gonna be a problem ._. 

I don't even watch anime for weeks.
Ah Joji, doesn't doing the filthy frank voice hurt your throat?
Anime is fur gays
I love anime and want to go to japan but only for the clothing stores like bathing ape and supreme :-(
The pictures of the weeaboos gave me cancer
thomas the tank engine is obviously the superior anime
9:29 also I found something "me and my girlfriend" incorrect grammar usage right there ,correct term is "my girlfriend and I"
Who knew me and Franku had so much in common? We watch the same animu!!!
What the actual duck did I just watch? Lmao I almost gave up halfway through, glad I stuck around
What is Chris-Chan doing in 10:08 ?

Franku, b0ss, don't you know who Chris-Chan is?
He is this man child; living in his mom's basement. Chris-Chan is NOT Weeaboo, by the way.
I CANT STOP LAUGHING WTF
I grew up with japanese food all of my life. I was taught japanese stuff from a very young age.

When I encountered weeaboos, and I told them instant miso wasn't miso and that Ramune was pronounced Damune, they flipped the fuck out and said I knew NOTHING about Japan and went on berating me and surrounded me like a fucking cult.

Bitch, can you even make miso, do you even know why the Samurai carried two swords, do you even know who the director Akira Kurosawa was? Life isn't all about anime and rice, people.

Thank you.

Subscribed.

PS: There was a japanese show where they went to a weebs house and verbally abused him because he was a fat sack of shit who loved anime.
help me all my friends a
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
I used to find you annoying as fuck, but now I'm starting to really like your vids. This was fucking hilarious
I used to be a weeaboo for a while.
Thank god I moved on from that.
I still like to listen to a good Vocaloid song every now and then and might watch some Guilty Crown maybe.
I might even read my Pokemon manga sometime!
But, i`m not a weeaboo anymore.
but my friend is and ohmygod
I'm a weaboo, but I'm not as insane as you say
ANIME IS FOR FAGGOTS
I've had Japan all wrong I thought they were all ninjas with giant katanas
9:56
That. Guy. Is . A. BADASS
wow you really are against them... Well it really made the video funny :D
This is great. I do watch anime regularly but there's the people (weeaboos) who are try hards at it :P and ruin the anime community.
attack on titan is my favorite western cartoon
frank, please just kill yourself already, it's the only way to end the pain that is your faggot fanbase
+TVFilthyFrank I wonder how many weeaboos re thought there life after this video HAHAHA! OH BOY! A million anime figurines were thrown away when this was uploaded FUCK YOU WEEABOO GARBAGE! 1K DISLIKES ARE ALL WEEABOOS!

ACCURATE FUCKING ANIME IMPERSONATION
I find it so ironic that a lot of Filthy Frank's subscribers are Weaboos.
It's funny because half of your fanbase are these people.
I love you
Lol, "Borderline pedophile".
What if I told you, there's people in Japan that are seriously into white culture and shit, its the same feeling over here
I know Hiragana and half Katakana and I'm not a weeb
CHUG FASTER PERCY
Fresh Prince of Bel Air and ICarly are better than Cory in the House
I enjoy anime but there's a fucking limit that I don't think weeaboos see
parks and rec is my favorite anime
The only thing worse than weeaboos are bronies. Hey, FilthyFrank, make a video about bronies.
i just wanted a piece of percys ass ya feel me
I'm not really lazy at all and I am very clean/sterilized. I also take my education very seriously, I have never gotten anything below a B. But, I own a lot of anime merchandise, like an Attack on Titan jacket, A DeathNote, an L necklace over 13 manga books, many Otaku magnifies, Hetalia bracelets, and etc. Well, is that considered being a 'Weaboo'?
Omg true I love anime A LOT but what you showed is like unhealthy and stuff like ew
So all the anime people I've encountered are hypocrites.¬†
"Stop posting ponies everywehre!!!1112222" xD

I can't fucking breathe üòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ omfg Cory in the house XDDD
"I just wanted a piece of that helicopters ass you feel me..."...."Dreams don't come true..."
O mah haw that guy was licking the crap out of that poor pillow weaboo are meat up but I didn't know it could get this worse 0.0
Omfg that guy gunna drape that katana straight up his but
I hear they come from 4chan
52 year old?
OH MY FUCKING GOD I CANT STOP LAUGHING XD




Now I do like anime and I do like yaoi/yuri but weaboos? Nah man. Anime is too trash for them they need to leave stop




Also anime girls with big ass eyes aren't cute or adorable. I prefer anime women with big, but not too big (Like Haruka Seragaki from DMMd. She has perfect anime eyes like wow gimme).






One more thing, Lolicon and Shotacon are not cool. No...
I don't know why this video made me laugh so hard
Its so fucking stupid
I hate anime
am I a weeaboo if I watch a couple animes and have some knives and throwing stars?
kinda scary how this is frank's most viewed video
Goddam filthy weeaboos with their anime Characters as their profile pics
the rasengan hahahahahahahahahah
Holy shit this is great.
anime is gay
This just shows us that Japs are crazy in any part of the world. #turnup
You're an asshole. Filthy describes you perfectly.
this showed up in the music section of my youtube
Hey. My friend came to my house today and showed me this video, and I have to say, I'd enjoy it a lot more if I didn't feel like my throat was bleeding in commiseration.
6:57
"Hayy ba0wss."
I just want to learn how to read Japanese characters so I can play more PC98 visual novels.
This is some next level shit.
Where are the subtitles? Best line ever. XD
This guy speaks the fucking truth lmfao
Corey in the house is Dank.
"Herro, my namu izu cowboy tanaka."
I love anime, cause its just awesome.but have never spent a penny on that cause why would I.Also I don't see why the Flying fuck people feel that if someome says something bad about anime they feel like they have to make him like it. So the fuck what if others don't like anime,all that matters Is u enjoy it
Where the videos @
I love how sometimes, what he's saying in Japanese doesn't match with the subs. But it got weird right off the start.
havent watched anime for months now, watch them now and then if i felt like it, but ¬†i know people who watch everyday for 10 hours straight and cant stop talking about it and then they start talking about their sexual fantasies, like...  the girl are not even FUCKING REAL. really pisses me off
eyy b0ss
laughing my fucking ass of, ay conchetumadre brother!
You're pretty much the greatest thing to happen to the internet.
Oh my god this man goes out in public...
Rosetta stone is da best! So shut da fuck up talking shit about good anime!
So true
What does having an anime avatar have to with being a weaboo? I personally find certain pictures/gifs iconic. This can be true for anything really. Liking anime =/= weeaboo, weeaboo is something else. I'd say someone who wears a japanese sailor uniform, tries to speak japanese or uses japanese phrases/words in the middle of a sentence, buys japanese weapons and uses them to pose with, or reading manga and complaining about anime adaptations or just the use of dubs in general are great examples of weeabooism. That aside, this video was very entertaining and did make me lol.
7:46 LMAO :v
My favourite anime is full metal jacket
This video is fucking crazy. I love it.
My throat hurts just listening to you.
So, uh...
Is it possible to have learned Japanese through a tutor or any other such medium, have taken holidays to Japan to places you like,¬†like Japanese food, have an interest in their culture and not be a weeaboo if you're lucid and aware that you're not Japanese? Does 'weeaboo' basically entail someone who has convinced themself they're Japanese and shits on everyone else? I think I've got it...
I'm a fan of evangelion and that's about it. I've tried getting into other anime but whatever. My other favorite anime is Star Wars and Saving Private Ryan.
preach
filthy basically saved me from turning into a full blown weaboo.
if it werent for him then i wouldve been a loser
loooooooooooooooooool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
All the dislikes are some pissed off weebs
Scrumpt Diddily umpshus
Filthy frank be hatin' on weeaboos when he be sippin' on dat Arizona GREEN TEA. That shit's got a geisha on the damn can. c'mon now.
HOW DARE U MAKE FUN OF ANIME JUST BECUASE I WAS BORN IN TEXAS DOSENT MEAN IM NOT JAPANESE!!!!!!111!!!!!ONE!!!
Any of you losers know the sad song that was playing during his fantasy of percys ass
Wait, I'm sort of confused. 
I like drawing in the manga/anime style, and I like anime, but as long as I'm not trying to actually BE Japanese I'm not a weeaboo, correct?
King of the hill is the best anime
I never realized how beautiful his legs where until now. LOOK AT THEM. There so skinny and long. THEY. ARE. SO. FUCKING. BEAUTIFULLLLL
1K WEEABOOS don't like this video.
Is he japanse?
when he is describing the typical weaboo living areas, the subtitles decided attic should be ball sack, now i have weaboos in my testicles
Fuck you weeaboo jones I love family guy! 

Reality Check Reality Check
I'll tell you all something sad. I was in class and there was these two weeaboos checking on anime guys... They were moaning how sexy they were... #fuckweeaboos
Hahaha his real personality is freaking different xD 

Best show on the internet i love you b0ss !! Please gibe the possi !!
anime fucking rocks stay the fuck away I love this channel but stay the fuck away from anime I will kill you with my kunae ha ha just kiding weaboos are fucking digusting
Pleaaasee go back to making vids like this. I miss the vintage franku.
Hey he likes shinji kagawa
Holy shit. I don't know how I ended up here, and I wish I never did. This video is disturbing. Verily. KEEP MAKING SHIT LIKE THIS!
press 3 for heavy breathing
I ONLY LIKE ONE PIECE I'M SORRY
i like ur eyes based weaboo
fun fact: guy seen at 9:50 was actually arrested for pedophilia.
For every one Weeaboo there are 2 million Asian Westyboo's.¬†

It's funny as hell that a country that oozes malcontent for it's own culture, lifestyle and image, can stereotype and degrade a handful of people doing the exact same thing lol.
4:09
what's wrong with rosetta stone
freaking weaboos now days =c b0ss i ned halp
Cory in the house is a pretty awesome anime I agree 100% its wayy better than attack on titan
I get mad waifu pussy.
Filthy Frank fucked my bitch and I am thankful.
HA!i bet you weaboos can speak more harder Japanese words just like filthy frank!
FilthyFrank should totally do a skit called "The Weeabo Father" since he does an awesome unintentional don corleone impersonation. XP
VAD HAR DU I BYXORNA? XddddddddddddddddDDD :PPPPPPPPp |:^)
I'm one of those tumblr blogs who has an anime avatar but stays 100% American in reality. I know better not to shout out random Japanese in a cutesy cartoonish voice.
two kinds of people in this world
weeabos and bronies. wish one is worse?
Well what if you buy Japanese weapons and CAN use them ?
1:07 THANK YOU. SLAMS TABLE
I sent this to almost everyone I know who watches anime. They all got a little heated as I forced it down their throats.
The girl at 9:46 could be so fucking hot if she wasn't so god damned fat.
I'm 18 I enjoy anime kon as much as the next and I'm completely normal so please not everyone is fucking crazy ok please I'm being nice not everyone do that yeah I dress up but as asuna yuki
Where can I get that picture of Maki at 10:20?

Who the fuck is Roseta Stone?
I'm part of a cult where we shun and destroy weeaboos.
Friends is my favourite anime
+TVFilthyFrank¬†In chromosomes, how old are you?
Okay I believe he said :
There are two hypertrophy people in my closet.
They're both dead.

LOL
The fucken weebs will sit on you watch out.
3:27 You sure showed me. ehu ehu EHU EHU
your deep voice sounds sexy as fuck mmmmm me gusta
I hate anime, but I love hentai.
Which is worse? a weeaboo or a brony?
This is so sugoiii! desu NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE









not sorry.
What the hell r u talking about?
If I paint my face black am I black?
I never thought weeaboos would affect this much on anime fandom.
I hate weeaboos and their gratuitous japanese, they are so annoying.
....LOL some people will not believe me because my profile pic is a manga character.
Ummm no thanks frank
Chris-chan is many things, but weeaboo is probably not one of them.
Okay this was okay in a point of view.
ey b0ss can i habe the violin song playing at 07:20 pls c:
I find it really funny that most of franks fans are weeaboos
My family and i are moving to japan Stepdad is military and my friends are all weebs and im not so theyre mad and im just like well
i love u franku
If you are a butt hurt weeaboo and think that commenting in caps lock will help, just remember the golden rule of commenting: DON'T! That stands for Doooooooooooon't. That way you won't embarass yourself more than you already have.
Hands down the best anime is no doubt King of the hill
Can I like a show and not be a part of its fandom? Cause i thought the first 4 seasons of supernatural were decent :/
Let's plot a Course! Intercourse!
Learned how to speak Japanese from filthy frank.
2:30 Someone needs to tell Rachael Dolezal that...
Doesn't that hurt his throat?
Man, I cringed so incredibly hard at those pics. Adult dudes sleeping with/photoshopping their anime gf's next to them... My fuck...
plays recorder with nose
im sorry this is the first time i watch Filthy Frank, one  question? whats up with his voice?
Guys I'm new to anime which series would you consider for me to watch first? Cory in the House or Seinfield. Please respond :^)
Is it just me or does his Japanese "voice" sounds like... Wow
0:10 he has white people in his closet 100/ 10
Nobody can learn Japanese through watching anime. I watch anime and hentai, but I will not start trying to be something that I'm not. Please.
Ouch.
this guys voice box must kill
XD omg I love that white person joke
He talks like pewdiepies dog edgar ¬†:D
I like to collect weapons (WW2)
And this was when Filthy Frank the Anime Hunter was born.
If you actually sound like this I don't know why you bash everyone else on the internet lol
+Thomas the Dank Engine
I wonder if someone in Japan made a video like this but about Japanese people obsessed with western culture.
worse than a weeaboo is a weeajew
i feel like weebs break a sweat just typing
this helped me stop my weeaboo ways
Look at my google profile I'm not a weeaboo I don't watch anime or try the speak it I saw attack on Titan once and I put this as my picture please understand
Stop Making Videos And start Making Fuckup Music :P
Nah Bro Ur So Funny And Fuckup At the same time but m8 Make a new voice
This is the only video i actually respected you...
Damn Japanophiles...
I want to agree with you, but like I also want my profile pic to be Jiraiya so yeah...
8:52 and 9:25...why is this real?
Did frank just say he's 52?
Oh my gosh, Chris-Chan came in on 10:08.
To all the people with katana collections I think my shotgun would win just saying or actually a real sword just sayin
My favorite anime is the real world
that fight scene near 8:00 tho
THIS. IS. AMAZING.
Weaboos make me cringe with shame when I slink through the manga/anime section of the comic book store.
HEAVY BREATHING
98% of these comments are all weeaboos
I like¬†the Chinese cartoons too
Fuckin nerds with their anime avatars.
Helicopter had the best ass.
Venus Angelic is the biggest weeaboo ever. She annoys me so much:(
I am a Weeaboo my favorite animes are sanic spongebob and the incredebles
My favorite anime is definitely the backyardigans¬†
I also read the backyardigans manga
This is probably one of the edgiest videos he's ever made, so much in fact that he's too scared to make fun of anyone else
I watch hentai for the plot.
Manga avy reporting in.
lol i remember going stumbling on facebook page wheres these anime freaks compared people who think hate anime to who think doing drugs is cool or just comparing them to drug addicts
Filthy frank is my spirit animal
FILTHY FRANK STARTING IN BOKU NO PICOPICO LIVE ACTION FILM
filthy frank you're a genius and don't let anyone tell you different
Is filty frank really 52?
LMAO THIS GUYS KILLIN IT
Sometimes I like to rub my balls and then sniff my hand
7:04 to 7:06
Somebody give me the pussy pls?
XD
To be Frank, I thought this video was hilarious!
Your voice sounds like crack.
This video will show you how to get Pussi. Right b0ss?
Naruto is so gay
The Brady Bunch is my all time favorite anime
weaboos = the cause of cancer and world starvation
Papa Franku clearly shows us that one can still like anime but not be called a weeaboo.
0:48
Why does this fan base have it wrong by calling people weeaboos when they are not? It's like a witch hunt. Ignorant and presumptuous.
Spongebob is my favorite anime.
What anime is that, from the picture? 01:17
was this the video that started the "ey boss" ?
I have a friend who is legitimately Japanese and gets called a weeaboo all over the Internet.
Dance lah
...








Wanna see my katana collection?
As a mod of /r/Anime and /r/Otaku you filthy baka guy genes need to stop making fun of anime. We are kind people. I will be attending a anime and bronycon fest in the later future. I am the cool guy with the fedora and I will be tipping it to lure my waifus into a sense of false security and then I will bring her into my basement and when the time is right I will show her my Anime collection. Now I will leave a dislike because you are a hater of your superior senpai culture ^^ ~
thank you
I hate anime. Post hate comment below.
You went to far frank. we're coming for you.
What's wrong with Rosetta stone?¬† Is that a bad tool for learning Japanese? legitimately curious.¬† Hope I didn't just waste money on that.¬† ;_;
Filthy frank, I would actually die of laughter if you would just take 3 minute of your life to look at a YouTube account called "maddy B".

It is the most cringiest thing I've ever seen, and the worst part of it is that he is serious about his account
Would only buy a katana to eith go on a massacre or play fruit ninja...
I lost it when he said, "Nobody practices Jutsus in the corner" lmao
Cory in the house is my favorite anime
Jesus fucking Christ. Ever single person who comments has either an anime picture or a MLP picture.
Joke's on you, all 57 of my swords that I used my college tuition debt on are CHINESE!

HAHAHAHA!!
Cowboy tanaka.
THAT YAMETEEEE PART IS FUNNY AS HELL!!!!!
You have done well, Frank.
Now, a massive request requires you to shame insignificant lifeforms known as 'Bronies'.
fuck you.....But I have to say you nailed the Japanese talking style well, I really thought you were Japanese..
Otakus the same as weaboos?
1:17 What anime/game?
Sesame over attack * fuck me trying to be funny and shit
U guys dont even know anime ok. Sesame street attack on titan any day u dont even know good anime
Is being Filthy Frank called weeboo? :c
but umm i just found this random pic on the interwebs and i like it
This is the definition of perfect.
Where is he from?
King of the hill is best anime you faggets
I am a weeabu o.O I should not have watched this XD lol no I am not going to get defensive or push anyone else away haha I respect everyone no matter what üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç‚òùüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüíìnot cool man not cool
I bet your neighbors think you escaped a mental institution.
Everyone in the comments has anime profile pics I'm fucking disgusted
Where is the hyenas
I just laughed my ass off when I saw this 4:10
I frickin' lost it when he said ''My name is cowboy Tanaka'' with a Japanese accent...
TO PEOPLE WHO KEEP TRYING TO PUSH AWAY PEOPLE CALLING THEMSELVES "OTAKU":

A. Many people who call themselves otaku are aware of the true meaning in Japan.
B. WORDS CAN CHANGE MEANING BASED ON CULTURE. Try saying you want to "bum a fag" in the UK (borrow a cigarette) versus the US (uh...you know).
C. It's none of your bloody business if an innocent person wants to call themselves something. Now go away. Otaku and proud!

(also if you want to reply with some stupid tumblr-style sarcastic quip please drink bleach)
whats the anime at 1:18
//screams
AoT Tho.
Poor saskee now he is in jail. Maybe the boys there think he is hot too. Prepare your asshole seeskee a wet dick waiting for you in the Shower ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Don't worry Frank, you can always be Thomas the Dank Engine.
I know some shit who behaves like this. He wants to learn Japan to be "cool" and to talk shit to his parents in Japanese. I have to go camping with this fat fucking weeaboo. If I get the chance, he's getting pushed off a cliff. I will notify you if the weeaboo purge begins.
Gotta say im a fan of that King of the Hill anime
I disagree! Few animes pale in comparison to iCarly!
Weeaboos and bronies behave the same. When you shit on them they make an excuse when they know they made a huge mistake in life
Not everyone who is a fan of anime is a weeaboo, there's otakus to!
6:57
Nae nae is the best anime dance that i learned
Weeaboos why do they get arrested that's just sad. I watch anime but I don't freaking think I'm japanese. I just like anime.
i watch attack on titan, naruto, dragon ball z, full metal alchemist, cowboy bebop, kill la kill, gundam, pokemon, digimon, avatar, azumanga dioh, bakugan and black lagoon
I have a chio chan costume and great ape pajamas
and I learned Japanese on google translate
but im still not a weeaboo*







*just psycho
God people with anime avatars are such fagots.





( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Weeaboo Jones is the best boss fight ever. Shadow of The Colossus should bow to this.
What the desu did you just fucking desu about me, you little desu? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my desu in the Navy Desus, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret desus on Al-Desu, and I have over 300 confirmed desus. I am trained in desu warfare and I‚Äôm the top desu in the entire US armed desu. You are nothing to me but just another desu. I will desu you the fuck out with desu the likes of which has never been seen before on this desu, mark my fucking desu. You think you can get away with saying that desu to me over the desu? Think again, desu. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of desu across the USA and your desu is being traced right now so you better prepare for the spam, maggot. The spam that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your desu. You‚Äôre fucking desu, kid. I can be desu, desu, and I can desu you in over desu ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare desu. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed desu, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Desu and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable desu off the face of the desu, you little desu. If only you could have known what unholy desu your little ‚Äúdesu‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking desu. But you desu, you desu, and now you‚Äôre desu, you goddamn desu. I will shit desu all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking desu, kiddo.
I busted a gut during this video.
All in the Family is probably the most under appreciated anime ever.
What if Frank. If weeboos vs whoivans
sooooo many weaboos at my school, its just too sad
JUST BECAUSE YOU LIKE TO LOOK AND ACT LIKE A CERTAIN GENDER, DOESNT MEAN YOUR THAT GENDER. Thank you! It goes for both.
"Everyone gets shit"- Gandhi 1945
many people says that i'm a weaboos because i say i'm from japan. but sadly i am
I have been reading several comments and have to say, just because you watch anime doesnt mean you a weaboo nor should you be degraded for you interest. I believe God created everyone equal, and many of you may not believe in god but that should still go. What im saying is you shouldn't make fun of someone for something you may do just as bad.
My favorite anime is FilthyFrank
I don't like Sao... OH DEAR GOD NO~
Damn his real voice is kinda hot
OMG the tomas part XDXD
Made me laugh
Don't talk shit about Attack on Titan it's a really good show. lol I died.
yeah screw those fags with anime avatars!
um guys i`m scared
Put cc on and go to 1:01
I hate weeaboos. I don't conisder myself a weeaboo, I'm actually Japanese for real, well almost. I will be when I live in Japan though. Right now I'm studying japanese, japanese history and I'm following Bushido, the way of the warrior. This is why I hate weeaboos that know 5 words in japanese and use them all the time, kawaai baka DESU NE MOTHERFUCKER. I'm actually trying to become Japanese for real unlike all these faker wees. FUCK YOU WEEABOOS
So my question is, how good are my chances of becoming Japanese for real?
Fuk u
Best parts: 3:29, 5:11, 6:57
Thumbs up if you ever had that weeboo who ran to lunch like naruto.
You guys are dumbasses, Mythbusters is the best anime.
Why does the weeaboo have a bulb ?
Oh shit! I have a friend who have all these cool sword collections........GASP!!!!! Oh no......better warn him quick. Wait................................I almost bought shurikens!!!!! (Oh shit oh shit oh shit)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¬†

Throws EVERYTHING!!!! BURN BURN BURRRRN!!!
What have I done with my life???!!!
10:08 the fuck is up with this chest?
I LOVE YOU
4:10 ahahahaha

Don't dis people who have anime in their profile pics. I just so happen to be a big fan of Blue's Clues (AKA my favorite anime), so I think I should show everybody that I jerk off to pictures of Steve every other fortnight. Good day and happy katana collecting.
"Airplane instruction videos from the 80s"  was a truly underrated gem of an anime.  Much better than the overrated Cory in the House
English translation-I will enjoy killing you slowly
Ÿàÿ≥ŸàŸÅ Ÿäÿ™ŸÖÿ™ÿπ ÿ®ÿ®ÿ∑ÿ° ŸÇÿ™ŸÑ ŸÑŸÉŸÖ
1571 weeaboos watched this
Did he say "shit mom"
The weeaboo pictures just make me feel bad for them it's just like I pity them I don't know how to explain it but it's just really sad seeing how much of a loser they are. I like anime and manga and that's it. I don't speak japanese nor follow their culture. I don't buy other things that relates to anime or Japanese stuff. I play a rhythm game that has Japanese music in it but it's multicultural so yeah.
FUCK JAPANESE ANIME!
starts breathing heavy and typing on the computer LMFAO!!!! that is so true, like if you tlk shit about aot i will fuck you up, lol...... it's a problem.....
I wish more of his videos where like this.
1:04 Voice crack XD
What...WHAT IS THAT SONG AT 7:14....I MUST KNOW!!!
You have the most annoying fucking voice ever.. Sounds like you have a piece of dick stuck in your throat.. Just as bad as a faggot weeaboo
4:40 was pure gold hahah!
Press 7 for crazy action.
I wona have kids from u <3 and yes i am male :3 an not gay ... so ... there are many ways an this m8 get complicated ... but i really do :S xD
4:10 i'm fucking crying man xD
Hi Frank. I found you when I watched max moefoe's child birth sacrifice and I clicked on the link to your channel. I love max so I figured I would love you too. If max says a channel is good I go check it out. Just found you today and subbed. I love your videos. See you soon.
My favorite anime is Shake It Up
Fucking weeaboos man.
But I like the anime words ;-; I love to use -Kun and -Chan and -Senpai after my friends names D: That's mostly all I do, I also say baka and shtuff but I never disrespect japanese culture, I just love the words, I never act like I'm japanese either xD
Do a video on the disgusting fandom of FNAF

I love how beautiful and disturbing this is at the same time.

Cory in the House, best anime.
6:56 ey b0ss
BTW make ur videos downloadable in offline mode on YouTube android so I can share more of ur awesomeness
Lmao the comment section is filled with anime profile pics XD
Bro I'm here for encouragement. I like ur stuff it's true and straight to the point its the best work plus it's OK if u call urself sad cuz ur doing and saying good things in life OK? OK ur the best (y)
please stfu ty from everyone without a nasaly face fucking life fuck you
I dunno about you guys, but Cory In The House is my favourite anime.
Cory in the house is just a lame Disney channel show. I've watched quite a bit of it and boy does it suck. I have seen much better shows than Cory in the house. And since I'm expecting people to call me a weeaboo, f*** off. I'm just a average anime fan that loves shooting guns and loves living in the USA.
The rasengan bit got me.
So into anime. Can't get enough of that zach and Cody
Wtf
make a video about cloppers
Rather be a Weabo than this guy
befOooore
Frank you don't have the balls to make a Bronies video.
6:55 - 7:06 Best Part of the video
Haro, my namu isu Cowboy Tanaka
Your autism fulfills my pleasure
Lol
Glad you get all d cat
at 10:10 is he flexing?
I lost faith in humanity a long time ago and i just want human kind to vanish from existence
dan and phil
This voice... This voice is...
I watch hentai
It was funny until you said faggot, to be honest.¬†

Call me butthurt, but it's getting old.
dirty asians
Except 90% of the viewers are weeaboos
I almost became a weaboo once, the only things I was missing were thinking I was Japanese, the katana collection (too young at the time), learning Japanese from anime, and being a self-righteous dick. But then again, I was only 10 at the time. Must be a phase. Thanks Franku and good luck with Lord Chin Chin!
I just wanted a piece of Percee's ass you feel me , I died lol.
Wait! So it's now a bad thing to have an anime picture as a profile pic? Well then I'm fucked...
Weeaboos are people too
Frank I've find a weeaboos type pewdiepie KAWAII ALERT
WEEABOOS ARE TOTALLY AMERICAN COSPLAYERSSS!!!!!!! xDDD
+Die O Daptor¬†YO WHERE ARE THE SUBTITLES
it got wierd at 7:50
"because it is scrum-ditily-umptious"
IS he really japanese? M8
anime = Hitler's dream
you fukin sick bastard.

From Japan with love
Fuck these anime fans.I like D Gray Man but am not gay about it.
I'm going to start learning Japanese and I occasionally watch anime- does that make me a weeaboo?


Sort of a rhetorical question, I know the answer's no (according to urbandictionary anyway). People should really stop throwing the words "weeaboo" and "kill yourself" around the second someone has something Japanese-related around them. It's like a calling a German a Nazi, or a Muslim a terrorist, or someone who got raped a pervert
ey b0ss ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
COUGH http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSeventhHokage COUGH
am i a weaboo because i own a katana but i got it before i even knew about anime and i just got it because i enjoy sharp objects
Just beacuse someone likes anime, collects anime stuff, cosplays, and wants to go to jaan doesn't make them a weeaboo ;-;
I can hear my sanity begging for mercy every time I watch one of your videos... Yet I endure for reasons unknown.
That video changed my lifeüòÇ
GET HIM REALITY GET HIM! FUCK HIM UP!
Ooh those fuken weaboos. Good thing Im not a weaboo and only own 500 mangas and 200 magical girl action figures...
WHO HELPS HIM FILM THESE VIDEOS?
My Weeaboo friend showed me this,
and I told him he's not saying what the subtitles are saying.

... \(OoO)\
There is a weeaboo in my school
Look at all of the defensive weeaboos saying they aren't weeaboos
Just imagine what his neighbors were thinking.


"Honey, he's at it again..."
"Should we call the cops this time?"
"They can't help him now... Nothing can..."
Caaannnnnn someone give me the pussy, please?
Your favorite anime is shit , oh wait? you love your favorite anime? .....itsss......shiiiiiiit

ok, so my friend's older brother keeps calling me a weeaboo, but i still keep in touch with my own culture plus i can't even speak Japanese!
Gawd Pery has a really sweet piece of hot ass xxx
they are not wrong about naruto being over rated...
Holy shit, everyone here has a FUCKING anime profile pic! Not that its a fucking bad thing....I like anime too.
cory in the house best anime confirmed........do u agree???
At 0:09 he says - "There are two Jewish people in my closet. They're both dead." ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I was expecting the weeaboo protection chamber to be a shower
The weeaboos in the song mostly has white people..... I GUESS THEY FORGOT ABOUT PEARL HARBOR
Cory for pres 2016
I had a bunch of weeb friends in high school. I never got into that stuff, never really looked into Japanese culture. Due to my job I had to visit Japan for a few days and they were all excited and super jealous. They were talking so much garbage I was expecting to walk into town and see super skinny Japanese dudes with green hair and the latest technology, transforming phones and shit. Girls in cute school uniforms all doing the V for victory sign and giggling like crazy.

Nope. It was just a regular town where everyone happened to be Japanese. I'm pretty sure I saw someone washing their clothes in a creek. Not different than when I visited Hong Kong, Thailand, Dubai or Canada.

Also I'm pretty sure I was unwelcome. I got 'X'ed a lot. Crossed arms telling me I couldn't come in to look at guitars or whatever. Oh well, I'll never go back.
You don't need to see anime to hear the dramatic talking and female moaning, I play Dead Or Alive and my language setting is set to Japanese so I see it all the time lol
xD
NOTICE ME WEEABOO JONES! NOTICE MEEE
Lmao!!
This is the first filthy Frank I've watched. 

I've found the real god.
I hate how no one ever mentions Spanish subs, English subs are so overrated
I literally made a picture between trash anime( your typical kawaii weeaboo shit) and real anime (Cory in the House) as a joke and you don't know how much of those fucking weeabs went apeshit on me on facebook.
This is classic
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) kekekekekek
Anime is complete shit
Fucking Weaboos, makes me want to commit sudoku.
When I was little, I wanted to be Thomas The Tank Engine, but that never happened did it?
Im a Frankuboo
I have the biggest weeaboo inn my class, when i say that she is noe she says, Im not a weeaboo, om an otaku and says something japanese, and everyday i har her say japanese shit and says she wants to go Japan and it pisses me off.
We all know what the tissues are for.
Thomas be like LOOK AT ASS DOH!!
Joji...Please
This guy is fucking awesome !
Scene on 9:27 was a bit of a badass
This is what happens if we let weeabos go free
https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11263943/1/Five-Night-At-Freddy-Retribution
This guy is such a good actor! This is some quality shit compared to like pewdiepie or some shit
Hey Boss!¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I have an ANIME profile pic on other social media, but learn Japanese in school. weeaboo?
No. The Walking Dead is the best anime ever made. MY opinion.
how did you survive all the katanas and shit jeez ya gurd
I watch hentai all the time to learn Japanese!
 
When i speak to a japanese people.
I always end up saying:
 
-cum.
-breasts.
- youre dick is massive.
-tentacles 
-alien's
-school uniforms

Also hentai is the reason cartoon creators are afraid to create  caracters because some fat nerd will probably jerk off to him or her.

wink, and ww2 victory fingers.
Just realized that u filmed this at your college campus. 
And still no one gave a fuck about it.
Amazing. 
Simply amazing.
I watch anime and I want to go to Japan but I'm not like what u are saying I am
plus I collect swords
MY FAVORITE ANIME IS CORY IN THE HOUSE TOO!!!!!!!!!!
Weeaboo mo√© l`bat
What's wrong with hentai profile pictures? I like em ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
"hey boss"
Lmfao. I am guess I am not as big of a weaboo as I thought I was cuz I was laughing throughout the whole video rather then raging and being offended LOOOL
I'll admit that I'm some what of a weeaboo. I do own a katana, but that's because it was a birthday gift from ex's family, who were Japanese. I do read manga, I can admit that. I love it, but I'm that obsess with anime that much where I'm tiring to speak Japanese, Photoshopping pictures with me and some anime girls in them, cosplaying as an anime character EVERYDAY, or having my entire room covered in anime posters!
This is the first video I'm watching of him and what the fuck is wrong with his voice
laughing hyena intensifies
This video is so true. XD
Yes i am an otaku. luv those mangos and animoo. i also perfected the language of japanese. ohio. koala desu. ickydickymasu. cherry blossoms are my favorite food
I'M CRYING XDDDDDüòÇüòÇüòÇ
people with anime avatars are faggots
+-TURQUOISE-¬†you
* while noting head puts gun to my head*
Great video b0ss !
4:10 Dude you should be a Japanese voice actor. That voice was badass!
Im a weaboo
lol is it wrong for me to love this and still love anime xD
Wait was that pbg?
NYEEES
1,522 people are weeaboos.
I'm just a simple otaku XD sweatdrop oh boy have i seen weaboos......... dang.....and I'm a cosplayer but i don't believe I'm japanese I'm colombian and i loooove being colombian
This reminds of The Mighty Boosh and just as funny.
This guy can be an anime voice actor.
Im glad im not the only one who wants a piece of percy's ass
You Don't Know the jojo's bizarre adventure community fucking awesome bruh
Senpai iku~~~~~ kyu~~~~
How do you kill weaboos???
ecks dee
I used to be somewhat of a weeb until I learned a bit more about Japan. I still want to learn Japanese for the fuck of it though.
Franku... we have a bigger problem... Bronies
fire vs water
evil vs good
light vs dark
reality vs anime
4:32-4:36---> All you need to know
4:33 my new text notification sound.
I want it
Dude, Frank you're the best. Literally my favorite youtuber.
I can't stop laughing at the intro hahha. Real translation: there are 2 persons in my closet. Both are dead. Hahahah
I can relate in the form of potential humor and a relaxing cup of coffee.
what is the weeaboo jones song?
The two with blue hair look Japanese
You can play recorder with your nose... I can play trumpet recorder flute and clarinet... But not with my nose
Omg pause right on 4:56 haha his face
4:38-4:56 bro hahahahahaha hehe
I still can't stop laughing at 3:28-3:30ish I'm dying
His voice cracks at 1:05-1:06 ish
Hahaha sheesh 7 months... COME OUT WITG ANOTHER VIDEO ALREADY!! I have a good idea for it... Pink guy becomes a weaboo :'(
Meth not even once
Can someone please tell me the name of the anime at 1:18 ? n_n it looks really cute and it's the kind of style I like to watch :) thanks!!
Damn that weeabo song on iTunes
Don't get me wrong, having a katana doesn't make you a weeaboo, it's the reason you bought it that does. My brother used to call me a weeaboo because I watched anime in general and wanted a sword art online t shirt, and now he's the one watching anime on a daily basis XD, THE Irony.
Let's all be honest...the biggest weaboo to ever breathe air is Venus Angelic Hands Down. Its scary how hard she trys to be Japanese.
I think his voice is so messed up cause he sucks huge dick
Anime fucking sux!
They only come in Japanese and there fucking CARTOONS for four year olds!
Just simply amazing. I wrote somthing like this on my Steam profile. Have a read folks, support the movement but put "Copyright - Made by Capo" under the text. Thank you.

Special anouncement:¬†
If you watch Anime, your dad probably raped you at the age of 2... now you're sitting there, watching Anime because you're a fucking fat fuck, shave your fucking neckbeard you fucking cunt and leave your moms basement. You pile of shit, your mom is very proud of you, no job, watching cartoons all day, shitting in a bucket because your legs are broken cause of the fat. Fucking neckbeard, go do something in your life. Stop watching Star Trek & Japanese porn, smfh, nasty fucks. I know there is a special place for you guys in hell. Fucking hentai faggots designed lolicon, fucking retards like to watch cartoon ¬†kids getting raped. You probably thinkin' damn, is that me and my dad?

This is the reason why am I in special Ed classes cause of you -.-

"Hi, I'm +H—É√∏–∫Œ±¬†and I disable replies on all my comments that only quote shit from the video because I don't want to be insulted like the weeaboo I am."
I hate when I go on the Pokemon hashtag on Instagram and see Hentai I puke
I'm a changed man.. I had no idea what the word meant... But this shit is what I see A LOT.
Is being a weaboo not daijobu?
Why Does He Always Wear The Same Shirt?
Omg this was soooo funny
School Days is one of the best anime I have ever watched.
hey b0ss
Now as disgustingly beautiful as it is, there's a few Japanese people in there. Can Japanese people be weeaboos? 
(let's not rage i'm asking a genuine question)
retard
I think no one here is on my anime expertise level.
That's so me. I'm not a weeaboo but...major otaku.
So the girl from kill bill is a weeaboo
Oh my god my brother told me to watch this¬†
thank you so much brother this is like the best thing ever
6:53 Every time.

"Just wanted a piece of Percy's ass you feel me"¬†

Keep it up Frank. This is the best shit I seen since the start of Youtube!
Oh Gawd that was soo hilarious!! Frank you did a good job! xD this has broken the deed of the weaboo franchises! XD
Oh my god I love you
we weeabos arent bad like you guys say.¬†
we just have better taste than stupid people like you.
because we go to anime conventions and we cosplay and buy figurines etc. it doesn't mean we're bad. weeabos are just cool. because we're different it doesn't make us bad. i only have one waifu, and i don't cheat on her, unlike people with real wives who cheat on them. weeabos aren't bad, you're just judging and generalizing. most weeabos actually have lives.¬†
just because i bought some naruto, dragon ball z, sailor moon, akame ga kill etc. things and cosplayed, it doesn't mean i'm a horrible person.
You do not know what you are talking about.
4:10¬†
"YOU BASTARD! CURSE YOU! WHAT THE?!! STOP THAT!"¬†

Those were the only Japanese words I understood in this video. Look what Inuyasha has taught me. :/
lol fuck weebs
ANYTHING BUT THE ANIME
top 5 anime:

1. everyone loves raymon
2. doug
3. fresh prince of bell air
4. simpsons

Sad part is i didn't think it was that bad
eh, i like some anime, you can tell by my pic but some people are just autistic about Japanese stuff
i am glad that i cant know what frank says in japanese, because i dont know japanese, because i am not a weaboo
My Favorite anime is Dora the Explorer.
„Åì„ÅÆÊ∞óÈÅï„ÅÑ„ÄÇ

Its funny
WOAH MAN THAT IS TOO FAR. You don't EVER dis attack on titan.
what the fuck is wrong with your voice?
Is Frank 52...

fucking asians
i didnt think this would be that funny omg
only part I dont understand is learning japanese with rosetta stone being a bad thing. Id like to learn japanese someday and I figure thats the only way id even stand a chance at it.
Are you mixed? full japanese? idk why im even asking
My grand pappy served in World War II and lemme tell ya, back then anyone's son caught copyin' a jap or mouthin' out some nipanese would get a good belt across the backside.
Im pretty sure Jimmy Newtron is best anime
10:03 agh! My childhood
This is funny as fuck.
Zack & Cody is best amine
Man I realy hate these peoples that use anime avatar >:(
who ever has one of those pillows should take there katana and stick it in there chest and pull sideways and let all of there guts spill out while cats eat it and shit iin there mouth -Filthy Frank has a point.
GOD FUCKING DAMMIT YOU BASTERD THAT REDNECK JOKE WAS UUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNCCCCCCCCAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLEEEEEDDDDDD FFFFFFFFFFFFFOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRR AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA JK LOL
Anime belongs in the trash
Hey Baws!
m8 Out of all my life. Of noscopeing and danking little ragers, You sir speak the truth. Ive seen these people everywhere. I watch anime but im not a weeabo, I am a X)_X_X_X_X_X_X_X_Noscoper, - This is all true 420/10 - IGN -
I know that there's some comments in here calling Frank an "ignorant American".
Filthy Frank is Japanese-Australian, dumbasses. -_-
Fucking weeaboos.
I really enjoyed this XD
KONICHUA YOU MAGNIFICENT MOTHERFUCKERS!
someone can please tell me what the fuck did he said at 2:36
"you know when I was younger...??????? I can't understand this part and i'm translating that part but damn sometimes he talks really fast
I want you to make a video for me frank. I want you to disrespect every last one of your fans and subscribers in a video. Call us sh*t, scum, cunts whatever I don't care. Just be the first pesos on to do it. Offend us all. Every last one of us. Please. We need it.
Fffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuuukkkkkkkkkk you it is a otaku shit you shit
Ummm.....I AM NOT HERE
There is nothing more cringeworthy than an anime. I don't get how people can sit for whole episodes of that shit.
Lets see if the Internet thinks I'm a weeaboo...
I'm a guy who occasionally watches anime and I also sometimes draw people in an anime style. However, I do not boast about how awesome anime is and if someone says anime isn't their thing, I'm fine with it.
YOU SIR NEED MORE SUBSCRIBERS! YOU ARE HYSTERICAL!
Everyone saying Cory in the House best anime but in my opinion, the Filthy Frank show is the best anime.
Yep earned my sub xD
This guy is way to good at those voices
this video challenges my sexuality
The best storylines of any anime are the ones from the airplane instruction videos from the 80s. The characters are well-developed, and display the persevering human spirit by describing stressful situations, while coming out of it all saying "enjoy your flight!". One boy had a tragic childhood, where he had to see his mom put her mask on before helping him put on his. Eventually, though, the team of flight attendants used their super saiyan ability called "land the plane" and the world was saved.

cake is good

My favorite anime is Pawn Stars...
shit! I understand all the Japanese he spoke at the beginning! I love Anime/manga but I don't deny my culture and want to be 'Japanese' lol I think there is a limit for every hobby but some people just take it to another level! by the way, awesome channel!
Theres a clear diffences between weeaboos and nerds who like japenese stuff.a weeaboo places japen on a huge pedistal and wants and thinks they can become japenese.  A nerd just like the things that come from there . Ex. A nerd goes to japan to see the contry and buy anime shit and play at there arcades. A weeaboo goes there because they think japen is the best place ever and is better they everywhere else even though japen has a shit load of fucked up problems. Dont be a weeaboo just be a nerd.
I love this :3
I find it ironic that there are so many people with anime profile pictures commenting on this video lol
+Legendary Queen Meulin Leijon --
SO FUCKING TRUE!
At 2:02 he sounds exactly like forneverworld
make a video bashing the Irish
The best anime is obviously the walking dead
Let's all keep in mind that there's a difference between weeaboos and otakus
10:08 - Dear God, not the Yaoi paddle! Death will come to us all!!!
Excellent video, man. Had me laughing all the way through. I know there is a difference between a weeaboo and a guy who just watches anime, but some people will call me a weeaboo anyway... I'm Mexican. I want to stay Mexican. I'll NEVER buy any posters, body pillows, figurines or any of that shit. I won't cosplay because fuck that. I don't care to learn another language just to fully enjoy a show. I just like to watch it... Even then, I don't watch much. Maybe like, a few episodes a month.
wow, i just relized that frank would be the best fucking voice actor
Seinfeld is an underrated anime.
LOL Y ALL THE WEEBS IN THE COMMENTS THO U KNOW WHO U ARE
for an asian girl instead of sounding like that i actually sound like a goat

you wasted my dreams.. you wasted my friends... AND NOW I WASTE YOUUUUUUUUUU "Insert very long power start thing here" WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


uh eh uh uhh hehh uhhh ehhe uhuhhh eehuyuh eh huh ehuhh

he no kill

BAAKAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This is now my official way of diagnosing Weeaboos.. (the irony)
Ohh shit frank needs some Jesus but I don't think he's tried that. :3
Is being otaku the same as being a weeaboo?
Is it weeabooish to use Rosetta Stone to learn Japanese because you want to work in the US foreign service, and you already know Chinese and Spanish (and English obviously) and want to fill out another garp? I mean, I like tokusatsu, and I collect Figuarts, but I can like those without getting all obsessed with learning Japanese. This is more about knowing the language of the country that we basically run the military of, and any potential job opportunities it could open up.
I understand better your japonaise than your english XD
Splatoon is the only real Hentai worth fapping 2 you see kids and squids
Darn
Why do 90% of people in the comments have anime profile pictures and/or names...
Thanks for addressing this Frank
Nononononono guys you got it all wrong,
The best anime is the cg Donkey Kong Country show from the 90s
What are you guys, uncultured snaaaaails?
Holy fuckin' shit man!!! It's have been a long time since i've laughed hard as this to a video, thanks bro!! I've watched this video kinda like 10 times already, and it's still funny! Love your videos man
I'm done üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Weaboos are the reason it took me so long to get into anime. I'm glad I gave it a shot despite some weirdo fans.
I'm lost
I died of laughter at 4:10 XD
was this sent towards my sister?
HAHAH OMFG "I LIKE PUSSY" AT 6:30
the thing that makes me a weeaboo is Cory In The House
Hey boss
i cant feel my face anymore
salamander was right 
those fucking nerds are in the comments
The Fresh Prince of bel air  is my favorite anime of all time
My favorite anime is Breaking Bad and the documentary "Bully"
I love manga,anime,vocaloid,jpop,jrock,japanese novels and yaoi and japanese history,but i also am madly inlove with my country and im very proud of it.
I dont collect weapons or post stuff in my room or things,but i would love to go to japan because i enjoy their language and i would love to learn more about the edo period n stuff.
Am i a weeabo? 

Lol 


Pls 

No

#bigbang
I admit, the video was fantastic and shows the flaws on being too obsessed with anime, the only thing i didn't agree with this was the pictures of cosplayers being shown. Just because we cosplayers cosplay as our favorite fictional characters means that we are a Weeaboo.
What even... NICE !
I have an obsession with filthy frank
weeaboo
._.
Pink guy is my favorite ._.
1:53 holy shit that face reminds me of Jean Reno XD
frank's funniest video
Filthy frank is my favorite anime.
and you're a alright person xD
DAT LAUGH XD in the begining
all the people with anime profile pictures
Bobby hill is a weeaboo
He literally fucked over all the fat nerds in the world who think like this
How many times does frank voice crack in this video
Oh my god, I just realized I know a kid at my school that NO JOKE does the same voice as this weeaboo. He always tries to talk to be about Attack On Titan, and EVERY SINGLE TIME he sees me he points out my shirt and is like, "NIce SHirt."
It got to a point where I just told him to fuck off and not point it out every chance he gets and that I didn't even like the show that much. But yea, on a lighter note i'm 70% sure he is mentally handicapped.
He's 52????
9:09 what is that sword from? its sooo cool I want one
My favourite anime's consist of lazy town, spongebob, scrubs, and breaking bad. Epic masterpieces
Franku loves him some Angel Blade and Bible Black. Yo Media Blasters knows what's up bruh.
He is being rasist about other coalters he should go die in a ditch you fucking fayget
im pretty sure the sauske guy at hooters is a straight baller
You know what really annoys me? People who make YouTube accounts with anime character names or actually worse people who make Facebook accounts with anime characters names. Youtube is actually kind of fine but Facebook?
There's  that point where even Frank laughed at his joke.
OMFG THIS IS BUTIFUL
When he said roseta-stone... he sounded like videogame dunkey. Wait...
Frank a lot of people are hating on gravity falls and I was wondering if u like the show if u don't it's cool
I love you
Weeaboobies.
Ohok.
Boy Meets World is the best anime ever
4:10 If that was you... damn! You should be a voice actor also that sounded familiar.
At 6:20 was the best part
still suprised this doesnt have thousands of dislikes due to weabooooz
Cory in the house is my senpai
3:05 Uh... well this is awkward.
I'm not a weeaboo I'm just an otaku
Is he actually speaking Japanese in the video? (it sounds kinda real)
Cory in the house
San Diego has a lot of japanese ppl there and other foreign ppl
Also, I shall eagerly await your hate-video on bronies. Please, do continue.
It shall be... Exhilarating to watch.

THIS IS AMAZING XD!!!
i collect weapons and explosives, does that mean i'm a terrorist?
What if you're¬†learning Japanese because you're actually generally interested in the language? ¬†Am i still weeaboo?
Except that Frank is like 20/21-years-old, not fifty something.
Can a japanese person still be a weeaboo?
Wrong. Anyone who watches anime is weaboo trash. Drink bleach
My favorite anime is law and order
My favorite anime is Cory in the House
buuuuut this is a major but my freind i think mey be a weeaboo for the fact that he has attack on titan colection -_-
Ok so i like kill la kill dosent mean im a weeaboo im just like what frank said a person who enjoys anime and dosent giva shit bout japaland.

Almost fucking died with the japanese cartoon voice acting impression
I hope you know that it's not just White people that are weeaboos. Asians/Africans/Hispanic can all be called weeaboos at some degree. And even though weeaboo is defined to be a non-Japanese person, there are also plently of Japanese who act the exact way as weeaboos.
One day, we shall purge the world of Weeabus with lube-covered frying pans.
wtf your japanese is actually good are you japanese
Lmao I'm not a weeaboo but I do learn Japanese through anime üòÇ

What's worse a weaboo or a bronie?  :0/
the cory in the house joke is overused smfh
1:44 - 2:15
weeaboo wow a perfect definition of my fucking EX
You just earned my subscription GG WP
I'm into anime yet I found this shit hilarious xD
The song was my favorite part.
"Rosetta Stone" XDDD
weaboos are 4 fucbois; koreaboos masterrace
I like how all of these weeaboos act like this video isn't describing them.
Most weeaboos are fat and japan has some of the least fat people so luckily the weeaboos arent in japan
I guess I would qualify as a weeaboo, but I'm not 42 and live in my parents' house
This was my first Filthy Frank video.. My ass wasn't buttered up enough for this when I started.
Fuck you guys the cocoa puff commercials are my favorite anime.
actually in japanese porn sites real like asian do moan like 13 year old. It's so annoying. I got a boner and i'm ready to fap but then it's like ''NYAAAAH'' and i'm like nope i'm done ZIP. I do not want a Asian women as a wife if she's gonna sound 13
You are 52? Bullshit.
So there actually is someone out there who knows the difference between a person who likes anime and these sick fucks
This video is a work of art.
great scot! where do u get ur skinny jeans
I don't mind cosplay but if you're gonna cosplay make sure it's good
"My waifu is coming too life"

Oh god..üòÇ
cory in the hous
Me: Dying dolphin noise
I sit on a bus next to weeaboo
 He told me "Japan fought with more honor than USSR". He called me a dumb American liar when I made him look up The Rape of Nanjing. He also brags about owning a Katana, he didn't even pronounce Katana right.
i let a 52 yr old man with glasses and a dirty shirt tell me what to do with my life
I dont like anime
RIP dreams
Its not as fun if you guys don't know japanese
All of you haven't seen a real anime until you've seen Attack on Walking Dead or Breaking Bad Bebop.
if there is a new kid from japan thats in my school and i try learning japanese to make them feel at home does that mean im a weeaboo ;-;
Personally, Frank, my favorite animes consist of Birdemic, Bill Nye the Science Guy, and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
My Favorite Animes are The Simpsons Breaking Bad and The Universe: a SpaceTime Oddissey
Shit, my favourite anime consits of fucking Powerpuff girls and Postman Pat!
I love how we never use the Avatar for what it is for,  which is our face. At least I actually made my avatar in Photoshop...
Wait... you're 52!?!???!
It's Skyrim, not Thomas
If someone committed genocide on weebs would anyone care tbh
those pics made me cringe at the end

other then that im in tears from this video xD
I miss you frank. Is been 3 months.
There is nothing wrong with obsessively collecting weapons....
when frank speaks in japanese i get really turned on
Cory In The House best anime
Shit this guy is amazing

...is he HowToBasic?
I know think of Thomas talking like filthy frank XD
Im black. I dress like a black guy. (wear nike shoes) Talk like a white guy. Watch anime and want to take Japanese classes. People call me a weeaboo. Mainly over the internet but still. What the hell.
Press 4 and 7 to create orgasms.
0 - to laugh
3 - heavy breathing
You don't know real anime! My animes are adventure time and legend of korra like OMG ATTACK ON TITAN OMG!
Russian weebs are almost just as bad.
Who else thinks papa Franku is as attractive as fuck?
Am I a weaboo if I was introduced to Japan by anime and watch anime a lot but I'm interested in the Japanese culture and language and want to visit Japan one day?
I feel like the minority here cus everyone has anime profile pics here
can you talk normally for like 5 seconds

my favorite anime are south park and old racist cartoons and friends is oke to
I'm immune to the weeabo virus 
Why didn't you use my blood ;_;
We All Know That The Bear In The Big Blue House Is The Best Anime.
wow just wow, that is most retarded video ive ever seen... u fking dont know anything about those people's life and fking judge them like u were a fking expert. You even said u dont watch it and u are not interested, regardless u fking talk shit about topic U HAVE NONE KNOWLEDGE
He makes a Sound around 08:00 and it sounds like : ITTTAAYYO?  What does that mean or is it just a scream he does xD?
this is very filthy¬†


i like it¬†
i like it alot
Hahhahahahahah virgin realm
Let's fucking burn these weeaboo
I almost felt bad for myself because I thought I was a weaboo...

But then I remember: Though I am probably super-obsessed with Anime, and I think Japan is pretty cool, I love where I live and I respect my culture.

Also, WHERE HAS THIS CHANNEL BEEN SINCE I JOINED YOUTUBE?
7 months later and this video is still great
Wow... So many sad cases on here just desperate for likes on their comments. Pathetic.
Funny video. I'd love to move to Japan and learn the language. Japan has a great culture and an interesting history, I'm a history nut! ¬†Not to mention Manga and Anime is great! The food... not my cup of tea though xD.

I'm a borderline Weeaboo? #Yolo. Fuck it if I am.
t the fuck did I just watch
Everything in this video is completely reasonable.
Haha! This is funny!
Frank I know this is a old video but some did a RE  to this and I would love to see what you think of 1-border line pedophile how weeaboo he is his channel is phionx shadow
Is there a reason he talks with that stupid voice?
Why do you keep talking like that =(, i died
Is it wrong for me to like Japanese Culture..?
I have someone I know who loves Asian people so much he whispers in my ear "omg Asian" and I look at him as if to say: 
"really? are you kidding me?". (I love anime and I think the Japanese culture is very interesting but dear lord there's¬†a limit.)
How Enemies Now Take All Imps.
For The Win.
Oh my god. The comment section is filled with them!
People don't get the point of this video, a person is not a weeaboo for watching anime, they're a weeaboo if they try to be japanese but ethnically they're not
Damn :( I'm half a weeaboo I think. I started learning japanese, I own a fucking shit load of mangas and I read books on japanese culture. I don't have that weird pillow shit though. I actually also planned on figuring out if I could move to Japan. Someone please tell me if I'm a "weeaboo" or not. I found out the meaning of that word in this video. I don't own swords or weird shit like that. Personally I think I'm just very passionate about japanese culture (mainly mangas, but not only. history, folklore, gastronomy, language, etc). I really wonder if that makes me a weeaboo.
Fuck you frank anime is the best thing since sliced bread stop being such a cringe generator and do something with your life go ahead and post hate comments on this comment IDGAF
This comment section is filled with people using anime profile pics trying to be funny, be warned.
Love papa franku (No Homo)
MY FAVORITE ANIME IS COWBOY BEBOP!!!!!
This is more accurate, and the frank haters don't want to admit it.
I love how everyone in the comments are using an anime picture, counting me.
I'm not a weeaboo, I love the culture and the language. The reason being, is its more fun.. and the irish culture is boring.. I do dream of going to japan IF i learn the whole language.¬†

Funny video tho :3
I can't stop laughing. XD
Bash on the bronies next pls
The best anime ever! You all know it!!! Cory in the house!
10:10. DOES THAT GUY HAVE FUCKING TITS?!
Saw this video in "recommended for you" on my homepage...
Thanks Youtube.
insecurity intensifies
I'm not a Weeaboo if I have Asian Blood, right? BTW anime is terrible, the katana sucks (reason being is because early in WW2 the Chinese and Japanese fought at the Great Wall. The katana and the Chinese Dadao were pitted against one another. Long story/battle short, the Chinese won and shattered every single katana used by the Japanese while they fought), and China has more land, better food, and better martial arts!
filthy is a legend
liking anime=weeaboo
eventhoughfrankdidntsaythat

but you know who am i say
Frank, I was just in a baby earthquake while watching you. Your panic was the background to what felt like two people fucking hardcore on the tectonic plates
This nigga just diss Ken-Sama?
Is he the guy who started the harlem shake?
So I'm Japanese so I'm not a weeb
Same.
Hannah Montana is my favorite hentai
My favourite anime was Pac Man's reveal trailer for Smash Bros 4.
Is it wrong to be addicted to this video?
Everywhere.
Love how everyone who watches anime is flipping out. If u didn't realize, he's not talking shit about anime, he's taking shit about people that think there Japanese even tho ther white as fuck
firshy frankshoue

You're making me, laugh too much xD
My favorite anime is Avatar: The last airbender and The legend of Korra
Can jacksfilms and Filthy frank make a vid together
Wow this is Awome(many jacks then repeat Awome) this is freaking awsome btw
Most used phrases in an anime series: 4:09
Can someone please tell me wtf I just watched?
I need more Filthy Frank in my life.
So when are you getting¬†that stoma to go with that voice?
Does watching Hitomi Tanaka make me a weeaboo?
S/O to the people who whack off to these kinds of shit. Reminds me of an old friend I have in 8th grade.
Are you making fun of Thomas the tank engine!?
I am the motherfucking Tank engine!
You don't wanna fuck with a tank engine m9!
Does he throw a fucking kunai at him from tf2 XD
How is he not a voice actor?!?!
FUCKING KATANAS ARE SHIT WEAPONS IN GENERAL ANYWAY

ALL THAT FUCKING "THEY CAN SLICE THROUGH ANYTHING" IS PURE WEEABOO FANTASY TRASH

EVEN FEUDAL JAPAN, THEY MOSTLY USED SPEARS AND SHIT
EVEN THE METAL THEY ARE MADE OUT OF ARE INFERIOR ANYWAY
why are you yelling at me
ÁßÅ„ÇíÊÑõ„Åó„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ
Weeaboos Aren't bad or something!~ They're Just.. like you know!~ Like Being A fan!~ Collecting what they like to make them like!~ You know A real otaku or something!~ What's bad being a weeaboo!~ What's wrong being a wapanese(wannabe japanese)!!Even If they're a Weeabo they are also a Person too!~ A humankind!~ Just saying!~ !~ And I'm not saying that I'm a weaboo!~
1,439 Weeaboos need to reconnect with reality!
Holy fucking shit just thank you for existing.
My favourite anime is the fresh prince of bell air
Salamander man can play a recorder with his nose.
Can I hire him for my band?
Fuck man
Weaboos ruins the anime fandom and the Japanese culture.
What's a chromosome? Is it a unit of time? I jus wanna know so I can keep up lol
I haven't laughed so hard in a while!!
My favorite anime is cailluo
satire?
S√≥ acho que sou um dos poucos brasileiros a assistir este canal... ou o √∫nico...
6:57 hey boss
I'll Find You And Kill You My Katana Need Blood Your Blood
Fuck You
As I kid I was always fascinated with swords even before seeing anime. I've only collected one katana and a gladius.

My favs are rapiers, katanas, and the leaf blades and elven swords ._.
I collect Japanese weapons but I use them to kill people. Is that acceptable?
source of image at 1:19?
Give me the chords to weaboo now!!!
I wonder what its like living next to frank
jk
DONT TALCK ABOUT WEEABOOS

Kappa

weeaboos go to japan and be like
CAN I HAVE A HAMBURGER PLS
*gets a salisbury steak with a side of fried rice*
Hey b0ss
Im something opposite than weeaboos.I watch anime for long time, but still don't know 20 words hahaha :D But idgf i enjoy anime :)
Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the most American cartoons I've ever seen. But DAMN, that G.I. Joe anime from the 1980s was SO fucking Japanese!!!
This is the word of god
as you're acting so exxagerated, it looks to me like you got a bigger problem than the weeabos you're flaming about...
...This made me rethink my life...XD I think i'm borderline weeaboo
I was watching this when my dad walked into my room, and he started watching too.¬†
We both got cancer.
But its okay.
We'll just smoke some marijana to cure it.
Please stop using anime avatars as your profile picture its gay
I'm breathing very heavy and I'm typing on my keyboard... you ...you !!!!!!! Funny person:D
btw... melonpan is an awsome troll :D and the prime weaboo go an check him out :D
I know I am using a Japanese name to not reveal my real name and I have an anime pic as my profile but I just wanted 2 say this video was so funny I had to subscribe. According to my friends I act like a weeaboo because I love anime and I like the japanese language but I'm not full on weeaboo. My best friend said Im some kind of weeaboo half breed. No I cannot stand unhygenic places and I take a shower everyday üòÇ anyways if anyone is sick of weeaboos I guess u can take it on me since I can understand how frustrating being with a weeaboo could be (i have a good imagination) tbh I feel sorry 4 them because they don't really have anyone and they probably won't have a good future.
Fucking funnies shit üòÇ just the shit u say and how u say it üëç
fuck you westaboo
THATS SO FUNNY
I died a lil bit in the inside when I found out freaky frank was a normal guy IRL
I fucking love this show. I have now been signed up on a depression site for suicidal people.. Thanks Frank <3
I don't really see a problem with collecting weapons though
~uguu
I love anime but I can't defend it now  this is too funny to be mad atüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ching chong japanese things ching ching chong ninja star rasist comment
HES 52?!?!
I'm fine with people collecting all that anime stuff cause there is a thing called an otaku in Japan which I assume its just someone who gets obsessed over something. It only gets weird when you make it you're whole life.¬†Honestly I've kinda drifted away from anime this year but I feel like I'm not missing much. Now I'm just collecting for other franchises like video games or comics.
4:33 is a work of art
Put on the captions its hilarious
How to find weaboos
Step 1: go to¬†https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFQQALduhzA
Step 2: look through comments
Step 3: "Attack on Titan is shitty af"
I heard alot of things about this channel and after watching this video I have to say you one of the funniest people on YouTube.
Around 10:09 I saw the image and went "Wait, was there ponies on the shelf?" so I rewinded and paused at that image. IT WAS PONIES WHAT I SAW! Worst part is when I looked at the rest.

>ponies (some of the 2nd generation of MLP, which look creepy as fuck)
>Sega Dreamcast, Genesis and Megadrive (not sure about the last, but looks like he has it)
>Sonic plush toys
>Pokemon toys and posters
>a self made pendant of a character that has both Pikachu and Sonic design characteristics

Looking at the face complexion now... oh no... naw... GAWD NAO! IT'S CHRIST CHANDLER! This is definately him before he went SJW transqueerfag recently. He's the guy who came up with the shitty Sonichu (donut steel muh charactur) and he's the guy no fandom wants to have on.
My favorite animu is High School Musical
Hey, hey, don't talk shit about Attack on Titan. It's a really good show

Gosh
did the definition of weeaboo change over the years? Like, wasn't it just a buncha neckbeards that do nothing but jizz over anime all the time & disregard their own culture?
I used to be a weeaboo. I watch anime, I play JRPGs, I read manga sometimes, but I like dubbed anime... and also, I used to jizz over Japan, but now I am a veteran weeaboo.
I AM A PROUD AMERICAN!


I'm Puerto Rican but shut up I'm a westaboo now.
+Kai
My waifu would smack your ass ,but she is 2D ;c
why the fuck did I take so long to discover this channel. Its amazing!
1,33 hahhaha corry in the house omg i wachted that back when i was a little kid
1:17 name of the animeeeee :Dpls
I laughed at the whole video but what's the problem with collecting katanas?
Am I a "westaboo" if I collect Claymores?
XD
I'm 29% percent weeaboo senpai
Am I the only one who thinks Pink Guy has a beautiful voice?
wew lad
Oh come on katanas aren't that weard. I would love Zoro's katanas.
As real WOMENS wow

Wanna see something crazy? Read the Filthy Frank channel description.

What's the Darude Sandstorm starting at 7:20?
Frank, you slut. What's that damn oriental music that starts at 5:58?
my waifu is scout from tf2 :D
so many ppl call me a weeaboo, but get this im actually fuckin Japanese >:I
and you forgot to tell about those anime girls that think they are anime dolls with super make up and poker face, alaways wearing pikachu pijamas
#waifu  dont talk shit about attack on titan.
MY NAME IS....COWBOY TANAKA.
If you notice his beard grows when he gets in the chamber
its funny cuz i understood every single word u said in japanese.
This is precisely why I'm glad I'm an otaku and not a weeaboo...
I find his Japanese voice at the start oddly attractive

I sure hope that doesn't make me a weeaboo...
boy this comment section is a mess just looking at it makes me depressed
9:21

Hurts
Shit
you need to do same about furries or bronys
My favorite anime ism The Boondocks. I dressed up as Uncle Rukus for the last Anime Con.
So a weeaboo is like the Japanese version of a wigger.
When weaboos attack X'DDDDDD
I love anime but this guy is totally right about weeaboos I don't know all about japan cause and i know im not Japanese im a kid that is from poland but i can like Japan c: filthyfrank you have made my day by this video and somewhere in this text i spelled something wrong I think im correct and even though i might coseplay one day im not going to be a guy that says "IM JAPANESE CAUSE I WATCH ANIME." Lmao filthyfrank gg you are a funny guy XD
+TVFilthyFrank¬†Papa Franku, please do a video talking about bronies, thanks b0$$ (:
this video is a good reason and to think after watching a video called "The Adventures Of Butthurt Anime Fan"
Lol
there also called wizards lmao!!!!
wait is that a chelsea jersey..?

doubt it...
I took an Asian Cultures class in school way before I started watching Anime and I starting learning Japanese and I like to visit Japan. I appreciate Japanese culture, far past just anime. ¬†But I haven't abandoned my culture or ethnicity. I don't think I'm Japanese and I don't try to act like it. I'm also learning Spanish. I just like cultures and Learning different languages. I don't collect stuff or obsess over anything.. Do I appear like a weeaboo to people when I speak Japanese? Should I just quit?
Cory in the House is the best anime
ive been learning japanese on tvfiltyhfrank
I use an anime avatar for my steam profile because I think it's cute...
But that doesn't make me a smelly, dirty weaboo does it?

.....................right guys?
Also, they're like two types of weeaboos. 
The really annoying ones who uses "owo" "<u<" and is so hyped up and doesn't make any sense at all when you try to talk to them.

The other one is the rude weeaboo.
These weeaboos doesn't take shit from anyone. If you say something about their favorite anime, they will kill you and your family and then they're going to summon their weeaboo friends to attack you as well. 
I don't even know which one I hate the most.
yeh man...i listen only to j-pop...i'm soooo japanese
Am I the only one who's wondering how his voice isn't gone yet?
My favorite anime is River Monsters
He's making me laugh so hard. I think i'm having a heart attack....
" Hey if you enjoy a little hentai here and there ..... " ~ Frank
Omg true!!!!! LOL
I don't get why people always call me a Weaboo but all I do that us like..Japanese culture or whatever is watch anime
This is the best shit I've seen.
I love you
I still wanna be thomas the tank engins
I bought a katana yeeeeeeeaaaaaars before I even started watching anime... what does that make me?
Jesus Christ I can't agree more with this video
Lol, i'm an anime fan and i think this is quite enjoyable. It also makes it clear that you can be a fan without being a weeaboo. Serious question here: i just watch anime and i have some manga in my attic. Sometimes i say "baka" to troll my friends (they don't watch anime). Does that make me a weeaboo? :/
herro, I amu cowboi taraka.
POUNDING AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This was the first video I watched of this channel. At the start of the video I thought it would be some guy ranting in Japanese. 15 seconds later I was laughing my ass off. Since then this channel has not disappointed me in the slightest.
Your funny dood. Haters goa  hate
I'm a fucking hustler
Humanity at its finest...
mkay i get it but i got one question... what the fuck is a body pillow? is it those long pillows like in the pictures with some anime girl on them? can someone xplain pls
PFFFT

Rip in pepperonis filthy frank's dream to become Thomas the tank engine :(
i collect weapons.

I just started watching your videos and I love them almost all. I also watched filthy frank expose and i really wished Joji made vlogs, Joji seems better then filthyfrank to me, plus filthyfrank is just a character.
ey b0ss, gibe de pusi pls
Weaboo Protection Chamber Music? PLEASE!!
I FUCKING HATE WEEABOOS
So you're telling me that I shouldn't use Rosetta Stone to learn Japanese?
i gagged at the weeaboo slide show in the end of the vid... well aslong as they keep it to themselves and stay out of Japan I'm fine with it.
My favourite anime has to be game of thrones.
I am not a weaboo, however i do like watching anime and other stuff ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) but i don't pretend to be Japanese or anything like that.
this is fucking gold!!!
I have noticed there is too many people who want to be Japanese or Korean, just one too many. Western culture has sucked lately and they haven't come up with anything cool or worth it so everyone looked elsewhere, that's what caused this.
"Hallo... Mai nayme is-a... Cowboi Tarakah."
Sex invertebrates!
Your channels are the 8th wonder of world.
Zack and cody is a bad anime

"Creep"(Weeaboo Edition)

When you were here before, you didn't notice me.

Please notice me Senpai. Just please hear my plea.

I'm always so lost.... In an anime world.
I wish I was special... You're so fuckin' special.

But I'm a creep... I'm a weeaboo...
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts,
I want to be Japanese. 
I want a big katana.
I really want it, please.

I want you to notice...
 Notice me senpai.
You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special.

But I'm a creep, I'm a weeaboo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here, I don't belong here...
I got too lazy to watch anime anymore lol. College and work are more important to me now.
I found this hillarious.




So,should I change my DBZ username now?
Fox news is my favorite anime. I  fucking love obama-senpai <3
Bene your eZ i was the emerald donar. AchillePlaysGame Heres a tip tho!

You got two dead people in your closet huh. You lied to people with your subtitles sir!
Share it everywhere, this is fucking art.
American Tolerating Lvl : Filthy Frank
I thank Japan, Frank's black father and mother for creating him. And I thank Frank for creating this Youtube Channel. I bless him with the Stanic Ability of devouring souls as a reward. Carry on Filthy Frank. Carry on my child. And don't forget to bathe in the blood of sacrificed autistic children. #b0ss
Listening to Frank giggle at himself is ducking hillarious

I like how people in this comment section say "Ha fucking weaboos" and they're obviously weaboos with obvious fucking japanese avatars.
I like anime but I also like your channel franky,what to do?

Ew your voice sucks.
I don't like your videos and I don't find you funny, so I am going to leave and respectfully ignore you and whenever my friends go on about how funny you are I am going to politely stay out of the conversation and am not going to say anything bad about you because I respect all the work you do making people's lives happier and respect my friends' choice of entertainment.

But seriously, go kill yourself.
cory in the house killled me
Those false subtitles at the beginning lol. Being half Japanese and knowing the language made that so much funnier!

ON THIS VIDEO

I AM IN THE WRONG BUSINESS.
thomas the tank engine lol that was my shit back in the day
Anime is fucking trash!
I don't see what's wrong with...

-having a anime pic as yr avatar. Fanart counts? 
-swearing in Japanese. (So no one knows what you are saying...)
-having shitloads of manga and anime merch (just shows yr appreciation for the anime)
-saying that your favorite anime is the best and not talk shit about it (yr just defending what you like and nothing else)

There are people out there who appreciate anime and they do all these things to show others that they love this anime. I mean, if you wanted to show the world that this anime is the best, what would you do? ._.
I hate this guy but at the same time I don't hate this guy.
FINALLY! someone who knows how I feel about these freaks!! Bless you Frank, bless you for shining a light on this problem and exposing the filthy Weeaboos!
i found out the most ghetto as fuck kid in my high school is highly addicted to naruto
Oh god I spend 50% of my day at school side by side with these weebs and otakus. I mean one of them came to schools fully dress in an anime schools girl dress and she said " don't even judge me" I mean if you didn't want to be judged then why say or do that all of them wan the attention that's the big thing they're just too dang proud of their obbsesion I mean that's the real problem
Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman is my all time favorite anime.
Is being a Anglophile bad?
But what if you're a girl?
OMGOMGOMOGMOGMOGM HENTAI IS VERY FRECREGFFGFEWSJUIDSKXJXCEWCCREAAT5IVE OMG U DONT INSULT HENTAI ITS HOT
Where has this channel been all my life?
Once i met a weeaboo, probably a phase 2 weeaboo. It was on a friends meeting at a cafe.
It was fun, i told her about great animes i made up in my mind like "Triclopassion" and "Tenchu garey icho panay" and she totally swallowed it.
GUYS AT 10:15 THIS GUY HAS GOT AN YT CHANNEL XDDD
I love that channel tbh
His channel is called melon pan
Its german though
Sometimes there are subtitles
One of his videos is called germanys eraction „Éæ(¬Ø‚àáÔø£‡πë)
Have fun xD
this is still my favorite video of him ever like damn this is real shit
"FUCK YOU WEEABOO JONES! ¬†I LOVE FAMILY GUY!" I lost it xD
I'm a fuckin weaboo
Some anime are good. ¬†Most are garbage. ¬†I'll watch a little from time to time, but man do I hate the general fanbase. ¬†They're pretty annoying.
http://bosscade.com/d?r=byrVfZsVb
Anyone but Weaboo Jones!
Holy shit, how many packs a day do you smoke, dude?
That poor shirt has been through so much
You guys are stupid!! The best anime is Suitlife of zack and cody!!
I love anime but I can't help feeling that some of it was created to be made fun of
#stoptheweaboos
.filthy frank your a dumfuck
this was funny XD
Something about anime
I can't stop laughing... Anyway

I don't want to learn Japanese, I don't care about Japan, I don't care if Japan gets blown up as long as One Piece gets an ending, 90% of Anime these days are bullshit and otaku magnet, Attack on Titan is overrated.

I also watch The Walking Dead and Black Sails.

As much as I hate weeaboos, not everyone with an anime avatar is one, Juz sayin.
So isn't he Japanese and being an American wannabe now,I want a word to describe that symptom.
Um I'm new to this Channel so can someone fill me in?!?
Like is this a parody of some people and what is this channel about??!
Those people really exist ?? i cant believe that shit , if its true i feel really sad somehow for them , lol i even post this before i finish the video in the end and u stole the words from me .
Cringe, and yes I know I'm being ironic
Does frank live in a fucking office building? How did he get to a conference centre?
Frank never fails to disappoint.
Huh, I thought a neckbeard was a beard made out of the flesh that would normally be considered the neck but hangs out due to fat.
I was looking at an English dub of attack on Titan this morning. I thought the dub was awful. I go to voice my opinion about it and I see an army of people calling everyone a weeaboo for disliking it. What in all hell is a weeaboo, I thought. I read a few posts and began to feel self conscious. Then I stumble across your video here. You gave a very clear description of a weeaboo and I immediately felt better. Any how! You got yourself another subscriber! Ya gravely voiced funny guy!
"I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass, you feel me?" -Filthy Frank 2014
Ore wa ochinchin ga daisuki nandayo!
FUCK CORY IN THE HOUSE, FILL OF THE FUTRE WAS MY ANIME! ;U
Cory in the House was actually my first anime and I enjoyed it immensely!
Anime is fucking retarded
Jappanese cartoons? stfu fagot
My favorite anime is World War 2 propaganda.
The weeabo protection chamber realm has a distinct lack of chromosomes
I'm ashamed to say that the kid on the deck holding the two knives down goes to my school... ;-;
YEAH! I WATCH FAMILY GUY! I'M A DECENT HUMAN BEING! YAY!
Dude, I don't think you have the right to judge anyone when you're a raging homo who dances around in public like a retard wearing a pink spandex suit. You disturb me more than the weeaboos
Lmaooo all these fucking weeaboos in the comments with anime profile pictured are like "ha ha this is so true""

Bruh, you know laughing at it don't make you any less of a weeaboo.
Ethnically you aren‚Äôt Japanese,mixed at most.
But you have grown in Japan.You speak Japanese almost the same as native.
Lmao as far as I can see what this guy said is right on the spot. Now I'm a anime fan but I don't go Hardcore by collecting fuigirines or some body pillow,etc. ¬†I've been living in japan for about 4 years now, I say the life around here is pretty boring I would rather go back living in America. Japan's not really what everyone expects it to be.
11:19 that's the funniest picture I've ever seen, what the fuck happened there?
At 0:09 Papa Franku actaully says: "There are two Jewish guys in my closet, they're both dead."
Please do a video about those Fucking Retarded Nintendo fanboys.

They're annoying as hell!!!!!!
Ur voice makes me orgasm
Rosetta Stone
Hey Boss
I feel bad for those old badass japanese people like war veterans who have to deal with the great weeaboo migration in Japan. It shames their heart to see what japan has become  since the war ended. Thousands of fat weeaboos have migrated to japan and caused thousands of japanese people to commit seppuku
Looks like the pot calling the kettle a weeaboo?
Haha awesome to see people here writing: "Yeah, I'm not a weeaboo, I hate them". While using an anime avatar. Fucking weeaboos, fucking manchilds borderline pedophiles supporting fucking animes.
1370 people are weebs
Hero, my name is... Cowboy Tanaka.
1 - Go to 7:56.
2 - Close your eyes.
3 - Holy Shit.
WEEABOOS rekt m9
PAPA FRANKU PLZ heavy breathing Awesome video barrel of laughs xD, Can you please tell me the name of the song that comes up when you hide in the Weaboo Protection Chamber? I think I have heard it before but I can't pin it down plz help xD
You no, his voice, when he is making it disgusting, is not that bad.
Furrys next
Weeaboos are shit; katanas are fucking awesome.
+TVFilthyFrank¬†Hey Frank, how are George and Joji doing by the way? Haven¬¥t heard from them in a long-ass time.
WHERE HAS THIS SHIT BEEN
Thinking of subbing after the Seinfeld joke lmao
WANNA BE MY FRIEND ? DON'T WORRY, YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE !
1368 weeaboos pressed the dislike button , don't let this madness spread any further we can get rid of this disease forever guys.
I agree with you on every point, except the weapon collecting part. Collecting weapons is actually pretty cool. In my opinion, the red flag should be raised at cosplaying.
Have you noticed that practically every sector of society is full of people undergoing total identity crisis?
7:20 what song is that, sounds pretty good.
1:05¬† Voice break xD
4:11 What's he saying?
What about bushido folowers? :(
Bruh. This guy speaks the truth. You can like anime, hell, i even love anime, but if you are some fuck who doesnt take a shower, thinks Japan is the only place that exists, and pushes your stupidness onto others, it becomes really fucking annoying.
People watch this shit?
I heard someone say anime!
This is bullcrap! your not funny your weird with ridiculous voice! i just want to punch your face until you gain your shame!
I'd love to see a rant against bronies. I know it will gain way too much hate but isn't this the show to present all of that? (Yes I know you do other shit mane)
EMG SONT TLK SHIT BOUT TACKOTIRAN UTS HAS A GOOD PLOT SO MUCH FUXKING HATE BRUH 
(Please it was just a joke üòÉ)
That video got it right, but just one question, is that dude Japanese?
I want to live with and or next to Frank just to listen to half the shit that he does
Your voice becomes less raspy when you speak in japanese its kinda hot
„Ç™„Çø„ÇØ„Åß
my favorite animu is sugoi quest for kokoro
Cory in the house, best animay of all time.
Fuckin' weeaboos, man.
Anywhere you go, they're there.
Jimmy neutron is the best anime
The one thing I can relate to is the Attack on Titan. xD
I love that show.
dont you fucking talk shit about my avatar
+professor. Ding leberry
Damn, Japanese on point!
ROSARIO + VAMPIRE.
What anime is that on 1:17?
4:16 had me crying :D
Your fucking hilarious and sooo cute.
These are some fun comments.
"My favorite amines consist of toy story, Corey in the house, airplane instruction videos from the 80s, and Seinfeld." Lol
Best part:
4:10-4:20
Very Funny, but ¬†have swords ore katanas doesnt make you a weeaboo...

It can be just a preparing for the apocalypse...
Anybody else hate themselves for creaming a little at the beginning?
Anime sucks
rasengan... rosetta stone..
i want weaboo jones to perform oral sex on me
One of the best comment sections in YouTube.

6/9 "Would fap again." -IGN
You mean that two Jews died and one weeaboo revived.
Omfg... Some people need help, that Weeaboo song had some fucked up people in it, I mean, I watch anime and I respect the Japanese culture, but people out there are entirely covering there walls with posters, sleeping with body pillows, buying cardboard cut-outs and katana's because OF A FUCKING TV SHOW?!?! THEY NEED TO GET JOBS AND EARN A RESPECTABLE LIVING, THEN THEY CAN MAKE A MASTERBATION  DUNGEON DEDICATED TO WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY WANT, BUT DONT JUST COVER YOUR ROOM WITH AN ANIMATED SERIES THAT IS SEMI POPULAR! HOLY FUCK IM ANGRY, THANKS FILTHY FRANK YOU SON OF A BITCH
0:42-0:50 = every Weeaboo's favorite part
Fuck anime!!!!
Why were the police arresting that weeaboo?
I only watch dubs
King of the Hill is the best anime.
HAHAHAHAHA HOW AM I JUST FINDING OUT ABOUT THIS GUY? Subscribeeeeeeeeee.
Damn, why didn't I find this channel earlier.
Time to explore this channel
This is comedy
10:03 looks like one of the classmates from malcolm in the middle
07:19 song name?
2mil views and 700k subscribers
How can anyone use Rosetta stone to learn japanese, I used it and didnt learn ANYTHING from it
This is the funniest shit.... ever.
The black guy holding the sex pillow is Mad Thad. He's in prison for owning child porn, no joke.
I'm just doing math homework, and i relise i'm listening to J-pop... Stupid youtube.

I ended up running out of my house screaming "ITS COMING"
Phahah xD OMG I could not stop laughing haha dude you are hilarious!
Don't talk shit about Attack On Titan...

Actually you can talk shit about it because it sucks now anyway
HEEY! I'M A FUCKING WEEABOO!
Frankxsekai ........makoto can fuck off
Gas the weebs
2:02 was the FORNEVERWORLD?
I will murder you with my cheap unauthentic swords purchased mostly from anime conventions and amazon, probably built in a Chinese sweatshop with shoddy spot welded tangs and horrible construction..

Frank-san, you will soon meet your overly bloody end, because my swords are probably better used as bats.. so ill be seriously slamming you.. it's going to be gross.
I just found out about this channel, what happened to him?
The amount of Weeaboos in CS:GO is too damn high...
Can I have an anime profile picture? But not call myself a Japanese?
this video is funny as crap because its so true the things is i like anime but its not like im a obsessive weirdo :3
lmao
Comment number 22222
22222
Weeb
Damn Weeboos and their Korean cartoons!
Now that I know there is a word for people like that I can't fucking stop using it even out of context because it sounds too funny XD
Oh sweet Jesus, the Screaming.
Rasengan......Rosetta Stone
I really enjoy my anime but this was fucking hilarious hahaha.
I fucking hate weeaboos.
I knew about ping guy but i never saw this channel until now. This guy is a true fucking genius.
Dear God, dear god have mercy, I just realized, what if there will be a new breed, weeaboos and bronys combined into one, weeabronys, who watch Japanese dubbed episodes of my little pony, oh my god it can happen, and the idea of it is terrifying
hmmm and what about those westaboos?
9:56 LOOK GUISE I FOUND THE REASON WHY MEGUCA IS SO FUCKN POPULAR
That song made me want to die
"I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass...ya feel me? I just wanted a piece of the Helicopters ass."
Is Legend League and anime?
Now that I have evidence to prove to others that I am not an obsessive Weeaboo, I think it is safe for me to comment here.

I totally agree with Frank here [although I'm sure I'm not the first nor the last to say that]. It's one thing to like the culture and all the things associated with it, but it's another thing to obsess over it. What I never considered up until I watched this was that this obsession can also become essentially disrespect for the culture. American society has really somewhat gone overboard with this whole "otaku culture" thing [Even I was at one point, having something called "chunibyou" or whatever they called it]. I'm not saying it's a bad thing - I'm just saying there's a point to where it gets really irritating. Almost to the point to where I can compare Weeaboos to Vegans.
The redgoomba is a weeabo
I still don't really understand if he uses his natural voice during these videos. It really sounds like it would hurt your throat to talk like that for so long.
To this video starting there was an ATT&T commercial that had weeaboos.... I mean Japs.
What anime is this¬†1:17 for research of course XD
Rosette Stone...
1:58 - I actually know some people who are like that. Thinking of disowning them.
8:47 - Is that Clark Duke?
This is funny as fuck lmfao!!!!
you forgot to add that they randomly add words like "kawaii" when talking....that crap gets on my nerves..other than that..this video is hilarious...Frank your Channel always makes my day haha XD
I am le epic meme master
your voice sounds like it hurts
i feel like puking.....ermm i dunno i just ate lunch and then watched this right after :v
but i love you frank <3
My favorite anime has to be Dead Space.
I can so see someone yelling in the middle of japan " WHERE IS THE SUBTITLES "
XD
Someone give hime the pussi already, dear lord!
A new disease has entered the realm, Five Nights At Freddies fan boys.

FRANK WE NEED YOU MORE THAN EVER!
Anime is gay.
Watashi mo halfu desu yo. Anata wa nihongo de America no joku o yuu toki ni, sugoku henna yo ni tauji mas. But even then, you're fucking awesome.
lol he really does great naruto dialogue xD
holy shit are you facebook friends with demonius
I love you , you should be gay with me
Filthy frank I need your help. My current school is crawling with weeaboos and those filthy monsters are spreading. The infection is consuming some of my close friends. HOW DO U PREVENT MYSELF FROM BEING INFECTED????
Weebs.
Papa Franku...I have a confession to make.
I was a weeaboo till my late 50s.I was collecting katanas and I was masturbating to my sweet kawaii pillow-senpai-sensei-sama-san-kun-chan.Until I heard your angelic message.I decided to change my way of life.I wanted to change myself for my familia.My drunk father used to beat me up because he found out what I was watching.My whole family split apart.Even my dog's family split apart.
But one day I knew what I had to do.I took a cap and a baseball bat and I started hitting everyone who got in my way and even my beloved drunk ass father.
Because of you Papa Franku...I ceased to be a weeaboo.
I am know a lone wolf,a gangsta and I'm hitting hard in the motherfucking hood.
I am chosen by the thing I always wanted.The motherfucking Thug Life-senpai.
wat do u think about venus angelic?
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the
¬†top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across theUSA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo
Am i a weeaboo for knowing that Tokyo is the capital of Japan?
Most of them are 9-15 too
hilarious how he put the right translation on the pigeon part but not for the two dead people in his closet in the beginning loll. This is the video that made me subscribe <33
i have a cyclone star but its for practice
anime is just cartoons and manga comic books.
nerds at my school would of slit my throat and anally raped me by now
I fucked your mother yesterday filthyfrank, but i dont believe she is your real mother, because her pussy was so tight i dont believe a baby came out from it.
4:48
I'm going to learn Japanese on Rosetta Stone for other reasons.
Anyone else feel like they have to explain themselves when someone says you're a weaboo for just liking anime? I mean, I'm passionate about what I like but fuck.
I googled wifu and now I want to kill myself. Thanks Filthy Frank.
YOU TALKIN SHIT ON ANIME!!!!????? TIME FOR CAPS LOCK!!!
fithy frank makes me moist
Am I a weaboo? ;~;
didn't even know weeaboos existed
absolutely disgusting
isn't it weird that most 10 year old anime girls have double-ds?
like that's fucked up.
WEEABOOS are fucking disgusting
What if you liked swords, katanas, etc, before even hearing about animes? xP
Behind his unique style Frank really has good points. His view on that matter is actually quite reasonable.
i just like ass.
n titties. but ass more.
plus it pisses people off so thers a small trolling potential
So true
Omg subscribed! You are spot on!
WEEABOOS 6:54 !
Anime: Where ever High School everywhere has a group of teens and their pet Monkey-Bear fight off the evil Robot Aliens from Planet X
what is wrong with your voice, sounds like strep throat or something...
WHY DID I ONLY DISCOVER THIS GUY NOW?Okay I guess I'm gonna be a fan now huh..
Frank and Greg (Onision) would get along so well. :))
Kappa
this is a great message
my favourite anime is the walking dead.
Eyyyyyyyyyyy..lmao.
Frank, I am a filthy weeaboo and I need your help. I'm trying to recover but can't seem to escape from my obsession. Please, you must start a program to rehabilitate weeaboos and you must help me. You must make a weeaboo reactionary force designed to catch and help weeaboos. I will make the ultimate sacrifice to lord Chin Chin to make this happen: my Cowboy Bebop blueray, my 10 year old DBZ action figures from childhood, and most importantly of all, I will sacrifice all the knowledge of the Japanese language that I have garnered from watching anime. And...whispers...I will go dub, not sub.
weeaboo bait//////ATTACK ON TITAN SUCKS!
my favorite anime is¬†fresh prince of bel air.
This was hilarious Frank! On point with that shit. Freaking Weeaboo's drive me insane. It's like yeah I like anime, yeah I wouldn't mind learning Japanese or visiting japan some day but bro I'm American. I speak English fluently and only English fluently.
I LOVED that irony part you talked about. How "Otaku" culture and I use the word culture very loosely is HIGHLY frowned upon in Japan. It's like DUDE! You're precious Japanese people would absolutely HATE you if you acted like you are now over there.
4:15 you should be a Voice Actor for anime Frank, that was fuckin' on point.
Filthyfrank  is down right the Martin Luther King of speeches and youtube!
ey b0ss good forneverworld impression b0ss
I noticed that when he was typing really fast on the MacBook in the beginning, there is still another MacBook in the back.
i feel so bad for his neighbors
Family guy is awesome
I IM NOT A WEEABOO GOD DAMIT I DONT CARE IF I HAVE ANIME AVATAR DA BOSSEABOSS
I'm not a weeaboo so what I love soul eater I love Japanese culture
4:34
I think he is adorable when he is ramping on about something that NOONE CARES about
why should people have like their own culture
Omg is that joji singing???
I don't understand how people watch anime and become a weaboo. I want to go to Japan for the carsüöóüí®
Needs more Cowboy Tanaka.
Best vid ever xD
I started playing Maplestory. So I named my character "WeeaboJones" xD
Bored of Frank, more Cowboy Tanaka
Thank you for your explanation, i didnt know what in god name was a weeaboo. i am very fond of anime and manga, and i am taking classes of japanese. i hope to be able to learn japanese in less than one year. i didnt know that weeaboo existed, always tought that a otaku was basically the same. always learning something new in your channel. much apreciated.
As a fan of anime I fucking despise those Dirty Worthless Weeaboos to the point that I've started gathering equipment for when the time is right, do I plan to kill them? No because a taser, pepper spray and a paintball pistol is already very effective against neckbeards of that caliber, no need to go overkill, besides it's way more fun to watch them writhe in pain from a well placed nutshot.
Man, I dont know. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a pretty good anime too.
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is the single best anime FACT
Otaku's are alright

But Weeaboos are just annoying.
How dare you Frank, I have weeaboo friends...










...Execute me.

Alright. This applies to every Fandom, Fan base, anything that has a large group of fans really. I wish more people could understand this.
(Poorly constructed, typical, probably says exactly what another comment says, comment is poorly constructed)
Hey man, chopsticks are just really efficient for eating bite sized foods, like popcorn shrimp, sushi, and pussy.

Great video. As someone who enjoys anime and is really interested in Japanese history (Meiji-era), you perfectly summarized why I don't really have anything to do with "the community", and why I avoid conventions like the plague.

holy fuck you sound sexy when you speak japanese
A little orgasm in the beginning
I have now seen every dark corner of the internet
you know (note that I have not watched the full video and I don't plan on to) if a person has a anime icon doesn't mean they're a weeaboo and just because they get really mad when someone hates on anime doesn't mean they're a weeaboo
my ears... hurt
I get this is true, but this is coming from the weirdest Japanese ever. Really, I bet most people watch your channel because your weird and crazy. Plus, you are Japanese because that is a paradox it self; therefore, you are a rare and disgusting person, so you are like a "rainbow farting unicorn" the rarest of all creatures.
10:10 is glorious the infamous cwc
Sword art online is'nt a very good anime.
bruh fucking weeaboos man fucking heavy breathing and pounding on keyboards full capslock -_-

@Bonnie le bunny ~Anime nerd~ is a weeaboo ;)
There were no black or jew jokes. I am disappointed.
So liking cartoons and being a weeaboo are two different things?
Anime=Baed
Remind me to watch your videos with headphones on.
WOOOOO!! Nobody gives a shit. 2:50. Too funny.
1:58 lmfao
6:57
So Fudging funny Im Dying! ¬†:F
What's wrong with anime avatars?
I hate anime in general. XD!! This is generally why! Like, Jesus christ, weeaboos are awful!

And people ask why I'm scared to watch anime. XD!

((Disregarding my profile pic, it's so unfortunately the only style I'm decent at... I can't draw regular humans. Just Transformers really.))
Just saying, the guy at 9:09 isn't a weeaboo since he has an english sword, he's just far.

Well fuck me in the eyeball i'm trash
I'm subscribing because of this beauty of a video
Chris Chan!!!
No lie, he looks really good for a 52 year old.
I almost started making a fedora joke to my brony/weeb friend and then before I finished my sentence she screams "OH MY GOD I LOVE FEDORAS" and I had to avoid laughing for a good 5 minutes
where have you been all my life insta sub with this vid
did he just throw a conniver's kunai
I LIKE THE VIDEO THEN I KEPT ON WATCHING AND WHEN IT ENDED I TRIED TO LIKE IT AGAIN! OH AND CAPS LOCK CUS FUCK WEEABOOBS!
swag
My fav anime is Fresh Prince
Warning, word wall and story about a weeaboo brony neckbeard thing. Read it at your own discretion.
-
One time I was at Hot Topic with my buddies, they were looking at the Doctor Who and Greenday stuff while I was looking at the badges. I wanted to get a Supernatural Badge to put on my backpack when I noticed this really fat guy looking at the anime stuff. He had a fuck ton of pimples on his face, was morbidly obese and was wearing a trilby. I ignored him and decided to take a quick look at the MLP section (I used to be a brony but it's been months since I've last watched the show or anything).
All of a sudden I hear a really heavy breathing coming from mister fedorable who had approached me from behind and asked in the most annoying voice "Do you like My Little Pony too?" I was fucking freaking out, this guy was the full stereotype, he even had a scruffy neck beard and MLP badges on his trilby.
I didn't really hate anyone back then, and I kinda thought Trilbies could look nice if they were worn right, so I said "Eh... kinda. Nice trilby by the way."
He gave me a look like I just took a shit on his mother's grave and said "It's a fedora..."
I told him "It's not a fedora. A fedora has a wider brim and doesn't go up unless you clip the brim to the bowl. That's a trilby."
Mister fedorable shrugged it off and then asked me who my favorite pony was. I had only watched the final few episodes Season 3 and read a tumblr blog so I didn't really know much of the story, so I just said "I kinda like Doctor Whooves."
All of a sudden he laughs in my face like I said something stupider than admitting to like My Little Pony. He told me "Everyone knows Fluttershy is best pony."
I really didn't care about this so I said "Yeah, whatever."
Turns out this guy was stage 10 Neck Beard and he got pissed just because I said I didn't like the pony he liked. I was just about to walk away when he grabbed my shoulder with his greasy hand (which also stained my shirt) and said "Listen, Fluttershy is best pony. You got that?"
Shit was fucking real, I was kinda worried that he was gonna do something. I swiped his hand off and turned around, saying "Dude, it's no big deal, it's just a show."
Suddenly his eyes rolled into the back of his head and the exorcist voice came out (not really) as he screamed "It's more than a show! Are you even a real brony!? You're just here to make fun of me aren't you!?"
I stepped back since this guy was way smaller than me (I'm 6'4" and had quite a bit more muscle than him) and obviously not in control of his emotions, knowing if I didn't and I had to defend myself I'd probably be the one arrested. I asked him to chill out and he just screamed at me "Don't tell me to fucking chill out!" All of a sudden he wound up to punch me, but his fist was intercepted by my buddy Eric shoving it out of the way.
Eric told Mister Fedorable to calm down and just as he was about to attack Eric I put him in a full nelson, telling an employee to get security. After holding him back for about two minutes, him flailing like an animal, a woman approached me and said "Are you bullying my son?"
I looked at the woman and then back at the trilby guy, he was in his thirties and his mom was there probably to pick him up. I explained the situation to her and she said "Oh. don't worry, he just has trouble controlling his emotions." She was able to calm him down enough for me to let him go and she took him out of the store. As security got there we explained the situation once again and my buddy Thomas who had filmed the scene with his phone after the guy started yelling at me showed the security guard the entire scene.
We were praised for handling the situation so well, the manager offered us a 10% discount for our troubles, and mall security told us we could file for assault, but we decided he already had a rough enough life.
I grabbed a Derpy wallet I saw and a Doctor Who T-shirt to change into (I really hate stained shirts), looked to Thomas and Eric, and said "If I ever end up like that guy, please kill me."
Thomas said "I can't do that, murder's sin."
I then said "That thing wasn't human. Think of it as putting a dying animal down."
Not all bronies are like that, but looking the stereotype in the face and having to detain it was possibly the weirdest thing to ever happen to me.
Personally my fav anime is Attack on Gundams.
Japanese cartoons? Wow, you uncultured swine. It's Chinese cartoons, you morons.
you def watch naruto
This channel is brilliant!
Dude Filthy Frank is my fav anime
This is autistic, luckily I am too.
Now can you tackle the ever growing problem of normies?
guhahahahahahahahahah
Get ready for the weaboos that claim to not be weaboos yet you look at their screen name and recent videos, or subs, are all Japanese weeaboo fuckboy shit
Those body pillows freak me the fuck out
5:49
FUCK ANIME...... love pokemon

"We have to run!!"
yeah... sure... that's what the safari man says...
Ore wa manko ga daisuki nanda...
yeah...
see, i was going to bitch about how you shouldn't talk bad about weeaboo's.....but i don't have a anime profile picture so, everyone would have known i was just being a troll.
What's wrong with Rosetta stone?
lolz
My favorite anime is Barney and how I met your mother
I haven't touched anime for this very reason....
EYY bitch
i thnik once i saw frank in prison raping his cellmate whit pink guy.......¬† i was the only 1 survived
Wait did he say mom when he found out he woke up his neighbors?
Well let's be honest guys we've ALL watched Corey in the house so I guess we are all a little weeaboo.
I wouldn't fuck u if my dick was on fire and ur ass was a bucket of water
I'm not a weeaboo but I know people who are and they sound just like franks description
So basically what you're saying... Is that you HATE anime and senpai will never notice me?
BTW was that Ed's pocketwatch around Jones's neck?
What about otaku? Like me? We're not as bad as weeaboo
Nerds shoot them
You should be a voice actor, Papa Franku.
Lol so true
oohh....little satly seeing Japanophile roped in with Weeaboo....
seinfeld is a good anime
I like anime, but I mainly like Japanese cars more. I plan on learning basic Hiragana and Kanji, and visit Osaka once and a while for the car culture. But thats it. I don't want to stay there or become Japanese. Plus, JDM car parts are a lot cheaper there.
Omg i love this the whole time i was just slowly claping on how i do all thoose things and laughing
Funny how a lot of weeaboos are watching this and not caring
I love this XD¬†
Never seen your videos, but you are hilarious!
No one else has the balls to go viral with this shit or let alone say it out loud.

Nice job :3
support prejudice equality LOL
Is that his real voice??

Rain you hatred on bronies next or Brits I don't know.
Switched to hentai bcz it's easier to explain...
godbless your soul
Awesome that he speaks fluent Japanese...
The subtitles are never correct.
My favorite anime is Ben10 : Omnipusi
If Jesus was a video, Here it is.
I love this, it's too funny. I love the impression you made of male anime characters when they speak XD
The REAL weaboos are the ones who get offended by stuff like this! Frank made it clear that liking anime and Japan don't make you a weaboo, and the label applies to morons who make complete asses of themselves over the internet. The same thing goes with bronies. You can find people with pony avatars all over the internet who just love to get into lengthy arguments about- fucking anything, these people literally just want attention. Is being a brony bad? No. Go ahead, that's cool.
WEEABOOS!!!
Harhar those I speak japanese and wow dats some fucked up shit you actually said aka not the subtitles.
I want to fuck an anime
I accidentally saw a weeaboo ranting about people who don't like anime and I had to come here to cleanse myself from what I saw
Filthy Frank show = best Anime
Stop deleting my comments you fucking nazi jew, go back to your trailer and fuck your step mom you fucking prerequisite afro whore
These weaboos with their gay ass profile pictures smh
Its about time someone said it.
BRUH IS HE SPAEKIN JAPANESE??
My dick smells like your forehead. Terminate your damn channel already. Giving me Ebola every second fagget.

Well I feel awkward with my anime profile picture... I'm not a weeaboo, I just really liked SAO
Damn weeaboos amiright?
From a economical perspective. It's weeaboo's that are keeping japan's economy running, after the World War II, japan's economy was messed up, and not many countries apperciated Japan. However, after many, and many years of rebuilding itself, anime came about, and it began to globalise. Swiftly, anime became known, and many people around the world were contributing to it, by donating, consuming, or even visiting japan (All these boosted japanese economy). These weeaboo's were remarklably, boosting the japanese economy (They raise awareness, consume all the products, and visit japan), meaning more so than those that just liked anime, and perhaps "just" contributed to it, by consuming.
Now imagine, if these weeaboo's were not around, japan would more or less, be in the same state as north korea (Economical wise), it wouldn't be gaining much of a attraction from the rest of the world, and wouldn't be apperciated it. To be quiete frank, Japan does not have much to offer, at least it didn't before, it was anime that boosted its economy, and gave it the right to begin branching into other stuff; boosting its economy even more.
If I was Japanase, I would be really glad, and appeciative of these "weeaboo's", though some may go far, but let's not forget it's the influence of the anime to begin with, therefore, if Japan doesn't want "these" weeaboo's around, it can do so by not making anymore anime.
I have never come across a Weeaboo, even if I did, it doesn't concern me much; as an Iranian, not many people look up to our country, though they did before. Therefore, If i had a minority group, that loved Iran, it would put a smile on my face, not give them a name, and look down on them.
My favourite anime is family guy
What about the "uwotm8 fedoras mtn dew minrecfater tr0lling xdddddddddddddddd cod muntag parodyz xdddddddddd", those are even worse...

having those pillow case and wallpaper and pretty much creepy. im pretty much into anime too, i dont see myself want to having those stuff and never will. what i have in my room is a shelf of games, 1 manga collection of Death Note, 1 katana, a SL9,G36C ,P90 and a Mauser Sr Pro Tactical, (im pretty much into Airsoft too, go out and have some fun sport war play rather than sit inside and play CS). and some drawning of my own on the wall.
weeaboos make us look bad and look like a looser cuz they're,they're creepy, they disrespect culture, being a smartass what they have no idea about, try to be what they're not, pretty much like you are in a sport team and some fat looser joine and being an asshole to sportmanship make your team reputation go bad , that's why we hate them. just stop it!

fucking chris chan, Jesus I forgot about that guy. And I'm glad I did
But....Attack on Titan is a good show...):
The only reason I like it is because it isn't even in japan nor does it have japanese school girls n shit like 95% of anime doesn.
FUCK
My favorite anime is Half Life 3
I am honestly highly offended, you can't judge our passion for anime. But I see where you're going. This stuff will never be real, don't try to make it real. You can cosplay from time to time, otherwise it's over the top....I personally love Attack on Titan and I did learn japanese from the anime but umm, well I do understand much of this. How people go too far. I got a Survey Corps jacket, no harm. Now if I purchase ODM gear, we all know it's gone too far.....but I'm still a bit offended.
Fucking hilarious, good job frank ;)
Seinfield is my favourite anime
Weeaboos, dude god damn nerds. They suck.

In Japan you get people obsessing over anything English. They even change their names to Parlour or Teacup O.O
This is the greatest video in the history of forever! This will never not be funny.
i think most weeaboos can't draw anime
my favorite anime is zack and cody

6:56 Ey Boss

Someone Give this freaking man a cookieeeeee1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what i really like about this channel that it slaps reality to anything right in the face
That eye part cracked me up
This WEEABOOS Bull crap really started to get Traction ain't it?

But ultimately this crap is basically born off the "misogynist bitches crap" and "Racist Nigger crap".

I, Dr. Dick Phuc PhD in Internet retardation will explain it to ya'll retards.

The Black Racist Nigger scenario:

The original, mainly the "Racist Nigger crap". For example. A Black Nigger interacts with a white man and or asian man. When the Black Nigger thinks that he's offended in some situations(even though it wasn't offensive at all or not about RACE at all) , He will pull out the "YOU RACIST FAGGATON" card calling anyone racist if you insult them the slightest even though its not even about race. ¬†Thats true now a days. Go to New York and see what happens specially inside the train.

In the other hand. If a Black guy calls another Black guy "Nigger", do they pull out the "YOUR RACIST" card? No. Hypocritical fucking niggers.

The misogynist Bitches scenario:

Again this is just like the "Racist Nigger crap". When a woman is some how physically harmed the person who harms them which is 110% of the time a male will be branded a misogynist and that he did crime against all women he should be shot dead like a dog.

But now adays. Even the slightest thing against women (not even physical). Like taking a picture of their sexy butt and posting it in the internet or complementing them face to face about how sexy they are (check that ugly woman wearing sexy ass yoga pants walking in NY getting harrased video bla bla). They will automatically tag you as a misogynist and that you should be shot dead bla bla.¬†

But if a Woman fucking fucks up a man beating them to death and do they get to jail? not. whilst if you beat them up back, you will for sure.

Same for the Black NIgger Bullshit. A little offensive thing and they pull out the Racist Card even though its not even about "RACE".


And now the birth of the 3rd Bullshit : The WEEABO Crap.

It is true that WEEABO exist. But to classify a WEEABO is very specific.¬†

Basically a Virgin 52 year old guy with glasses wearing unwashed shirt who dislike their own country, thinks that they are japanese, and that Japan is the best country in the world = is technically ¬†A WEEABO.

But just like the 2 other scenario with BLACK NIGGERS and FEMINIST Bitches. The WEEABO crap followed the same route.

The route to where: Just because a person uses an anime profile picture, or because he watches some anime, or he reads some manga or if they use a romaji naming apparently now MAKES them A WEEABO.¬†

So ye basically to sum it up:


You accidentally insulted a BLACK Nigger but the insult is not about RACE.  DUDE its not even about RACE = BLACK NIGGER still calls you racist.


You gave a sexy woman a compliment and that woman will get offended, Its a compliment not an insult you BITCH= Bitches calls you a misogynist


You use an anime avatar or watch some anime or read some manga <--- that is far from being a WEEABO = Retards call you a WEEABO.¬†

 But that is good ain't it? Less people read or watch manga and anime, FUNIMATION Capitalist pigs lost profit and they die. Good that is Good.


What is NEXT?


A a 52 year old guy with glasses and unwashed clothing saids "PUSI" in public and people will tag you as a PERVERT Rape Face RApist hah!.


A round of applause dipshits.

yep Internet is fu cked up.

I hope that is educational for you retards. Although since you'll are retards you prolly won't get where I am drifting at.

Sayonara Retards.


Also as a Bonus:

Anime = Cartoon = if you watch anime you watched a "Cartoon". I bet all the people on this comment section 9000% watched "Cartoon's" from your life time. Winny the POOP ? = Cartoon, Snow white and the 7 rapist = Cartoon bla bla

Ya'll are WEEABO Faggots. :P
Yay!! I love anime!! But Jesus... I'm definetley not like that about it... Freaking wannabes you've gotta be hot before you start trying to act like an anime woman :) (I'm a girl and I am NOT a lesbo but everyone knows its true)
5:05 you mean jackie chan but from japan?
I can say I am lucky enough to have never met these kinds of people prior to looking up the term. Must be a bigger city thing.

Nothing wrong with collecting knives and swords if it's purely a collection thing. Meaning you understand there is no practical use for them other than decoration. Well unless you have need to travel to a potentially hostile country. Then having a decent knife might come in handy.

I keep a very sharp switchblade on me but I highly doubt it will ever see any other use than opening candy bags and/or boxes. That is for the best though.

My favorite anime is 24
We'll my avatar is a 7 for seven dragon balls
Lol,weebs are so annoying I am Asian and the anime lovers are like "You are not Asian cause your eyes don't look like an Asian person."
What's wrong with an anime profile pic? :(
–û—Ö—É–µ–Ω–Ω–æ !
SSundee Anyone?
All this shit makes me wonder: back in the centuries there were some eras where the greatest civilizations were admired to the point of imitation. Just imagine the Roman and Hellenistic ages' "weeaboos"
dat pedo stach doe
"I want a piece of percys ass"
you are a phsyco man you are not normal go look for help!
I just realized my old friend from high school was a weeboo though I never suspected cause he was asain. He had a anime pillow with a girl and some posters in his room when I visted. I was like uh so you like anime a lot I guess. He's like yea. Never thought about it much until now. Been a while haven't seen him in the longest time.
It's hard for me to get into anime. The only two that I really enjoyed were DeathNote and Soul Eater and I can't stand those overly dramatic japanese voises that Frank impersonated in this video.
IS THAT REAL JAPANESE?
What about fuckbois
OMF THIS ALMOST KILLED ME I WAS SITTING ALONE EATING AND SALAMANDER MAN PLAYED THE RECORDER AND I ALMOST CHOKED TO DEATH WTF FRANK
This is literally my friend, Lisa. A Weaboo. ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢
"i look like a badass with my new sword" wow lol no words
This is the best thing ever
I wish there were more people like you hahaha. Crazy motherfucker.
Whenever i hear franku speak japanese im like dayam he has good japanese then im like wait fuckers japanese.
But, japan has all the video game exclusives tho!
Oh no, filthy frank. I think I know a few people that are weaboos. What should I do??? I don't want them to get killed if they go to Japan.
This channel is dirty and hopeless everyone here is dirty and faggots don't judge people who are fans of alot of stuff like anime ponys Harry potter fnaf ect. U guys should be ashamed because people are all different don't judge them
My favorite Anime is Sesame Street
I learned japanese just to play games eariler am i a weeabo
Dude ur so funny          I love u
(Not in that way tho) I ain't gay
4:33 dat part
My favorite anime is Planet Sheen.
Not sure why I'm just finding this channel but I see why people call you faggot kill yourself...Jk I love this channel because of the hilarity it brings me! Keep it up Frank!
What am I watching
PINGAS PINGAS PINGAS
Omg i died at Scrumdiddallyumptious XD!
"I have two Jews in my closet"
"They're both dead"
7:51 Conniver's Kunai?
+TVFilthyFrank¬†you're awesome :) you're a dick to weaboos but you're words are filled with wisdom¬† #filthyfriday
Damn it Frank you for got The Simpsons, and Family Guy!
The second half of this video seems like a pretentious modern art movie made by some hipster
ehhh attack on titan is a pretty good show and i just like it im not a 'disgusting ass' as he says
Braveheart was my favorite anime.William Wallace is my waifu.
My friend has an honorary japanese middle name. chan. it's dumb.
kauz you know i get all tat pussayy
{Papablum:} and it is Scrumb -diddly-Dumbcious!
^^^ yeah when he said anime fans are in every comment section he fucking means it, üòÇ
pls don't h8 me papa franku
this man is my friend ¬†.
my friend showed me this video and it is very true.. living in shinjuku, me and my friends often see "weeaboo" tourists and we don't understand why they act so disrespectful to our culture. sorry, my english isn't good
No comments were made about the nuking of Nagasaki and Hiroshima?
Thank you dirty francis. ¬†Its perfectly fine to really like something, like anime. ¬†Me, ive loved dinosaurs since i was a kid, and still love them to this day. ¬†But i dont stick plates on my back, glue horns on my face, shove a tail up my ass and go eat low-lying ferns and cycads. ¬†So why weaboos, why? ¬†Why must you creep everyone out? ¬†You are a living human, not a 2D cartoon. If i cant be a fucking t-rex, you sure as shit are not going to be a cartoon character
Turn on the subtitles :'D Dying omg
The 5 degrees
Westaboo: Japanese equivalent to Weaboo
Ameribias: Max amount of mcdonals for a week is 1 to 2 depending on the amount of depression Still favors America
Semi-Ameribias sees Americas problems, still likes it
Normal person: A person who doesn't get thier heads stuck in other cultures but do acknowledge them.
Semi-Japaniabias: prefers japan but notices its problems
Japanibias: Buys every volume of one piece thinking it will end soon
Weaboo: 47 chromosomes
I hade this friend that claims not being a weeaboo but every time anime comes out he's always hyper about it and talks about being a martial artist on a temple.üòÇKeep it up man,ur videos are always fun no matter what ur making fun of
my favorite manga is real house wives of beverly hills
wow.. people actually do that ._.
like... wtf... i like anime and shit.. but not to the point where i buy a bed and pillows that has anime pictures on them.. like.. that's fucked up.. really fucked up.
does anybody get hungry for pepperoni pizza at 10:08???
ok, the guy at ¬†9:22 you call him a loser but he has a bunch of chicks around him (yes, real ones :D )
Your voice is actually quite good (when you're not behaving like a retard :))
Willu smithu is the best anime character.
Oh my god this is the funniest thing I have even seen. I go to school with a pair of weaboos, they go around sniffing each other's shoulders and... fornicating all the time. Fucking weirdos
Thing is I know how to use katana's and shurikens and I even have a Japanese uncle but I still respect my own culture and heritage yet I STILL get called a weeaboo
Well Venus Angelic is wrong a bit there...
He said that there are two JEWISH people in his closet, not ministers or whatever.

And their dead.
Please make a video on bronies like mentioned before. Don't play nice either, be brutally honest with this disgusting obsession.
What if I bought a katana if I like the samurai culture?
Hey, you guys should check out Boku No Pico!
It's a killer anime that's for everyone!
loud and random doesn't mean funny
Brilliant!
10:20 what the hell did that weeaboo do to his or her bed ?
My avatar isn't hentai.
Fuck u why do people like u put others down where all humans and just because they are obsessed with stuff from Japan doesn't mean that you can call them a weeaboo because people listen to me wat if u where in their shoes and they said that to you wouldn't u feel bad and stop watching anime and all that stuff I'm Asian and someone my friend called me a weeaboo even if I respect Japanese culture and I'm not obsessed with anime for crying out loud you don't even know the person's life and u say weeaboo and their Japanese and stuff so don't put people down cuz wat if I said u are a dirty ass mother fucker and a bich to u, wouldn't u get offended by me saying that to u so don't judge people because of the way they are and we're all different don't take any swearing seriously plz don't ban me off of youtube
Frank, you comment towards the people not using hand signs in the corner... I'm sorry to say this, but people do that shit... they do... that shit... Went to school with a kid who would wear the headbands and dress up in the clothes from Naruto and even tried the different hairstyles... and who fucking use the hand signs, was the funniest thing to watch, I shit you not... then when he would catch you watching, he'd start swearing at you in Spanish. which only made it all that much more funny.
Oh man I thought I was a little bit of a weeaboo but oh god man iam glad I'm not a weeaboo
Q: What do weeaboos feed their spouses?
A: Wife-food.
Holly shit you are 50 or was that a joke
Lol
CSI is my favorite anime. I like it when Ash solves the crime with a childrens card game.
Sorry. But I'm a otaku
I can't stop laughing XD who else thinks date a live is the best anime?! :D
This is the funniest shit I have seen in a long time.
Those pillows are pretty common .

Im glad I have a gf to watch anime with.
Nd she knows Im in love withall sorts of anime.
But I couldn't see myself trying acted Japanese or moc it.
Instead I say " Japanese are so creative. different but in a good way " . ^-^
Oh my gosh how did I not know about this channel earlier haha Weeaboos are a very horrific, disgusting, smelly species XD
I mean, I have a Miku profile pic but it's one of my drawings so that doesn't count right TTvTT?
Holy shit he is an amazing singer!!!
I have an anime avatar. I have watched anime for over 4 years now, but have only watched a small amount of 20 series or so. I barely give a fuck for Japan or it's culture or whatever. I don't care if someone doesn't like anime or cartoons in general. Anime isn't for everyone. Anyone with half a brain should know that.

Does this make me a weaboo?
I don't see why people are defending weeaboos. It's one thing to like anime but its another to make it your life.Okay I'd be lying if I said I didn't have an anime t-shirt or 2 but at least I'm not obsessed or a 30 year old living at home.
cowboy tanaka
Weeabos are disgusting. They want everything to be anime and it makes anime corny. They think they are improving cartoons. Just go back to doing the naruto run in public
Franks...52?
Why didn't you put Edgy in the Anime category?
FilthyFrank its okay, when I was younger I thought I was a dragon because I had really bad heartburn.
It was kinda cool when frank spoke Japanese in anime style XD
[breathing intensifies]
I still want to laugh at those people that take him seriously x'D he's fucking hilarious
That answered all my questions
Made me subscribe. I still hate the japs.
i'm fucking subbed, my friends kept telling me to watch you and i finally took the time to do so, and i haven't laughed so hard, loud, and so long like this for years. holy fuck, thank you xD
MORE SHIT TALKING ON WEEABOOS!
Why does this guy sound like he's screaming when he's talking?
Is it being a weeaboo if you just watch anime (not a lot like some people do) and like drawing that art style?
Subbed.
I own katanas because some anonymous person sent me them

japanese people use so much western shit in their society, say one thing in japanese and the whole internet comes for you katana collection (/jk) all jokes aside you can like anime and the culture of japan and still not be a weaboo. There is nothing wrong with liking another nation more than your own. Why do i have to like england just cos i was born here that so fucking narrow minded
So basically an otaku who is WAY too into japan?
Cory in the house...... xD omfg
this was a weird and wonderful experience. like zebra birth and the dead finge trick.
Sore throat?
you should do a video on the really messed up parts of the homestuck fandom
If collecting weapons that can't be used then why do ppl collect stamps and shit when they can't use them too :T
What's wrong with collecting swords? I wanted a zweihander when I was younger, and I still don't see anything wrong with that. If someone wanted something like shit from FF7, then I could see what's wrong with that.
3:24 lmfao
This is what I mean when I say to people that no I'm not a freak because i like playing video games or because I like an anime show. I just like the fucking things, it doesn't mean I'm some creepy bastard kissing a pillow and fucking a master chief helmet. SERIOUSLY! though you got a sub right here man. PS that was fucking hilarious.

...and yes my name and pic are anime
He looks asian without glasses, then puts the glasses on and looks white.
hahahaha
i feel like im a weeaboo :( but i tell people im american, does that count?
A few years ago, my friend was a Brony and Weeaboo. We cured him by bullying him. He is now 18, has a job,has a girlfriend, and has a college life. He threw out all his anime and brony posters, toys, DVDs and everything. He grew up and now he admits he was a total idiot for watching a show designed for little girls (MLP) and trying to be Japanese (collecting Japanese weapons, speaking the Language, only eating food custom to Japan, etc). He now loves his life. Sometimes Bullying IS the option. There IS a cure.
fuck that pigeon
now all we need is a video about furfags
holy shit...... this guy is the best he talks so true!
they call me a weeaboo just for loving anime and manga. im not a japanese.
they love holly wood films and watch frozen 4 times. they are not american. now what should i call them??
I'm only 18 years old and already listen to Pink Guy! I thought i was born in the wrong generation till The Great Lord Chin Chin saved me from the bad internet rappers. I've always loved Balls In My Face and place my mom's set of genitals in my face while my sister puts her balls in my penis-vagina while my dad eats my ass till i cream out of my ass. After the terrifying experience of being raped by my family, i realized that Lord Chin Chin was an asshole and the only friend i've ever had was Red Dick, Trash and Jingle Balls, till Franku made them go through a Batsu Game. All i'm trying to say is, praise The Great Lord Chin Chin or you'll be sent to Jacksonville, FL.
All of you are missing the point.

The point is watch whatever you want but don't be a fag about it.

If you buy/make something from the show/movie/book/game and wear it publicly you're being a fag about it.

If you actively emulate someone/a character from the show/movie/book/game in public you're being a fag about it.
I'm a fan of anime and I want to dress up as Kirito for Halloween is that weaboo?
I'm dead üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüëçüëçüèªüëçüèºüëçüèΩüëçüèæüëçüèø
Well fuck me,I thought you were a mexican.
Filthy Frank, I just want to say you make me really moist. I want salamander man to impregnate me so I can then grow my own food.
Anime is like drugs, video games, or anything else addictive. Just don't become obsessed and overdo it.







Drugs are pretty good doe
So.. you're a weeaboo in denial?
my favorite anime is FilthyFrankShow
Lol Filthy Frank Knows Chris chan. Sonichu motherfuckers.
can you believe this guy, he pronounced the anime completely wrong in the beginning of this video.
LAWWWLLL this is too funny
You gotta watch this with subtitles
I've watched this video 3 times now.¬†

Wanna see my katana¬†collection?
Whats the anime at 1:18? never seen it.
I CANT be the only one who think that supernatural fans are the worst (especially on Ifunny)
5:49
report me to riot
My favourite namine is was Code Lyoko.
I'll be real, watching anime all these years has influenced me to prefer asian women (although I clearly know the fine line between reality and a cartoon), want to go to japan, and speak japanese, however I would never go around shouting some naruto phrases left and right and want to become japanese. Every country has their pro's and con's, so i cant really see why people would latch on to the fake ideas that people see in anime when it is make belief. Does this make me a weeb?
If you offend everybody, you offend nobody.
Something about closets and dead Jews?
Im new to filthy frank is he making his voice like that or is it his real voice
Much cringe, such weeab, gross
That lady with the yaoi stick at 10:04 scares me!
my avatar is of a video game character that is based on anime style (DOA 5) .-.
am i a weebababooey now?
i'd watch family guy rather than anime any day
I too wanted to be a Thomas when I was young.
AEROPLANE INSTRUCTION VIDEOS FROM THE 80's IS MY FAVOURITE ANIME
Had sad cum after watching this sad hentai
Im shitting right now
2 dead jews walk into a closet, sike gas chamber
I get it. I have a rusty antique sorta Chinese sword (My pride and joy, my sister brought it back from a missionary trip. :D) and a bunch of pocket knives, I like collecting them. I can't say I'd want to collect exclusively katanas and ninja weapons or whatever, but I might add some to my collection some day.

I do it right, though, I don't take edgefag pictures of me with my weapons, I just collect them to collect them and...Well, maybe use them if I'm forced to.
Does the Weeaboo apply to me? 
I love anime and I watch it almost everyday after work. I have a girlfriend and I have a social life.
Please read 9:27
there's nothing wrong with enjoying anime shows but acting like anime is everything like everyone is interested in it is stupid
i agree weeaboos are annoying and stupid
This guy is pure gold
Sincerely yours

PANDA PANDA
JOJI!!! PLZ ¬†TAKE A REST FROM FRANKU!!!! ¬†START A NORMAL VLOG, FINISH YOUR NORMAL ALBUM!!!

I really like Japan and Anime, I also went in Ninjutsu ''school'' when I was 5 (one year before I watched Anime) and well I want a japanese garden :| now I ¬†feel like a half weeaboo god damned xD
the dislikes are the YTPMV community
You know what is weird?
I can understand Japanese but can't pronounce it
skip to best part 6:55
Oddly weeaboos hair smell like bad pizza. all greasy and shit
I have ed as my avatar does that makes me such a bad person? all i want to do is be a space cowboy.
I know everything that is to known about the japan since i watched every Takashi Miike film at least five times.
this guy is a fucking hero.
This dude is fucking crazy lmfaooooo
"there is a difference between anime fans and weeabos"
tips fedora
alright I'm out boi'salso i have that frog hat...
Collecting swords and throwing stars isn't quite weeaboo, unless you are influenced to do so because of Naruto.

also if you're gonna collect katanas you may as well collect other weapons or i consider you a weeaboo (that is of course unless you have a PHD on japanese history or some shit)
"Over here at the Filthy Frank Show we support prejudice equality. Everyone gets shit." ¬† Subbed.
Whats wrong with having a katana collection?They are generally cooler looking than most other swords and make pretty good decoration.Although i dont own a katana collection,i have just 1,because im poor :(
this growly voice please stop i cant watchhhh
Fucking died at "airplane instruction videos from the 80's" XD
hahahaha you are soo hilarious :'D
Mate what would be a japanesian that watches american cartoons and collect like shotties and use plastic forks what would they be called. The fucking government is keeping this shit away from us

Where have you been my dear man. I thought I was wandering in the dark side of youtube. But if this is wrong, I don¬¥t wanna be right. I pledge my life to you
I'm so glad i changed my avatar from Finnian from black butler to me. I feel i am finally free. Thank you +TVFilthyFrank
anime is crap. Deal with it.
Mai favrit animu iz dockter hoo and sooper smas bruh

This is actually a good reality check.
XD JUST DO IT lol god this was realy funny hopefully you wont be hunted by weaboos
Got me with "the pillow standing on its own".¬† holy dick
weeaboos and bronies make gay people look ok and cool
yes Naruto (aka my anime bro) shoved a good old hidden village secret finger jutsu up my butt. 







if you dont like my comment or think its to 'weabooy' then dont comment just keep moving i dont want crap like 


1. "really? really. you mother ** peice of weaboo ** no good waste of space!" 
or
2. " oh my God you like naruto? HAHAHAHAHA NAruto sucks you weaboo!" 


or 


3. "your just like kyles mom a big fat stupid b*** jaz hands"
We all know people like this. We all secretly hate them. They secretly hate themselves.

HALLO MY NAME IS AH COWBOY TANAKA

Frank was wearing skinny jeans x3 and also you do lot look 52 you look much younger than that :3
AoT is garbage and will never be finished. Hopefully yall fannies can die faster than your trend :p
Fucking weeaboos, amirite?
You know guys, this video has taught me something. Filthy Frank takes popular topics and tells the truth about them in a comedic manner to inform us of their flaws. FILTHY FRANK MAKES US BETTER PEOPLE!
My favorite anime is Fast n the Furious Tokyo Drift.
Yeah, weeaboos are lame.
That Japanese stuff in the beginning is like ASMR
Seinfeld best anime or gtfo
Ayy lmao
You have not made fun of lamps yet
No mames carnal me cage de risa y mas por tu voz jodida animo (y) jajajaa x'D
i feel the same way about weeaboos
But seriously, fuck naruto.
In the beginning of the video where the caption says "are you ready to have some fun? I sure am!", hes actually saying that theres two dead people in his closet
Cory in the House's animation was so good.
this was fucking HIGHlarious XD
All you needed to do was go outside
I don't like anime.... Actually, I hate it... I always did... I just watch South Park...
filthyfrank has the voice of batman lol
I collect guns
well... here's an anime avatar for my picture... weeaboos are ridiculous though, i'm not one, I just watch anime. I've only watched like 5 or 6 anyway lol
Are those freckles or pimples.
Another youtuber had also addressed this topic check it out
52 years old?!!!
Im from Germany so i don't know what counts as anime anymore
I'm otaku and my friend showed me this vid and I thought it was super funny!

Two different kingdoms envelop the world of Google+.
There are people who don't know how to use the Google+. They enjoy posting things such as motivational quotes, religious quotes and other quotes. Many of them do not understand the English language, therefore they resort to plastering smiley faces all over new posts. Most of the women have millions to billions of male followers and when she posts a picture of a dog there is at least one man who says "hot!!1".
The second kingdom consists of...weeaboos. Many of them like to take the names of famous anime characters, mostly Eren Jaeger and other characters from the anime known as "Attack on Titan". Many of them enjoy posting "repost or die" pictures, "yaoi", "kawaii" pictures and many of their followers commonly enjoy posting comments such as "CUTE :3" or "OTP". We are currently undergoing research on these people to better understand them. With a donation of just ¬£3 per month, we can provide our researchers with manga to lure in the weeaboos and take them to our labs where we will cruelly experiment on them because that's definitely how our research works.
We're not doing it for fun, I promise you.
As for the first kingdom...well, it's not worth bothering with those. They don't understand what our researchers say anyway.
I lost it at the train ass. My god, thanks so much.
Anime should be banned in America. ¬†It's mostly child pornography, so it's very illegal, and no sane person would miss it.  #Banime
fucking weeaboos man
My three favorite animes are Angry Beavers, Golden Girls and Islanders Pregame Show
But I'm not a weeaboo. . . I don't even watch anime all that much.
i didn't know what a weeaboo was before i saw this video... and i've now decided to become one of them. so, yes, i think this show actually gave me cancer
I only watched one anime series, I don't talk constantly about anime, I only know how to speak English and German fluently and I cosplay rarely in public, so I think I'm good.
lmfao
...
A long time ago I used to like anime (age 15.   I'm 18 now )but  
Then I found out about weaboos...

Fucking fags take a fictional universe from a fuckin drawing and ruin it for the rest of us 

I like fighter jets and aviation
And you Don't see me putting wings on my back and  running around making engine noises....


Fuck weeabosÔªø are annoying  fags
....GO TO ANIME EXPO PAPA FRANKU #FrankforAnimeExpo #FilthyFrankAnimeHunter
Time to play the game "FIND THE WEEABOO!!!!"
I know the biggest weaboo ever
She hates her parents bc they are white and she's now white too
And she hates white ppl and just likes asian ppl and has asian friends
She is bullying non-weaboos who likes anime n stuff and says they should stop acting as if they where japanese BUT SHE CALLS HERSELF JAPANESE WHILE SHE'S AN EUROPEAN GIRL I MEAN WTF
http://steamcommunity.com/id/kuraidesu/
No help for this Weeaboo
Im pretty sure he says there are 2 dead people in his closet at the start of the video in japanese...
seductively squeals Rosetta stone
Only lord chin chin is the true god.
Welp... Just Subbed
In this comments section that should be about Weeaboos, I find it strange that non-Bronies bring up MLP and Bronies more than Bronies do.

Strange...

I don't hate any specific fandom, just those weird fucking people who collect merchandise, change their avatar, and generally just masturbate to anything related to said fandom. I don't care what shit you watch in your spare time, just don't collect merchandise and act like a faggot on the internet.
Lolz

Hello! you just hooked yourself a new sub! LOVE THIS SHT MAN
4:09 LMFAOOO
Make fun of Furries and Bronies.
... Eh, I kinda agree here. Some people get out of hand ( remember someone. Right here. Huge nerd, love anime, play video games, hate people, blah blah blah ) some people like worship Japan. Like sure I fucking love it all. They have a lot and so do we, it would. Be cool to live there. And sure it would be cool to learn Japanese. But some people need to understand where they are from and stuff. I fucking love anime and go on 4chan and stuff. But I also know who I am and where I was born and belong and what not. I don't wanna be rude either but it's the truth. Not saying it wouldn't be cool if a anime would be real, he'll yeah it would. But these people are crazy about it.
papa franku please help I have found a weeb¬†https://www.facebook.com/pages/Yuuki/1491372631096476?pnref=story the roast needs to commence!
I was a weaboo until I realized 99% of anime is generic moe crap. I still read a lot of manga though, it's good for drawing inspiration.
Ra ra ra rasengan. ..ra ra rosetta stone...
real weeaboos get pissed when you call anime "cartoons" or "chinese". if you call anime a chinese cartoon, its fun to watch them get butthurt about it.
THIS WAS TOO REAL

Favourite anime is lazy town and Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up 10 hour loop.
10/10 IGN
My friend called me a weeaboo, but according to this definition I AM NOT A WEEABOO. and to those of you who are, I respect your decision, but come on really?
I really want to know who the fuck is filming him.
Best anime is King of the hill.
So me having this profile pic makes me a weeaboo? I just like anime :|
alternative people ahahaha.....ahahaha...... don't like them hippies
King of the Hill is best anime. Dale Gribble is my waifu.
ROFLMAO
*while still keeping in touch with their own

Damn you, Urbandictionary, get it right.
I like anime, but this video made me piss myself with laughter. This channel is amazing.
Sonichu is best anime.
name 50 other good anime apart from Filthy frank and Cory in the house
The only Japanese phrase I know, and the only one I need, is "Watashi wa hentai!"
Wtf is with his voice? It's really annoying.
it sounds like speaking hurts his voice
I love how if your profile pic is an anime your instantly dubbed a weeaboo 


Dammit papa franku
every dislike is probely from a weeaboo
I just like certain animes and Japan, but that's not the main reason I wanna go there and learn the language :3

(It's just plain awesome
This is so great, dude.
To people who don't speak japanese too well and think they're good at about 0:09 seconds the subtitles aren't right.  He actually says "there are two americans in my closet"  "they're both dead"
I'm curious, is Frankk playing all these people? I can't tell
o3o
Ayyyyy YOOOOOOOOO Fuck me man Corey in the house is my favorite animu
I respect all cultures, but I think it's really important for us not to lose sight of ourselves! :)
I was 17 when I first saw this. Now I'm 32. FEEL OLD YET???????
I once saw my brother masturbate to kone from Bleach....
I like how Frank predicted how weeaboos would act xD
I can't get over this fucking video! I love this guy!
Filthy Frank speaks words of wisdom......ALL PRAISE FRANK
Wanna make fun of anime, Frank? Fuckin' go for it! Who's stopping you? (REWATCHES THE VIDEO) Oh yeah those guys
On point. Everything said. 100% on point. Subscribed :D
@ 9:58 That Weeaboo looks like Peanut Butter Gamer!
I have a 10,000$ Nazi Collection
fuckin' right on, bit ironic that a weeaboo is bitchin' about weeaboos though
This is why WWII shouldn't have started. THIS IS WHY AMERICA SHOULDN'T HAVE NUKED JAPAN.
Hi, I'm Sarah Mclachlan, Just 25 cents a day can get these pour souls the help they need.
I like his voice
I don't even like Japan. They did come up with sashimi though, so they're alright I guess.
weeaboo? more like fuck a you!!! oh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DESTROYE
D
Cory in the house is best anime
This comment is written in Japanese.
7:52 - 8:05 Hawt.
pink guy = daredevil
A point you could've made, Frank, is how most of these are all "I want to go live in Japan", and most of them can't keep a job in the western world, much less survive in Japan, who is worst than any western country when it comes to work.
was totally a guy in the end that looked like nevil longbottom
i just wanted a piece of Percy's ass
Jimmy Nuetron is my favorite anime.
Favorite video
I showed this to my friend and he said "in the beginning he said there are two white people in his closet and they are dead"
Yes, it would be nice if anime characters were real. However, they aren't and never will be so fucking get over it. Cosplay and all that shit is fine with me, but there a point where you really have to stop believing those things are real.
Im living in jaan right now and i can tell that every weaboo that comes here to a long term stay tend to be realy disapointed. You can even see the hapiness going away in their eyes
This is the best thing I've ever seen. XD
Whoa Nice, wait you're 52? you look younger but seriously Frank I Hope in Real life you're exactly like this
franku ur taste in anime is shit watch some quality anime like boku no pico
Shieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet. I am a weeaboo confirmed!
Those fucking pillows are creepy. Just... Kill it with fire or something!!
I lost my shit at Seinfeld
4:28 Dude, I shit myself at this part
How the absolute FUCK have I just discovered this channel?!?!?!
Don't talk shit about attack on titan...
i had a husbando (male equivalent of waifu) i was super obsessed with and tbh i cut myself because he isn't real. i don't now and this video made me realize i was so stupid, which is relieving. cuz i thought my life was over then..but this vid makes it look like a laughing matter hence it cheered me up and made me laugh. xD¬†

i like anime along with everything else..so i'm not a weeb. :> just someone who appreciates everything. :>
9:56 is that PBG?
At least they aren't as bad as bronies and People obsessed with Adventure time....
lol Rachel and Jun need to see this video.
I AM TYPING WITH CAPS LOCK ARGGGGGGGGG
Your videos are hilarious man, keep goin'
where mr.ando at
#kingofthehillisbestanime
Silly kids with their animus and mangoes.
What the hell the best anime is F.r.I.e.d.s
yea i fuckin hate anime too its the shittiest thing on the world
OK, this should cover me for the next 100 years.... Thumbs up if you're watching in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, 2033, 2034, 2035, 2036, 2037, 2038, 2039, 2040, 2041, 2042, 2043, 2044, 2045, 2046, 2047, 2048, 2049, 2050, 2051, 2052, 2053, 2054, 2055, 2056, 2057, 2058, 2059, 2060, 2061, 2062, 2063, 2064, 2065, 2066, 2067, 2068, 2069, 2070, 2071, 2072, 2073, 2074, 2075, 2076, 2077, 2078, 2079, 2080, 2081, 2082, 2083, 2084, 2085, 2086, 2087, 2088, 2089, 2090, 2091, 2092, 2093, 2094, 2095, 2096, 2097, 2098, 2099, 2100, 2101, 2102, 2103, 2104, 2105, 2106, 2107, 2108, 2109, 2110, 2111, 2112, 2113, 2114 or 2115
My favorite hentai is duck tales and spongebob squirtants

also lord chin chin i have sin to confess, i fap to boku no pico least 3 times
but i'm here to sacrifice my chin chin, am i going to heaven? B0$$?
my favorite anime is hannah Montana
Now Frank needs to shit on the tumblr Feminazis.
holy shit.... I think I might be a weeaboo
everyone goes through a weeaboo phase
I am a fucking faggot
Toy story is better subbed than dubbed.
Where have you been all my life
i'm surprised Frank's fluent in Japanese. Lucky
is filthy fronk part Asian?
I do have some katanas and shit in my house, but I practice kendo and iaido. Is it ok ?
Oh I forgot that now if you have touched or seen anything japan related you're a weeb.
Animes are cartoons.
Favourite anime movie: Big Hero 6 (it is in japan so it's Japanese)

Favourite anime show: Super Mario Brothers Super Show (the characters were made by Japanese people)
I wasn't even really interested in the topic of this video but it's so entertaining I'm just gonna keep watching it
This generation's anime sucks. Fuck this generation, everyone knows Charlie Chaplin movies are the best manga ever created, if you disagree you should commit sudoku. I was born in the wrong anime
Frank, do you count cosplaying as a character just in general, or because people do it poorly? I like cosplaying simply because I like the character, and I actually put the proper time into making the outfits looking good. b0ss please notice me.
So i'm an otaku and i honestly found this video to be hilarious. There are definitely people who take it too far and are annoying and defensive. Although I don't see why you have a problem with people who have anime profiles if they're not doing anything wrong...
frank almost cost me tits on omegle
HALLO. MAI NEIMU IS KAUBOI TANAKA
My favourite anime is the big bang theory

I'm gonna move to Japan, become an anime character and pretend I use to have a deep dark past, and as I look into the sky people will ask me "what's wrong Joseph?" I'll say "Nothing" and walk away. #RP
Fuck The Grand Budapest Hotel!! This video deserves that oscar more
"I Am A MLP Attention Faggot And I Am A Gay Fucktard Who Should Kill Myself."

5:41 AAAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Breathing intensifies













Don't kill me
not like ending theme song
I hate to say it but the ending song is catchy
when he was speaking Japanese "ready to have some fun?" "I sure am"¬†he actually said " I have to people in my closet, and there both dead"
Waifu coming to lifeu
Lmao, this guy is hilarous! I like anime, but that's pretty much it. Weeabos can be pretty annoying, I agree :)
How is this guy not a Japanese speaking voice actor??? He needs to be on the next seinfeld
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!! ALL CAP RAGE!!! MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT THIS BRONY BULLSHIT!!
The filthy frank show is like a windows computer from the 90s. Louder than other models and really fucking hard to explain to your parents.
Does anyone else notice when Safari man speaks, it's not what in the subtitles but instead it's "I like pussy" xDD
It's like when Chin Chin or Salamander man speaks
Nice try Franku ;)
Jerry-kun so kawaii.¬†Addendum: But Costanza-chan is best girl
In the beginning, he's saying how he has dead things in his closet.
–£–µ–±–æ–∫
Ohhhh!!!! 9:00 the pillow he is lying on is so cool! It's Maria from Boku wa tomodachi ga sukunai!
Oh i can totally approve that, happens to often.
4:48

I'm crying
My favourite anime movie is Fight Club and my favourite anime show is probably Game of Thrones.

My favorite anime is probably The Suite Life of Zack and Cody
1:02 turn on captions.....its quite interesting
OMG. WHEN HE DID THOSE NOISES HE WOKE UP HIS NEIGHBORS
This video has been out for half of a year, and that picture of the weeaboo sasuke impersonator with the hooter's chicks still makes me cringe... I literately have to look away or put my face into my hand cause the raw sensation of embarrassment.
5:00

Huh... Interesting.

I remember some statistics saying that Poles are number one in being MOST unstrustful people on earth. Add really hard Polish language to that - hell, it's probably as hard, if not harder from Japanese.

That would explain why also Poles are xenophobic as fuck.
SO.......Hikimori otaku...........don't apply?
Do one on scooter fags XD
I was forced to take 1/2 a term of Japanese :\
I learned fluent Polish from watching Corey in the House so you need to watch your crap.
Is frank a weeaboo he speaks jap own loads of theere is shit from Japan
I watch anime and read manga... Am i a ass?
Filthy Frank should do a video on furries/bronies
i agree "Weeboos" are kind of annoying but anime is cool
Hah, laughed my ass off xd
An anime pic doesn't make someone a weeb there actions do, always remember this guys. Also Breaking Bad>Anime.
Touhou and Hatsune Miku is my favorite anime, Frank just doesn't understand.
I collect weapons and know Japanese but anime is gay as balls
MAKE A WHOLE VID IN JAPANESE!
+Officer Cheeseburger of The UTTP¬†Look.
the exact problem with large amounts of people who watch anime I myself watch anime, however I don't fucking worship Japan nor try learn Japanese from it, just sometimes gets stuck in my head but I don't even say it like you got these people with borderline Pedophilia pictures of girls from anime and its like: what the actual fuck, the character is like 13 and your 40 and live in your mum's basement I myself am 15, so doesn't apply, still don't get all of that shit though
Anime sucks
Can I just say that you're fucking amazing at being amazing?  I haven't laughed this a hard in a very VERY long time.
Ty franku, i didnt know what weeaboo is. Now i know and i proudly decided to call myself weeaboo <3
My favorite anime is Friends.
6:29 Love the false translations <3 :')
wtf did I just watched?
|keep in mind im a wight american boy| I think i'm a veitnamese imagrant
"just because you dress and act like a certain ethnic group, doesn't mean you're that ethnic group"
Ha! Try telling that To eminem and his fans
*That Moment Whenn You Don't Know What You Are*
Guys! Quick question! 
Sinefield vs Cory In The House. Which is the better anime?
My favorite animes are Full House and Cory in the House
how old is frank?
The truth has been spoken.
I guess I never really fully comprehend that someone else has to film this stuff
I used to have a friend that would hang out with his autistic friends. His name is Euegene and he's Korean. At lunch he would play magic the gathering so much and all he would talk about was Attack on Titan. I told him his life is Virgin Simulator because all he does is play Magic The Gathering and watches attack on titan and plays with paper airplanes at school. ¬†Notice how I put *used to have a friend.
Turning Japanese,
I think I'm turning Japanese,
I really think so.

Oh wait...
...I hate anime.
'Murica, fuck yeah. Why own a Katana when I could own a fucking Kukri?
Weapons
DID ANYONE NOTICE THAT THERE ARE A BUNCH OF HATERS BECAUSE THEY ARE WEEABOOS AND THE INTERNET IS FULL OF WEEABOOS? THEY SHOULD GO BACK TO FUCKING THEIR BODY PILLOWS. AND AOT SUCKS
You are my senpai 
My only senpai 
You give me dokis

Youll never notice me 
But i still love you
Youre so sugoi, kawaii desu ne!Ôªø
          - trash weeaboo 2015
Omg if you turn on subtitles its amazing.
Du esst Die Landkarte.
I like Anime not because it's Japanise, but because it's good. If it's not good, I don't like it, whether it's Japanise, American, French or whatever.
if anyone actually says otaku in a non ironic way 100% weeaboo ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
Fire at will.
I'm new to this channel. Please tell me if thats his real voice (if he has a condition or its normal) or he is just doing this for the video. Either way its still pretty cool.
This is the most hilarious video I've seen a long time!
Help me, I'm a scottishboo. I watch scottish movies and cartoons, dress kilts, play bagpipes, drink whiskey and gin, I'm learning Gaelic on rosseta stone and I have an collection of claymores on my house. What I do?
i really fucking like the voice e makes when he speaks japanese
Love this guy :D
on that day, mankind received a grim reminder. We lived in fear of the weeaboos and were disgraced to live in these cages we called facebook walls
Would i be a weeaboo if i bought a sword from sword art online? lol
I lost it at "Rosetta Stone"

Please notice me B0ss
that voice!
he is 52?
I admit I used to have a katana collection...but I also had a Claymoure, greatsword, a Roman Gladius, a Pakistani curved blade that I cannot remember the name of, and quite alot of other weapons......I lost a bunch of stuff when I got robbed... and Im 17(I was 14 when my stuff got stolen).... I like weapons... blood...hehehe

I really like anime, and admit I like some hentai....

I want to go to Japan and see all of their cultural stuff, but Im a little more obssessed with Roma, Graeci,and Scotts-Eire culture.... Im mainly just a history NUT.

My favourite anime is actually a game.... Anyone ever heard of Corpse Party?

And to end this message I will respond to all the things Filthy Frank mentioned by quoting James Bond from Octopussy:
"I fear, my friend, that that is only the tip of the tentacle."


Would I count as a Weeaboo?
Weeaboos in my school be like "o mi gash attack on titan is meh life don't talk shit you idiot baka stupid"
Yeah dude anime kids be like "meme meme meme meme senpai more memes" and I be all "....."
ur vids make me laugh
filthy frank u make mi life w0rth living
How do you get by all the weird looks people give you on the street?

Also, Family Guy is shit.
JAJAJAJAJAJ RASENGAAAN!!!
watching anime doesn't make you a weeaboo...
he speaking french in a mongolian accent
This was a little more informative than FOX News. 7/10
Lol people with anime profile pictures are so fucking stupid what a bunch of fegs
FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS SON
Jews are disgusting.
I was attacked by a f*cking weeaboo just because I complained about an anime characters hair....like seriously WTF
I was looking forward to see the two dead ministers in your closet which you mentioned in the beginning of your vid tho...XDD
GUILTYYYYYY ;D
JAPPER FAPPER JAPPER FAPPER!!!
Shut the f*ck up Attack on Titan is a good show.
This is brilliant.
A lot of asses in these comments aren't understanding correctly. It is ok to like Anime, but don't be attracted to Japan like a pedophile is attracted to little boys.
Flango
notice me Senpi ^.^ Frank-u-chan ¬†>///<
i love saying things like SAO is bad to anime fans and watch them break down XD
Jimmy Neutron is probably the most underrated anime of all time
Lol I'm the only guy without an anime profile pic
So what if a person is not even a quarter ASIAN (and self proclaims to have blood of a bunch of other groups) but insists on emulating Japanese culture and its Anime subculture only to the extent of (poorly) learning the language, trying to be a "kawaii girl" for a year, and having locked themselves with a friend in that friend's room for a month, without bathing and mainly eating junkfood, to watch crap tons of anime? Are they a weeaboo?
My favorite anime is Full House.
i learnt what a weaboo is because of this video! thank papu franku!
WEEABOO REPORTING IN
I've watched to of your videos and it was funny , your an epic guy , your pretty smart in describing people commenting on your videos but some times you pass the limit of this is not funny anyomore , you have a talent in describing people actions you use it to hurt them and it sometimes piss off people you have a bad comment on everything hip hop , instgram (that's the videos that I saw ) its like you live to hurt this people its like you feed on it soo pls think before you say anyword it may not hurt you but it may hurt other √¨am saying this cause I saw a lot of people moving and doing shit  , your a good guy and your smart you can figure out how to pull yourself up and if you  really planning to change put this comment in your videos (if you want to) and see if the crowd agrees then change then If not I need to change my way of thinking of people.
Great. the white girls found filthy frank. WELCOME TO TUMBLR, FRANK!
1 hour till Mewtwo
Forget weeaboos, the worst fan base is religion
You should play the next batman!
Cory In The House is the best anime.
I want cloud's buster sword so badly!
I needed this channel. I really, really needed this.
I immediately suscribed, never seen your channel but I couldn't stop laughing 27 seconds in. Made my day! Fuckin weaboos and your rugrat fetishes xD
"When I was younger I wanted to be thomas the tank engine"

Weeaboo: "ANIME IS THE GREATEST THING TO EVER GRAZE HUMANITY!"

Anime Fan: Anime belongs in the trash.
what do you call a Japanese weaboo?
"TEBURAKUCHIN"
„Çπ„Éû„Éõ„Åß„Ç¢„Éã„É°„ÇíË¶ã„Çã„Å™„Çâ "Êâã„Éñ„É©„Åè„ÉÅ„É≥"(^_^)
ANIME watch TEBURAKUCHIN
seinfeld is a rly good anime I agree completely
Honestly, it's not just 'Weaboos', 'Bronies' or whoever you think is annoying that are the worst, every fandom is the worst. I'm a FNAF fan & Pegasister (Brony) and I've seen horrible people in my fandoms. Every fandom has dumbass 9 year olds tbh.
My favorite anime movie was Schindler's List. ¬†It was very moving.
The weaboo song scarred me for life.
R.I.P the comment section
Earthquake the japs. Race war now.
Franks real voice is sexy as fuck
FILTHY FRANK IS LIKE THE SPACEDICKS OF YOUTUBE
I will never understand why I hate Anime, yet I¬†like shit Devil may cry, street fighter onimusha metal gear rising.
LOL, wow, this has to be my favorite video of yours so far.¬† I love hearing you speak Japanese by the way.¬† It's been so long since my family moved from Japan to the US I haven't heard it spoken normally in a long time.¬† It's refreshing.
Yeah, changing your Avatar to Hentai is sooooo disgusting, fuck that shit.

Oh, wait.
The walking dead is the best anime hands down
This guy has the raunchiest voice
Totally agree! I think I saw several at the Cherry Blossom Festival...
I hardly collect Anime and Manga anymore cause some of it is expensive as shit.¬†
Yeah...I'm no Weeaboo. XD
WUT
Now what if you aren't Japanese but yet you are still Asian?

what does kioa mean
this video made me print up a picture of an anime girl and put it in a frame on my bedside table and call it waifu just to be ironic...
8:45 LOOOOL
Can anybody explain me the "corey in the house is an anime" joke.
Ahh. So this is where Cory in the House came from.
My favorite anime is VEGETALES
Filthy Frank has cured 42069 people of weeabooalgia, we are getting closer to the rest of the weeaboos out there! send this to all of your weeaboo infected people, they must be cleansed of this disease!
Seeing that this is Frank's most popular video, he should keep boosting his popularity by making fun of anime in general (like how he did in the 'Filthy Frank: Anime Hunter' scene during the Chin Chin sacrifice announcement). Maybe he can make a short series of vids making fun of certain animes. Especially the mainstream animes, like Dragonball, Naruto, One Piece, Fairy Tale, etc. He'll probably be one of the most hated people on youtube, but being negatively popular is still considered being popular. And I'm pretty sure Frank's goal is to become negatively popular.
YOU ARE THE STUPIDEST YOUTUBER I'VE EVER SEEN
"There are two Jewish people in my closet. They're both dead." The fuck Frank?

For real though, Family Guy is a great anime.
Yeah, I thought I hated anime (what with the underage girl fanservice) but actually just entered my anime "stage" I guess. I really got into Ergo Proxy, Serial Experiments Lain, Ghost in the Shell, Spirited Away, and Akira. I also like some Japanese games like Shadow of the Colossus.

I do listen to a bit of music from those animes but I also listen to way more English, French, Norweigan, Spanish, and American music. Plus most of the tv and movies I watch are American or English, although if you told me about an interesting French film or something I'd watch it, I just don't know of any.

I suppose the difference is if you watch anime, or anything really, not due to its quality, but rather, the culture of origin, which is a pretty stupid idea honestly. If anything I'm a Romeaboo because they were pretty rad yo.
LOL MY ACCOUNT MAKES PERFECT SENSE
He says something like 2 guys in my closet, they are both dead, not are you ready to have fun, I was rolfing
Filthy Frank is my waifu.
haha glad to know you share the same, bizarre sense of humour as me. i find instruction videos from the 80s to be quite entertaining. Fabio's probably my favourite 1980s unintentional comedian
fnaf death minigames best anime in the life
Dr Phil is my favourite anime
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
yeah...i hate weebos. Ive been studying japanese for a year now and have loved japan and its people. My love didnt come from anime and all this bullshit that a lot of people do. Be gone weebo
How do I watch anime without people calling me a weeaboo ?
so many weaboos in the comments
Okay I know that no one is going to reply seriously but am I a Weeaboo if I have one collectable sword, a bunch of posters and manga, like pocky and ramen, am sometimes am asshole and know a little bit of Japanese. OH AND COSPLAY..I have 1 set.
,,Weeaboo goes in Japan and be like:

WHERE THE FUCK ARE SUBTITLES?"

Why I am not subscribed to you yet?
@Dark Jedi 1. Bronies
2. Weeaboos 
3. Fnaf fans (not a bad game, shitty ass community)

Also. Where are PC elitists, console elitists, offended people (aka proud tumblrists) feminazis and fedora warriors?

I never thought Sherlock Holmes, Potter, Supernatural, Adv. Time and the others' community is really bad. Of course there are annoying fanboys on every community.
"I just wanted a piece of percy's ass" Lmao
I lost my shit at Corey in the house üòÇ
;-;
man you are so funny XD
4:08 - 4:20 I'm pretty sure that Japanese is only spoken that way in stage play and acting in order to get into character and to emphasize emotion in the characters.¬†

When you think about it, english in acting does the same thing; we don't always stutter our words when were upset or use southern accents. (japan screws this one up constantly).
i tried learning Japanese gave up and learned German instead. still watch anime though.
asians can't hustle stfu
I just like anime.
Yeahhhh

I like Watamote cause it shows what anime otakus and crap are really like.

Fukkkkin weird and not sociable. Poor Tomoko.
Whats hiraganda
I like Japan, I like anime, I am attempting to learn Japanese.¬† Despite this probably making me a "weeaboo", I have mad respect for you.
How is this so accurate. I myself definitely enjoy anime in my free time, but some people take it to a whole new level
If you're a weeb like me at least be a little ironic about it
i fell asleep watching pink guy stir fry and then my mom came in to check on me and the door opening woke me up in the middle of a nightmare and i screamed pink guy cause she was wearing a pink nightgown and i was listening to him stir fry on repeat and she was like wtf put ur ipad away and go to bed and i was like ay b0ss fak u

You do those impressions pretty fuckin well 0.o
You look like that Zeitgeist guy Peter Joseph.

Yo, looking at the shitstorm that is the Youtube comments section, I'd just like to say that having an Anime profile pic doesn't really make you a weeaboo. As said in the video, you can like Anime and w/e but not be a fucking cancerous piece of shit that is a weeaboo. You can have an Anime profile pic and still have a thing called sanity.
Chris Chan is in this video..
My favorite anime is arthur.
my favorite anime is the Jerry Springer¬†show and Dr. Phil
Lost is at Cory In the House.
Fuuuuckkk your voice is literally nauseating
Wait. Isn't Family Guy an anime?
lost my shit at 2:47
Yea, I don't say I'm japanese to ANY extent. I just like the culture for how kind and such it is. I don't even understand how the flying fuck people learn japanese from anime. I take a class for it, and when a friend and I are watching something he'll sometimes ask me if that word means something instead of just assuming and pronouncing it wrong. 

Honestly, thanks for the correction Frank.
*looks at profile photo*I see my problem
Weeaboos don't realize that the word Anime translates to english word Animation, meaning Frank is kinda right when he listed his favorite Animes as Toy Story and Airplane Instruction Videos, as long as they're animated. They should really try to learn the language through an actual effective method instead of Subtitles and Rosetta Stone.

2:46 music ?
cory has been my anime crush since 4ever. BEST ANIME EVER.
huehuehuehuehue
if u put its subtitles on its filthy frank mother f###er it will say yet still the break father parker did spill the press yes
Lmfao xD this is so funny. I miss the Original Thomas and Friends show. It was more fun to watch. Sigh what happened all those awesome tv shows that use to come on. For example. Danny Phantom,  Martin mystery, Syber 6, Case Closed ect. T^T they where good shows. Now all you see on Tv is kids shows that dont really teach anything. Dont get me wrong there are shows out there that are fun to watch and teach kids. It just you dont come by them often.
"Wha wha where are the subtitles!?" Rofl.
My favorite anime is everybody loves Raymond.
Vyuj
I ate about 10 hard boiled eggs yesterday and right now I am shitting and it smells like hard boiled eggs.
Nani the fuck did you just fucking iimasu about watashi, you chiisai bitch desuka? Watashi‚Äôll have anata know that watashi graduated top of my class in Nihongo 3, and watashi‚Äôve been involved in iroirona Nihongo tutoring sessions, and watashi have over sanbyaku perfect test scores. Watashi am trained in kanji, and watashi is the top letter writer in all of southern California. Anata are nothing to watashi but just another weaboo. Watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has never been mimasu‚Äôd before on this continent, mark watashino fucking words. Anata thinks anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto? Omou again, fucker. As we hanashimasu, watashi am contacting watashino secret netto of otakus across the USA, and anatano IP is being traced right now so you better junbishimasu for the ame, ujimushi. The ame that korosu‚Äôs the pathetic chiisai thing anata calls anatano life. You‚Äôre fucking shinimashita‚Äôd, akachan.
gibe da pusi b0ss
My favorite animes are South Park, Star Wars, Spectacular Spiderman. :P
How not to sound like a weeaboo: speak basic words and try not to speak sentences
YES FRANK YOU KNOW, YOU ARE AWAKE, YOU ARE THE OBNLY PERSON WHO I KNOW THAT REALIZES THIS INSTEAD OF CALLING THEM 11 YEAR OLD FANGIRLS THERE ACTUALL ANME IS THE WEEABOO, THANK YOU GOOD SIR
I agree with several of your point ,but i think people are way to quick to bash people as filthy weabos. Me for example i barely watch anime, but I'm interested in real Japanese culture i been study Japanese more than 2 years now. I want to become an esl teacher and i sorta kinda of an teacher already i tutor about 10 highschool and college student already. I still love america it an amazing country but unlike many redneck hick here i have an open mind to the rest of the world.
I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass you feel me
Talk about Kool-Aid
Wait is he actually Japanese
Tfw I have to learn Japanese because I bought an import that I can't fucking understand
human centipede is the anime series of all time
The proudest moment of my life is when I realized Frank really said that the two people in his closet (yudai is jew?) are dead. I never watch anime, but I decided to take Japanese as my elective. Has worked wonders in the field of robotics though.
Wait, does my picture mean I am a weeaboo?
My favorite anime is star wars
I made my profile picture an anime character because of this video.
"I've had so much sex with my body pillow it stands on it's own now."
Andy's sides launching in T- 10 seconds.
hahahahahahahahahahahahaha oh wow how high where you when you came up with this????
5:58 B0SS WHAT'S THE SONG???
tbh anime is total trash
Filthy Frank is a nice anime
1:18
Can't remember which anime it's from ;w;
What the fuck is Rosetta Stone?
Frank, am I a weeaboo?

I watched Ghost In The Shell once.

Then I blew fifty Asians in a restroom.
This video ain't kawaii desu
This is funny as hell
Weeaboos happen because while the western culture is suppressed and called 'racist' if there is any cultural pride - the eastern cultures are allowed to thrive.
I really hate weeaboos for the fact that they don't know shit about the culture or history and all their sorces of information are animes. How lonely could someone be to think that a pillow is like a real person and No. Just because you watch your shitty anime that is with 5 year olds that have breast implants in japanese using subtitles doesn't mean that you can say you know japanese. Grow up you horny no lifers.
CORY IN THE HOUSE
has an anime profile pic .... wait so am I a weeaboo, or do I just really plainly like anime x'D
Wtf did I just watch
why does he talk like that...lel btw is he japans
you're my favorite anime
you filthy faggot
i love you
You make us all look bad sir. My husband would never be as rude as you. To think I live in the same country as you.
When he kicks the pigeon out and says "this is my house" what is he saying in japanese? I can only make out "kore wa"
Is that his real voice?
Okay i get these people are everywhere but just because they have an anime avatar doesnt mean they are weeaboos. I have an anime avatar on steam and skype but i dont act like a weeaboo. Other then that funny video
Filthy Frank gave me cancer, but it's okay.
my favorite anime is bob's burgers
I can learn japanese and watch naruto without being a weaboo right?
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Seinfeld was a true breakthrough in anime because it brought anime to a western mainstream audience. Even if the animation looks dated now, I still respect that show for what it was back then. If you are a anime fan and never heard of it, you might give it a go to see some truely classic episodes.
Ra... Ras... Ra...Rasegan.. Ras.. Rosette stone... Best part
My best friend has a wakizashi
Can't handle all these Toonaboos yo.Trying to resist the Great artistic Wave known as Anime.
i wonder how i feels to be him
yelling at nothing and making those sounds
Your good man. Keep on makin these videos!
I watch anime and my attractive gf watches a little anime she says the weaboos at our school make her ashamed to watch it. I feel the same way. Thank you for this amazing video.
not gonna lie weaboo jones is fucking scary
Weeaboos are even worse than hipsters. If only the government would revoke their human rights and let us hunt them. If you agree with me, find an anime convention and suicide bomb it! Allahu snackbar!
I just watched anime I dont cherish it just like the nerds in my class
I'm an old-school Otaku who started watching anime back when it was a cult fandom in the early 1990s¬†here in the states, and I've seen some pretty scary shit out of today's creeper-Weeaboo contingent. These people need help....bad!
ICarly is such a underrated anime should check it out.
literally the only FULL anime i have ever watched was dragonball z, just starting to watch deathnote...
I love this guy

I find it funny how people think he's actually 52
Weeaboo: Do not talk shit about Touhou!
Me: Shut the fuck up!
OMG

Cory in the house is my fav. anime too
but just because someone you know is an anime fan doesn't make them a weeaboo.
There are¬†1,104 weeaboos that hate this videos accuracy
i have a question. ok i like to insert jap words into my sentances. i learned¬†most my jap words from anime.¬†i have a japanese weapon. i watch anime everyday. i have an anime t shirt that i wear once a month on average. i would literaly pick death over giving up anime. i like hentai.¬†i have a waifu and her name is konoka konoe. i get really pissed when bakas say crap about anime. i like japan better then america and i would like to visit japan. i dont have a job yet.¬†i dont think of myself as american. but i dont consider myself a jap i repeat i "DO NOT" consider my self to be a japanese person. am i still a wiaabu even though i dont call myself japanese?
Cory in the house is such an overrated anime. I'd say my favorite anime is Oprah
Most weaboo people are bi sexual and they fuckin disgust me
Is it bad that this video makes me want to watch Anime
best anime:Las aventuras del ¬†Pidio Valdes
Otaku's unite!
Www-whu where's the subtitles? O.o
This is in the anime category on my recommendations.. lol
My favourite anime is Malcolm in the middle
and incase you want to not be japanese but live there have a japanese gf love anime (just a sidenote) would that be considered a weeaboo then?
My favourite anime is The Adventures Of Jimmy Neutron.

Please anybody! What is the music/song played in the Weaboo Protection Chamber?!
First of all i'm not fat and I don't breathe heavily and I don't smell bad or am I unhygienic. And I can speak Japanese pretty well, but I do realize that Japanese people don't have big eyes and I know that Japan won't look like what they do in Anime. My favorite Anime is Kuroshitsuji. I know i'm no where near being near to speaking complete Japanese.

I'm sorry if this offended anyone in any way i'm just saying my thoughts.
Think I'm gunna die of laughter cause this is just pure brilliance.
Furries, Bronies, people who go to star wars movie premier's dressed up as storm troopers, Weeaboo's, all of these people are weird, but are they really hurting anyone?
awesome!
My favourite anime is Dora the explorer. That shit is deep.
The best anime of all time was obviously Pac-man and the ghostly adventures. I just have no idea why the hell they cut it.
Hey Man I respect all your opinions on anime, Im not a weeaboo but i watch a little anime and you are hilarious, I watch Hentai tho :3 XD
....
Are you classified as a weaboo if you have Pokemon plushes at your desk
I don't see the appeal of Japanese cartoons, obviously from my profile I liked Pokemon back in the day (What a fucking Weeb I am), and Studio Ghibli's works and a few of the better done movies and series like Ghost in the Shell, Akira and Attack on Titan (Only because AoT isn't based in a Japanese inspired setting) but most modern ones are complete ass, Western Cartoons are so much better: Ren and Stimpy, the Bruce Timm Batman series', Iron Giant, The Moomin, Rocco's Modern Life, the traditional Disney movies and stuff like the Triplets of Belville.

I think its mainly down to how poor the diversity in character design is, all girls look about 8 but have C-DD's for some reason and the men look like the girls without the huge chests and just with pointer hair...

I dunno.

Blargh...
My favorite anime is Black Hawk Down
Beautiful
Omg.. I think i was just diagnosed as a weeaboo..
goddamnit this video is mocking me. whenever im on douchebagchocolat's channel i see this video in the suggestions. just fucking staring at me, reminding me that my friends hate me
is that a kagawa jersey?
"a little hentai on the down low"
"a little"
*cough
HEHEHHEEHEEHEEE LMAO REALLY..... SHit I bet Im a weeaboo arn't I... FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
does no one else recognize that he says he has to dead jews in closet
breathes heavily OMG THIS IS VIDEO IS SO ABOUT THOSE "OTHER" PEOPLE. (‚âß‚àá‚â¶)

"Don't talk shit about Attack on Titan, its a really good show."
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I love anime. I do want to go to Japan someday. I am legit learning Japanese on rosetta stone. And I am only interested in Japanese girls. And I have a katanana. Welp it looks like all the signs point to weeaboo. Time for me to just accept this.
... I actually did take five weeks of Japanese on Rosetta stone.

Then again fuck anime I was learning that shit because I wanted to teach English in a foreign country and I was learning Chinese and Korean.¬†

Also fuck teaching English in a different country.
Well shit. My Profile pic is from a Anime. But am I exempt since I actually am Japanese? Well American Japanese is the proper term. Ancestory from Japan though.
OMFG Papa Franku the moment you said "Sex invertebrates" and then started listing your favourite anime I couldn't stop laughing and fell off the bed
rip headphone users
How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?
weeaboos and otakus disgust me
HIT LIST
-WEABOOS
-BRONIES
-FURRIES
-JEWS
WTF lool
Weeaboos are the reason that hitler invaded poland.
Changed my pic to a pokemon just to comment on this
KAWAII DESU!
Heavy breathing intensifies
Hey has anyone seen The Last Samurai? Remember when Tom Cruise turned into a weeaboo?
What's a Japanese trying to be american and learn their culture?
This video just attracted a lot more Weeaboos.
My favourite anime is He-Man and my favourite anime film is Space Jam.
hey frank. dude i thought this was hilarious! i myself like anime, but i was wondering if you could make another video about weabos( pardon spelling) like this. it would be really funny to watch. thanks and keep it up!
The worst kind of weeaboos are the ones that get into massive arguments about how subtitled anime is better than dubbed anime. I really don't care, I just want to watch cartoons.
My mother came in when i was watching this. Had to turn over to porn because it is easyer to explain.
Fav Slice of Life anime? Sam and Cat
Why is it that you're not much more famous? Your videos are plain genius, but I never heard of you until today, where I found your channel just by chance. I'll send this vid to some weeb friends of mine for sure, perhaps that'll give them an idea of their current state :p
I see that cheeky stack of arizona cans in the background-Sadboys
I'm not event going to dignify this utter tripe with an intellectual retort. Good day to you sir.
Gomenasai, my name is Ken-Sama. I understand your disdain for weeaboos because they truly do not understand what it means to be Japanese. It requires dedication.

I‚Äôm a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)

I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.

I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%

When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!

I own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.

Wish me luck in Japan!
when you said you get so much pussy you said it like a gay guy.
I've been interested in Japanese culture for a long time and I wanted to learn to speak Japanese for the lulz...now I'm worried.
So today, I rode my bike to a local park only tO SEE TWO PIECES OF WEEB TRASH COSPLAYING AS BLACK BUTLER CHARACTERS AND I NOPED OUT OF ThAT PARK SO FUCKING FAST
Oh. My God! I've been stalking Youtube for a new favorite hilarious series to watch, and I've found this gem! Where has it been?!
FUCK YOU FUCKIN' WEEABOOS DOWN IN THE COMMENTS
MY FAVORITE ANIME IS JAY JAY THE JETPLANE
I...I kinda uhh...Ummm....

JUDGE JUDY IS BEST WIFU!!!
Okay, I'll Come clean. I'm a Weeaboo. I Speak Ricelandic, watch Cory in the House, and I have a couple of Long swords in my basement. I want a reality check.
Thank you FLITHY FRANK for making fun of WEEABOS!!!!
I live in austraila so I have no culture other than fighting housos with sandals so I would rather be a weeb
anima sucks dick'
HALERIOUS!
dem animes do
i love your voice...
Geez I like anime but I hate people who call themselves otakus without knowing what it actually means. When I ask them what it means they say "oh it is just a person who likes anime right?" 

facepalm
"Give me the booty."
lmao¬† "where's the subtitles?"¬† xDD
I get that some people collect weapons from different places of the world. But who wouldn't want to have a fucking weapon that is one of the sharpest swords in the world. At least ONE katana OK?
But arent all Americans cowboys
Weeaboos be like: I speak fluent JapaneseÔºÅ
Me: Ok. 
 „Çà„ÅÜ„Åì„ÅùÔºÅÂßã„ÇÅ„Åæ„Åó„Å¶Ôºü

If we could all step out of ourselves and Look in and look ate everyone and everything, it ALL Becomes quite Comical.¬† The World is Kinda Hilarious don't you think?
Haha! NOW PREJUDICE EQUALITY, THAT is a a FANTASTIC CONCEPT!!!
Our Governments would ADvance, Together, at such a Clean and Positive nature if We can Laugh at OUrselves AND Everyone else. This doesnt mean to set out to hurt, But simply means Less Extremist Feeling picked on Wussies. TOO PHUKKING POLITICALLY CORRECT that we denounce our own and inadvertently Make all others Handicapped. If you will? LIKE a **WORLDLY ROAST!**
One of my Best friends Ace Williams (R.I.P Brotha) I'll never forget when were driving and talkin some shit then he said to me " You know how Y'all Look alike" I laughed so hard I spit a McD's Sausage biscuit thru my nose. Perfect! all along knowing I dont care to look like ANYONE Else unless you can drum up Visions of Every HairBand Dork pulled from the 1980's. Haha! (joke at myself) (^-^).
My Family ,rather my brother, Likes to tell people that I am Chinese or think I am. Haha! ÂìàÂìàÔºÅÁâõÈÄºÔºÅÁâõÁå´ÔºÅ he does this because I have so much Asian aesthetics around my home. d (^ - ^) b
Its ALL Good! we need not be so sensitive! and Teach our Children to NOT BE SO SENSITIVE whilst Also BE Compassionate to others (don't set out to hurt and don't be hurt if someone is trying to flip it on you)

Filthy Frank is ruining my life. Everytime I have a drink with my mates now, I start shouting these verses about penisses in 'Japanese'. 

Ore wa ochinchin ga daisuki nandayo
Fuck gg i hurt so much
I'm a Brony. You can start talking shit now.
what was that about your closet?¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
you have absolutely no idea what your talking about. first of all not all anime enthusiests look crappy. im an anime enthusiest and i look semi normal and there was a kid in my class who liked anime and he looked normal. i dont have bad hygene. im a frieking hygene maniac i had a flip out once just because my hair got a tiny bit messed up. i even put cologne on before i go to bed every night. that like the opposite of what you think is a weeaboo. and i dont do nothing with my life. i go to college and i go out skateboarding and im trying to learn guitar. i dont try to learn japanese from rosetta stone. anime is way better then dumb family guy and reality tv. anime has so much drama and everything is just so dramatized and coriographed in such a beutiful way. its just like an opera except without the singing and dancing.and at least anime shows you tits sometimes. pussy american producers are too pussy to show tits on family guy and other shows. and anime also isnt so pussyish that it wont show explicit violence. yea american producers fear limits put not japanese. they say screw you limits were going to make this as offensive to elderly people and parents with young children as much as we want unlike you pussy americans. and at least anime has a meanigful story with drama where as reality shows are just people getting drunk and doing daily things. i mean come on thats firetrucking boring. if you want to see something about real life then go outside but if you want something¬†more revitalising then try anime. your a peice of crap and you better hope you dont see me because i trained myself to do kerate with anime. yea thats one thing anime can do that dumb american shows cant you shittard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Judge Judy is my favorite anime
Oh god this, XD. I haven't met a weeaboo in my friend circle...wait, there might be a few...oh well...weeaboos, still a better love story than twilight.... I'm dying right now XD. 10/10 IGN
My favorite anime is Parks and Recreation

Only japanese people understands The first part.

Anyone know whats worse than a weeaboo? in my opinion those bronys who collect MLP toys and there like 32, also they fap to MLP porn aswell.
My favorite anime is cory in the house.
I swear, Bear in the Big Blue house is such an underrated anime. Cory in the house is sooooo Mainstream
I'm not a weeaboo, I do like anime but I don't call myself Japanese and don't have any interests in learning the language, except for Anata seik≈ç

I always forget to breath watching this video LOL!
What the fuck.
Lol I got called a weeb and invited to a bunch of anime groups for having an anime avatar on my steam profile.

 I just like the art style..
The best part is, I know a weeaboo in real life, he wears the EXACT SAME clothes every day and has worn them since 6th grade, smells like he literally hasnt showered in 16 weeks, and if I say shit about anime calls me a "pleb" and talks about how Japan is so much better than the US and how he's gonna move there when he's older so he can escape this realm of stupidity and western filth. I referred him to this video and was met with In-School-Suspension for bullying. Fuckin weeaboos.
Me and my friend met this girl in class and we asked her if she watches anime and she said yeah I watch the Simpsons
why the fuck would anybody want to be japanese
Wich one  is  worst weaboos or mlg players?
Why did the Jew cross the road?
To pick up a penny.
What did the Jew do with the penny?
Nothing, he was shot to death for accidentally escaping Auschwitz.
putin is best weaboo
I just realized I look like a weaboo xDDDDD But I drew this picture like 3 years ago, a character from a shitty story I made up. Im not obsessed okay. I have many otherrrr interests. xD Lets just say I dodged a bullet. :)
LOL OMG

"I just wanted some of Percy's ass."

I think when he was speaking japanese he said he murdered his two friends in the back

DESU KAWAII SENPAI-KUUUN
I watch some anime but there was a group of kids at my school that were just...Uuuuuuugh.They talked about nothing else besides anime like the world revolved around Japan and would even bring bento boxes to school and attempt 9it was a poor one at that) to speak japanese.

Damn b0ss, you just earned yourself a black subscriber, that's some once in a life time shit 'cus.
Adhd much? XD
My favorite anime was shrek
I do think he forgot to include the people who are "gonna make their own manga" even though they're American.
this video was in the suggested song of a matty b call me maybe video I needed this video to heal me from the ass cancerous mattyb(itch)raps
That's So Raven was a really cool anime back in the days
If any of you weeaboo fucks think that Everybody Hates Chris is the worst anime get your shit checked.
filthyfrank ( 10/10 IGN )
My fiance is a weeaboo. Where did I go wrong? ;-;
Am i a weeaboo if i listen to dj AniMe

I was laughing through this entire video. Thank you so much frank! You are hilarious!

Frank youreno t even japanes e like what the fuck you mispronounced fucking saiyonara at the end fucking dea d givea wway.
Hi there my name is human and I am Sathire :3
Why'd you make fun of blacks and jews? seems pretty dangerous.. just heared you mentioning that. trust me, weeaboos must be made fun of, they're weak pussies. unlike blacks... and jews.. they're the people you wouldn't want to mess with..
I hate weeaboos. I don't conisder myself a weeaboo, I'm actually Japanese for real, well almost. I will be when I live in Japan though. Right now I'm studying japanese, japanese history and I'm following Bushido, the way of the warrior. This is why I hate weeaboos that know 5 words in japanese and use them all the time, kawaai baka DESU NE MOTHERFUCKER. I'm actually trying to become Japanese for real unlike all these faker wees. FUCK YOU WEEABOOS
How does his normal voice sound like? Does he always sound like this? Kudos. Funny af
Shrek is the best anime by far. Fuck all you Frozen fans. Shrek is the original anime.
This is either bad satire or he is a complete asshat and deserves to be "fucked up" by anime people. I think he's just lonely and sad.
wtf? i think he said he have 2 dead jewish(not sure) in his closet.... probably not cuz i suck at japanese.
MY FAVORITE ANIME IS VOCALOID!
Holy... He's 52 yrs old? 0.o¬†

Franku looked like 35-ish in my book!
Thomas the Tank Engine was my favorite animes.
Rip old Japan

Tenno Heika Banzai!
Whelp, time to change my entire account
Cheers is my fav anime of all time!!! The story and animation was great. Classic anime wasn't as overrated as today's anime. Another classic was friends, i recommended it
People who spend all their time dissing on people who have different likings and opinions are more annoying than any fandom. I thought we were all nerds here. Funny video though.
I think that suite life of zack and cody is a completely over rated anime
The Big Bang Theory best anime pls
The slideshow of weeaboos at the end really fucking scared me.
Yeah, I like those chinese cartoons occasionally...
i found this guy through Pictophile. every one on pict hates WEEABOO's
I like¬†anime¬†and would like to learn Japanese does that make me a Weeaboo? :(
Prejudice equality... xD
do you have a knife in your throat?
Pfft. Dr. Phil is obviously the best anime.
damn it, i have a katana.
I actually want to learn Japanese so I'm gonna lean Japanese the correct way! Bit torrent  Rosetta Stone!
So what does it make me if I only enjoy the anime I watch and occasionally roleplay as some characters from let's say Soul Eater? Honestly I don't give a shit who Frank insults whether it be Blacks, Jews or Anime. Am I like...inbetween the lines or what?
Finally someone has the courage to take on Weeaboos!
I am literally the scum of the internet. Hetalian, Brony and I love anime c: I am proud of what fandoms I am in. Hell yes- I am a fucking weeaboo but who cares!? I love Japanese culture, I totally want to visit Japan, I speak a small amount of Japanese (They actually gave compulsory Japanese classes at my school so this may or may not apply) and I love anime! :P But I'm not a fat, sweaty slob that makes love to a body pillow every night (I actually don't own one....) C:
My favorite anime is Pornhub.
My favorite Anime is HowToBasics
I posted that i hate anime on some anime and it was weeaboos all day
"Weeaboo" is actually referring to an old wordfilter for "wapanese" that wa sput once on 4chan to actually make fun of people who kept using the word on an anime imageboard. It actually means a non-Japanese Japanese supremacist is anything. It doesn't even sound pleasant linguistically.

Also, "otaku", even if it is usually implied with a negative tone in Japan, WORDS CAN CHANGE MEANING BASED ON CULTURE. Example: Try saying you want to "bum a fag" in the UK vs. America.
Wow m8
bro im fuqin cyberian and im japanese and like anime and fap to subtitles and smoke 420 but fuq my country niqqa i love lapan because fuq it
What's your favorite anime? Answer with replies. Mine would probably have to be Judge Joe Brown. 7/10 It's ok

Anime is gay
"These people with anime avatars are everwhere" damn right we are.
Seeing people actually living this lifestyle of a "weeaboo" makes me depressed as hell.
So fucking funny  my favourite anime is real life it normal shit so stick you're shit up you're ass
ugh.. good thing I don't use anime avatars.. otherwise I would have to consider myself as a weeaboo... but analogously using any sort of avatar makes me fgt. So I'm BreakingBadBOO, MemeBOO, WolfOfWallstreetBOO and gamerBOO at the same time.. fuck.
Also bronies be like "yeah, fuck those weeaboos"

This was fucking great
Malcolm in the Middle was a classic anime
Y U no let hato b ur homie
Shit, filtfran is finally making it big.   Hhmmmm

Best animes are the Hindenburg Disaster and Doctor Who Season 8
Oh, and Katanas don't have to be for anime only. Deadpool has dual katanas and he's fucking awesome.
Theres so many weeaboos in the comments PLEASE HELP THEY DESTORYED CORY IN THE HOUSE FOR ME.
Hi
Are the japanese actually that xenophobic?
Can someone tell me that music he listens to at 6:05
I am now changing my profile pic to hentai just for u
So I can just watch anime and not be a weeaboo cause I don't wanna be one
Honestly, I'm kinda worried if I'm beginning to slip into that dark place, I bought 5 volumes of the attack on titan manga on my own free will
Then again, I haven't read them in a while.
Oh the shame... Can't be arsed to change my account tho :(
Only reason I want a katana is because swords are cool. I'M NOT A WEEABOO
I wonder if this so called group Akatsuki are considered weeaboos, well they decided to take over clans in a video game and force everyone to roleplay yaoi , yuri, and Naruto. ( which I hate Naruto)
i love anime. and „Å°„Çì„Å°„Çì
lol
you should be a seiyuu
Is it just me, or did he sound like Jontron when he said rosetta stone
I almost died from laughing xD
I wanna place bombs in the covers on manga to eradicate the weeaboo's and purify this world. Who's with me?
U should speak more japanese <3
"Everyone gets shit"

Paused the video at 3:12 to look at the comments and confirm.
He's wrong.
The best part of this is when the pigeon lands on the window
I notice you always wear the same clothing
+Shinji Ikari This is his best video as of yet in my opinion. Feast up.
Weaboos be like:
It's not being a weaboo; it's having Chunibyo.
Harro, my namu is couboyu tanaka-desu

(Hey, Filthy Frank, whats the worst part of a weeaboo?)
1044 people are weeaboos get it i'm fucking funny nigger
My favorite anime was full house, but now its my favorite hentai.
If love to see a Japanese person dress up as a stereotypical American
I'm Japanese, I was born there and both of my parents are full Japanese. But I really like america, I mean, I'm obsessed. I even learned English and I'm planning on moving there when I turn 18. So, does that make me an Americaboo or something?!
Rosetta stone
My favorite anime is Spongebob
XD lmfao this is so true!
Everything in here: Both true and hilarious!! XD
Okay I took down my previous comments,
I got scared of Weeaboo Jones.
im japaneese so i know that you killed those 2 guys in your closet. FUCK YOU IM WHITE TOO
I love Initial D <3
My favorite anime is sesame street üëç
I know how you feel frankie, I too wanted to become thomas the tank engine :((
My favorite anime is Cory In The House. That shit gr8 yo
+TVFilthyFrank¬† what do you bet that all of the dislikes for the video are weeaboos?
Its amazing how good the weeaboo song is. Musical genius.
i like the japanese culture, yet i don't practice it. i speak little japanese and pronounce it well. my friends call me a weeaboo and i'm like, dafuq bruh?
We support prejudice equality. Everyone gets shit.
but what are the people called that are japanese and do this stuff?
I Just Like Anime...
who is "yourself from the future?"
Your shit is weirder than any anime I've ever seen. Love it.
Weeaboos have ruined just about anything anime-related for me. ._. Even things as simple as cosplaying as an anime character or having an anime icon are fairly hard for me to do now without being called a weeaboo at least once. -.-
This was so hard to masturbate to.
what kind of fool?
0:23 nice voice crack bud.
is this intentionally culturally offensive and inaccurate for comedic purposes, or is it just intrinsically meant to be offensive out of hate with the use of dark humor? frank makes it hard to tell the difference
This. Is the folly of
Life
But Melon Pan is great, I'd gay for it.
Wait this nigga is 52
He has dead jews in his closet xD
Only japanese idiots like you are inappropriate pieces of crap
Cory In The House is my favorite too xddddd
He has dead people in his closet...? The subtitles don't match what he's saying...
filthy frank your a fucking god lol
Favourite animes:
Family Guy
"I'm a fucken hustler" Bl
Actually using a katana is not difficult those days.  few centuries ago chances were anyone who youd meet on the street could also be armed with a rapier or a sabre (or any other blade), but those days all you have to do is move the blade tip from a high altitude to a low altitude while colliding with a part of the person who you despise (preferably the face). 
In the worst case scenario you have to use the wujushumushuschuszu powers to deflect the enemy bullets and laser beams with energy rays n other tough shit. Kappa.
THIS VIDEO MADE ME WANT TO CLEAR MY THROAT SO BAD AND WHEN I DID IT MADE ME MAD THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE HIS VOICE CLEAR.
WHAT IS WEEABOO JONES HUGGLING IN HIS STOMACH PANT POUCH???
I dont like anime
When I found out my son watched those damned Chinese cartoons, I had to slap the faggot out of him.
ugh who even has an anime avatar
Weeaboos did 9/11
1,030 people are Weaboos
your funnier than jimmy fallon
Oh my god, this is the best fucking channel ever. Why couldn't this channel be in my life sooner?
I hate weeaboos. I don't conisder myself a weeaboo, I'm actually Japanese for real, well almost. I will be when I live in Japan though. Right now I'm studying japanese, japanese history and I'm following Bushido, the way of the warrior. This is why I hate weeaboos that know 5 words in japanese and use them all the time, kawaai baka DESU NE MOTHERFUCKER. I'm actually trying to become Japanese for real unlike all these faker wees. FUCK YOU WEEABOOS

So my question is, how good are my chances of becoming Japanese for real?
52 year old man? wow! You rock Filthy Frank!!!

(sorry i'm new)
roSETTA STONE
What if you have a katana to slice things? It's the best weapon for slicing, it can cut through 3 pigs.
"a little hentai on the down-low" rofl XD
I feel like a disgusting weaboo, I watched Naruto and One Piece, franku-senpai, help me seppuku
I like anime but I hate weeaboos. Its the one downside to everything, also 5:00 thats a westaboo.
OMG!!! You do look like Tanaka Naoki LOL!!!!!! 1:46
http://www.tofugu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/tanaka-naoki.jpg
No, your example is shit, because a Japanese swangin' a lasso and threatening to shoot injuns with his lariat would be an hilarious sight, whereas weeaboos suck in every context.
I couldn't finish the video because of the way you were scream talking.
um dont talk shit about attack on titty ok
You seriously don't look 52!
This is my favorite video about cultural appropriation.
My favorite anime is louis ck
Anime sucks.
Change weaboos to bronies, anime to MLP, hentai to clop/rule34 and you'll get absolutely the same picture. All fandoms are the same - divided into people who likes stuff and idiots with strata of trolls and artistic persons. Nuff said, I guess.

P.S. I like MLP and cartoon horses in general, but I hate most of bronies.
I just found your channel today, and I've never been more sexually attracted towards another guy.
This is so me....the fuck you say about AoT!
lol, this was the first video i ever saw from him. need some explanation.
"...And being a self-righteous faggot, literally everywhere on the internet, it's not gonna help."

Just because someone is fat and they cosplay, doesn't make them a weeb. That's just really mean. Anyone can cosplay no matter what shape and size they are. Skinny people cosplay to Con too, does it make them a weeb?
I like japanese porn. What does that make me.
Sad ass collection of failed abortions at the end. Especially Chris-chan.

I do like anime, and i watch et. But, i'm iento videgames soh baye
Lots of Japanese guys like cowboy shit and they tend to be really nice people, just saying.
Can someone translate 4:19 ?
It's really familiar for some reason.
What's worse than Weeaboos? Bronies...
it featured pictures of the¬†+King Of Lightning¬†and Toriko. thats awesome lol
It's so fucking sad that when frank battled the weeaboo the only things I saw flying through the air were only naruto related, i'm I the only one that things that the dragonball series shits on naruto?

I mean I wouldn't of minded seeing a kamehameha in there...just me?
I think in terms of this. I think cosplay at conventions is the limit. Any more like Pillows or Katanas and you are dumb
I¬¥m new here.. Is he half japanese? He kinda looks like one.
JEL OVO JAROSLAV NA 2:26 ?
Lol if you were born in a different country but your ancestors had at least 50% of another country then you should be aloud to live in both countries but if you weren't it should still be ok to visit a different country for like a month or a week. But if you are a westerner American who was mostly European descent and American born maybe you shouldn't be all obsessed with being Japanese and should just face reality. I'm Dutch descent but I was born in Australia. Which is why I'm hoping to get a citizenship in the Netherlands and perhaps study there and work with my favourite game company but that's just all hopes and dreams lol. But yeh if your not even at least 50% Japanese you should give up
Fucking weeaboos üòÇ

Back when I was 14, I had a horrifying revelation. That videogames from Japan were slowly turning me into a huge weeaboo. Luckily, there was some sort of hiccup in the Japanese gaming industry, and I broke free.

I still occasionally have disturbing mental episodes every time I see a body pillow.

Shudder
.........Isn't Kage Bunshin no Jutsu the Shadow Clone Jutsu yet no shadow clones appear and he's using Sharigans?? You're getting a little mixed up there friend ^~^

Actually i got me katanas but they are from kill bill and thats one of my favorite movies. Also they just look cool...
0:23 Crack bigger than my ass
The Biggest Loser USA best anime
well, to be fair, anime avatars don't tend to be that bad.
i've got one on some sites, because i like the character (no waifu btw), but i wouldn't even consider anime among my top 10 interests.
Why do I keep watching these stupid fucking videos?

Holy fuck Corey in the house! That was Ravens bro right?
CORY IN THE HOUSE: BEST ANIME EVER.
Good thing I'm not a weeaboo.
My favourite anime is spongebob
ah fuck,fair enough,I guess we(eaboos) deserved it
lmfao after getting called a weeaboo once i started looking around so apparently haveing a anime avatar Picture is all that is needed to be classed has one
then again it might be fun to fool people who are into the steriotypes "weeaboos" enough to get a laugh or two
U got my sub
Am I a weeb if I'm Chinese and love the Japanese culture,try to learn japanese and have a waifu ;-;
truuuuu
I watch attack on titan, but I don't go "OMG ATTTTACK OON TIIITNAAN AI LOVE ATTTAKC OJ TITNNAN" Also, what is a waifu?
Will this lead down a bad path? 
I have a strange attraction to japanese girls, and even though I've had it before I started watching anime, it's growing and I'm getting scared that it's pulling me towards weabooism. Should I disconnect myself from anything japanese until it subsides?
You made me fucking cry. I've never laughed this hard in my entire life.
I almost dieded watching this video
Just because you have a anime avatar doesn't make you a weaboo... That's like saying anyone with a woman in their avatar is a stalker/pervert
Was he actually saying anything in japanese or just saying random anime shit? Or is he an immigrant or something
Make a video about yaoi, please. Would be hilarious. :D
I swear every time Weeaboo Jones says "Rosetta Stone" I fucking die laughing. xD I don't know why.
You should do a video on emos
hhahahahha " I've had so much sex with my body pillow that its stands on its own know " ohhh am fucking dying now hahahah
WHERE HAS THIS CHANNEL BEEN ALL MY LIFE?

Whoa, is he really 52?
But I just started casually learning Japanese in my spare time...
This made my day haha :')
anime is for Mexicans
Hey dude I just discovered your channel you're actally really funny and plus I can relate to this video so much. Because I have this friend who keeps watching anime and believes that he can speak Japanese from just watching it, and you don't know how annoying it gets if we came across a Japanese person he keeps saying japanese words trying to make sentences and the Japanese person just gives him the awkward smile and gets away and after the person is gone he shows off with how he mastered the Japanese language just by watching anime he even adds it as a language in freakin CV. And the funny thing is that he's from Somalia and he's not that good in Somali, Arabic( which is important In Somalia and he sucks balls at English.
I am actually japanese so... but I'm not into all that "waifu" crap or all that body pillow shit.
"Where are the subtitles?" 
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Do you actually speak Japanese or was that just rehearsal and random words?
I was crying laughing for the entirety of this video
Is this all the same person? xD
I still do not understand why he hates them. Because they like something he does not like. He is so mature
Weeabo's , FNAF, Minecraft . The most annoying fandoms ever.

At 10:00 is that bakugan or however you spell it? What a pleb weeaboo
I just found out that on every plane to japan there are 2 weaboos soon enough they will move to japan and get there hentai waifus the apocalypse is coming!
My friend has a 7 year old son that (HUGE airquotes here) "knows Japanese" and "learned it from watching Godzilla movies" and "can't read the subtitles" so he's fooled his parents into thinking he can't read and knows Japanese so he can get special treatment. And he thinks everything on the internet and in his imagination is real (either that or he can't tell the difference between imagination or reality), including Five Nights at Freddy's, Godzilla, and a whole bunch of other shit that he either makes up or imagines that isn't real. He keeps bring up this "Godzilla 25" thing that has all the monsters, and all the cam-pu-tor games, and all the made up shit in his head that he refuses to think isn't real. Even if you're 7, you still need to know the difference between imagination and reality.

I am a weeaboo. I recently thought about buying a katana, but then i realised that they are very expensive and useless as shit. Also i have an anime profile pic. Unfortunately I'm not fat and i have not a single poster or manga or anything like that. Maybe my situation isn't that bad... But then again i thought about buying a katana...
My favourite anime is russian road rage videos.
oh shit i have avatar from anime, time to change it.
5:10
This is probably the funniest thing I've seen in a while :D
I'm learning Japanese on Rosetta Stone so I am basically Japanese now! hahahah
Oh boi,my favourite animu is courage the cowardly dog and the walking dead :D
RASENGAN!
Is 1:19 even a show? or just an anime pic he found lol
The anime profiles are the worse.
Fat and gay autistic weaboos
This show is by far the best anime series I've seen so far. I've just ordered my Pink guy love pillow and couldn't be happier. Fuck haters.
So if you Japanese isnt it impossible to be a weeaboo?
I watch anime and read manga in the past, I even had a couple Shonen jump. I however never tried to denounce my own culture, nor do I own a collection of Japanese themed items.
Weeaboos are creepy...
Seinfeld is such an underrated anime that it makes me want to stick a needle in my foot and kick a wall.
This video made me moist. Don't know why, but deal with it.







Hmmmmmmm, So moist.
I almost turned into a weeaboo. Thanks 4 showering the way, Frank. :D
This is soooo trueeee omg,people always think i'm a weeaboo just because i watch anime,i can't speak japanese and i know it,i really like anime,but i still like to play games (not anime games i'm not that into turn-based combat) like halo,dishonored and gow,anime is not ALL of my life,it takes a part of it,but seriously people should realize not everyone is like this,i'm tired of people thinking i am just because i watch it
suprized he hasnt done anything about bronies yet lol
My favorite anime is Jaden Smith¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Like if you're watching in 2002
That's So Raven is obviously the best anime.
Papa franku has cleansed me









My payment is my virginity. Come franku, my butthole is all lubed up.... <3~
Cory In The House is my favourite anime.
My favourite anime is Avatar the Last Airbender.
I watch FMA Brotherhood and cosplay as Havoc, does that make me a weeaboo?
Omg this was to funny XD
This video and the comment section sums up Tumblr for me.
Took me a couple videos, but I get you.¬† You aight.
Holy fuck! I had a kid in my freshman health class that practiced "Jutsus" in the classroom with a Naruto headband! xD Good to know how I could have classified him. Frank you fucking rock man!
Got the full pink guy album :)
Stop watching chinese cartoons, guys. Derp.
I like anime, I watch it a lot. I found this video hysterical. I had trouble breathing throughout most of it. To have a body pillow and a large collection of hentai/anime porn is already over the top. It's alright to have a poster or two of a good anime. But to have naked chicks plastered all over your room is over top.
Please FRANKU I NEED YOUR CHROMOSOMES
yea srsly franks right . hungy nigwurs tryn tew be azn sew they can be better at league of legends piss me off ... nigwur ~desu
Your voice sounds like someone punched you right in your vocal chords.
ha ha ha this is so funn- ..... wait.... If people who learn Japanese through anime are WEEABOOS.... what does that make White boys who learn how to be gangster through rap music? ¬†MY GOD.
Man you really crack me up XDDD
Well I like anime I speak Japanese and I don't make a fool of myself so I guess I'm fine
Dude anime is so shitty
4:34
I like anime, but weeaboos man. They fucking suck. This was funny and so true
My favorite classic anime has to be Parks and Recreation, and Malcom in The Middle
No no dude, you can't just let the world know about these weebs, gotta just put links and pics off 4chan let em learn on their own
I like to watch an anime once in a while, but these people are just fucking ugh. Especially that one guy that made a fucking story behind a photoshopped pic of him and his "girlfriend"
topkek
Oh my god I fuckin lost it at 4:09, especially because those were actually pretty accurate impersonations
anime belongs in the trashh
Jesus, watching that slide-show during the weaboo song made a piece of me die
3:23
I was scrolling down the comments and I heard that sounds...I though he's fapping lol.
Honestly even the weird bronies are more tolerable than weaboos.
To define weird bronies I mean, the ones that fap to ponies and recreationally read clopfics, and THEN ADVERTISE THIS.¬†
Yeah, still better than weaboos.
this is guy deserves more subs!
I want to say thanks, literally I get the ''Shit ripped out of me'' at school by people calling me a Weeaboo just because I watch anime on the odd ocassion, but this video has practically said fuck off! So thanks :D
At 0:09 he says "there are two Jews in my closet. They're both dead."
You taught me well sensei b0us
Why are you alltime screaming :D
Is that an ASUS EeePad i see in the background ?
Im new to filthy frank and I must admit, eating is pretty deadly while watching the vids
Favorite anime is still ratatuille
He's not, seriously, 52 years old, is he?
man i hate those nerds with anime pics
come to my channel and hear my friends say NYESSSSS
981 butthurt weeaboos chopsticks assholes full of katanas in seir pusi. :v
Alright before i comment you are already looking at my profile pic. and typing weeaboo heavily breathing while pounding the keyboard full on CAPS now i made my message lets see how many are gonna be here screaming WEEABOO
AM CRY I AM SO HAPPY FAVORITE VIDEO IN THIS SHITHOLE
Finally a video that speaks my similar opinion
When he said people don't talk like This at 4:15 that reminded me of Kim Jon un from te interview
The guy at 8:51 has a fucking Mitsudomoe poster.

Oh boy.
cancer
>wanting percy's ass
Bitch please, everyone knows best waifu is Duck.
I see the appeal for anime, I sometimes watch it too. I mean seriously: Gone are the days of Power Puff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory, Samurai Jack, & Symbiotic Titan so the option is to watch actually entertaining ¬†cartoons from another country, or sit through this modern bullshit like Uncle Grandpa, Teen Titans Go! and Clarence (I kinda like Steven Universe tho).

Besides, a lot of the shows I (and probably most of us here) watched in my 'Saturday Morning Cartoon' childhood were anime, such as DBZ, classic Pokemon & Yu-Gi-Oh, Naruto (but only like the first 5 seasons before it got crazy and unwatchable), and anything on Toonami. Even American cartoons that were done in the style of anime were fucking bombastic. I'm talking about Avatar: The Last Airbender & Legend of Korra, along with the original Teen Titans, hell, even some of the other DC Cartoons (usually the Batman ones) were in anime style and fun to watch. So go ahead and watch anime, have fun, just remember the thin line you tread, and be careful not to fall over the edge, into the Wild Unknown - into the Weaboo territory.

With all that being said, I wonder if there are any cringe videos of Japanese people reacting to weaboos, or weaboos actually going to japan and making a fool of themselves in the most xenophobic country ever.

P.S. My favorite anime is Spongebob Shippuden
Your japanese is sexy b0ss
This guy must be hate Anime alot... #LOL
Herrro my name is pico san
When you listed your favorite animes, I had to subscribe right then and there.

Do a vid on bronies
What if I am asian, like anime, love weapons, take tae kwon do, take Gumdo(korean sword martial art, or the Korean version of kendo), and actually own weapons ranging from pocket knives to katanas to tasers? What am I then? Btw all of this is true,i do take all these martial arts and I do love weapons.
Aot part funny as hell
I got a katana thats all
Sexy voice at the beginning :)
Umm seems like I'm on the weird part of youtube.... I'll take my leave
Something that a lot of weeaboos disregard is that Japan has the highest SUICIDE ratings out of ANY COUNTRY EVER. Yes, worse than the US.
this video was in my recommended videos....
papafranku... please make a guide to finding the realm in which you have been born to??? i have traveled many chromosomes in hope of finding my family.
This is the best vid I've ever seen.Fuck those weeaboos.
my favorite anime is barny and dora the explorer
Honestly, my favorite anime is Spongeknob Squarenuts, an underrated classic if you ask me.
Live and let live!
Who are you trying to channel? Christian Bale?
Shootouts to CWC
/sasuke at hooters tho/
Hi. I like anime. I'm not a weeaboo, because it's just one out of many different hobbies I have. But you're going to call me a weeaboo anyways, so go ahead.
japenese aint like that , i like anime but i am not weeaboo
Chris Chan?
So many fucking weaboos in the comments section.
11:08 bows "Sayoo nara bastards I'm out." - The words of a legend R.I.P. filly frank
Anime sucks
weeaboos are delicious

they remind me of cheesepuffs.
perhaps chin chin will enjoy them as well?
So does that make me a weeabo ? Cuz im like watching and reading manga .. and i kinda have 3 posters and a anime stuff toy .. but  i dont want to go to japan just for anime .. and i dont dress like a that ..
Love your videos but I seriously think you need help
Fucking weeaboos...shame of Japan
we should destroy china, because their cartoons has been a poison for a generations
lol what stage of lung cancer are you at?
Why isn't this under the education category?

Did you guys watch the new Cory in the house?Cory defeats the huge ass shrek johnny test
I was a weeaboo when I was 8. I'm almost 12 now so I know so much better.
I don't know what the hell I just watched, but it was some scary ass shit.
I shaved my neck-beard before it grew too long after I saw this video.
Nope.
Can someone explain to me what did I just saw?
AAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I LAUGHED SO HARD AT THIS! wish I knew about you before! Subscribed! ;)
This video never gets old.
Weeab0ss
Rosetta Stone.
I think pokemen anime is better that that naked giant show
1:27 what did he say?
this is beautiful xD
I'm close to evolving into a weeaboo
halp.
my favorite anime is pornhub
After all this, I..uhh still don't know how one classifies as weeaboo. :P one of those photos looked like he was just showing off his new addition to his weapon collection or something. I mean I'm not experienced. I only recently started watching anime. So pardon me.
Get fucked Breathing really heavy
It sounds like he smoked while deep throating 5 dicks jeebus
My friend, not joking, was literally wearing a Sailor Moon tiara and screaming out in Japanese. In science class. It was the most fucking annoying thing.
I like Japan because war crimes are fucking hilarious.
Out of all these fandoms, which one do you people consider the WORST?:
Weeaboos
Furries
Sonic Fans
Bronies
Homestuck fans
Whovians
Harry Potter fans
Five Nights at Freddy's fans
Sherlock fans
Supernatural fans
Adventure Time fans
My favorite anime is probably The Bill Cosby Show.

PS, Frank, apparently some weeb trash made a response video to this. You should see it; I have a feeling that it's magical and full of bullshit.
im not a weeaboo. i am japanese, i enjoy the culture, like anime, and have been learning japanese for 3 years but live in america. weeaboos aren't bad people, they just assume that anime is all of the culture. it is not. so just to put it out there: people can like japan and still not be called a weeaboo- thanks
Why would I fuck Franku Senpai up?

Oh yea.
I have an anime avatar...

HECK U FRAN K U R A BIG JERK (mom sed i culd say that wurd once a month this was my 2 time dont tel her pleez) DONT TALK CRUD ON ANEMAY.

I would love to be Filthy Frank's neighbor. Like srsly id appreciate the godly material being made right next to my room.

Filthy Frank is the only anime for me.
ATACK ON TITAN SUX
Weeaboos are more annoying than eminem fans. That's saying something.
senpai i luv ur japanese but u dont have thos ebig eyes but i like tentacles so is ok
You're not funny.
Anime = cartoons
I love the anime tom and jerry
HAHAHA, U gotta be kiding me, awesome
Honestly, this video describes me very accurately. But I want to say one thing: "weeaboo" is not a word. I'm otaku. There is no part of "weeaboo" that means anything that otaku doesn't. Besides maybe the part about mispronouncing Japanese. The word has strange roots, it's like the otaku fandom created, "weeaboo" to alienate the weaker part of the fandom and make themselves feel better. So make fun of me all you want but understand that the word, technically, is "otaku." 

Entertaining video though.
The sad part is he's right, but he's acting like a stupid ranter which is wrong with everything in life.
10:07 Jonah Hill or naw?
+Celeste Olliffe-Gold¬†you're gonna love this

If you have to question if you're a weeaboo, you're a weeaboo.
ALLMIGHTY FRANKU-SENPAI, YOU MUST GET RID OF THE PONY AND FURRY CANCER THAT HAS SPREAD
The weirdest part of this are the weeaboo pictures at the end.
THOSE OF YOU HATING ON ANIME ARE PROBABLY JERSHEY SHORE TRASH. anyway who could hate on pokemon? Eeets technically an anime.
NO YOU C4NT FKIN MAKE FUN OF ANIME, YOU ARENT A REAL JAPANESE I AM BASICALLY JAPANESE, JUST ASK ROSETSSA STONE YOU FUCK BAKU
this is great
Anime is just means "cartoon" in english ;)
What makes me the mostly infuriated is when my fellow American brethren call them selves otaku and claim that dubbed anime shouldn't exist. I don't go around saying American cartoons shouldn't be dubbed
955 weeaboos disliked lol!
Frank your fucking weeaboo trash
so what i watch hentai and animes but you dont see my room with katanas or wallpapers with anime i agree with Frank that people are takeing this anime stuff too serious but yeah i would like to visit Japan one day but to live there not my style i wouldent give up good old Mexico for nothing and btw each culture has its own set of values and its nice to go visit once in while :) so my message to you guys is keep calm and watch but dont act like a**holes
Watches Bicu no Pico, and I want to be Japanese now
fucking weebs.
o shit, trust me i am not one.
dubstep just goes with anime.
i would have a dubstep profile picture but like that is possible there is no specific dubstep art.
:L but if there was. it would cover my profile.
dubstep.
make love to me please B0ss
...funny,the fact that an Anime IS a Japanese Cartoon (shocking, right? )

Where where where are the subtitles x)
wondering what do u do for a living? and are u bipolar (no offense)?

thanks
I have anime profile pic. You know what to do. But for fuck's sake, weeaboos are pathetic. all they do is talk about Japan and hentai and how they have "Unreallised tallent"
3:33 - 4:20 LMAO!! JAJAJAJAJA
Did anyone else scroll down to the comment section after he said he people with the anime avatars are everywhere, to see if there were any people with the anime avatar
Didn't have to scroll down to far
Just because someone has an anime picture as their profile pic dosent mean you should be warned, When I first started anime I didn't even know the meaning of weeaboo, Now I'd love to collect a couple of statues as collectibles, but I'm 14 and broke most of the time, and statues can go up to 400$ at times.

Umm there are some really cool cosplays btw
I watch anime sometimes. Most of it is just bouncing tits. Some of it is actually pretty good. Good day.
Im 13, I enjoy drawing and I like the anime style so I draw it, I even drew my profile picture. Im interested in Japan, I've actually been there and it's very pretty. I want to go there again and learn the language. I don't want to be japanese, im happy being american. It's true I like anime, I don't really talk about it. I don't Cosplay, I did it once but that was halloween. I don't collect weapons, I don't want to be japanese, and if someone says anime is shit, that's there opinion. I read manga, and I watch anime, I own some merchandise... But I don't defend anime, nor do I have an obsess with being japanese, am I a weeaboo?
My dad walked in and i had to explain what i was watching..
My favorite anime is Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood
"Prejudice equality! EVERYONE gets shit!"
Why can't more people think like this?
Yo you honestly sounded like an anime character when u was speaking jap lmaoo

anime sucks
My favorite anime is Game of Thrones
How to cure a weeaboo
Make them get a job and watch Disney movies.
My favorite anime is Teen Titans.


"Oh raven don't touch there" xD
No franku Weeaboos only watch Naruto,Bleach and Attack on titan as a Weeaboo-Expert they also don't even watch in Subtitles only Dubbed anime. But here is the important part i have discovered the cure to Weeaboos while studying there behaviors i have noticed a pattern in all of there Physical traits No Franku not that cause there all Faggots its there smell. They all smell like old dried out semen usually on there right hand. Also they are all virgins, So i decided to test a theory what if the Weeaboos can be cured by losing there virginity?,So 4 hookers and 1 dead body later my testing Weeaboo #69 has been cured. Community of filthy Franku we must stop this Epidemic. Please spread the word of the cure also if you have it in your hearts May you donate a small price of 420$ each months for 69 years. Please help the weeaboos and my¬†alcohol and Drug addiction today.

Cory in the House is a shit anime.
Cory in da House is by far the best chinese cartoon ever made, it makes Evenjelion look like shit.
Love all of this besides using faggot as an insult, seriously though weebs are the some of the most disgusting people I've ever encountered, every weeb I've met irl has tried to talk to me in Japanese (I speak English and I'm from Chicago)like that's supposed to impress me or some shit, and they're all fucking mouth breathers I swear to god
1:08
To be quite honest, only like 10% of anime watchers aren't weebs. Just my observation. As a matter of fact, the ratio is so bad where I am that there's a couple of people that say "I watch it occasionally, it's pretty good" and then there's the disgusting hairy guys (and girls even) that have Naruto wristbands, Attack on Titan headphones, One Piece t-shirts and fucking Hatsune Miku bags draped over their fat shoulders. 

Do I watch it? No, I don't really understand the appeal of it and it's too fast and flashy for me. I prefer simpler animation without a specific formula. But I feel bad for (the few) people that watch it and are afraid of ruining their reputation.
HOLDD OONN HOLD THE FUCK ON.....













You're 52?
Too many japs!
"I'm a fucking hustler." 10:45 god damn I laughed my ass off on that one.

Even as someone who loves anime seeing a weeaboo is so fucking annoying.
Its okay to like anime and stuff and maybe a bit okay to have figures but if you have a 70+anime figure collection and go to school screaming at your friends about the new SAO season coming out you should get a fucking social life
I AM ONLY HERE FOR THE WEEABOOS BUTT HURT COMMENTS....

This was truly beautiful.
Would I be considered a weeaboo if I really enjoy anime and manga and collect figures but also want to learn Japanese but wanted to learn it before getting into it? But i also like many other cultures? I find it interesting i have posters of jaws jurassic park and godzilla and 1 naruto and attack on titan but i dont dress as one and have  pillows of it?
Btw! "You can't draw anime cuz you're not japanese!" :D
finally someone else realizes all women in anime sound like they are having an orgy whenever they talk

¬†I'm At a coffee shop trying to think of how to get my shit together when i notice a cute girl is has been looking at me for some time. I smile at her and wave a little then go back to staring at my coffee.
¬†I look up to see her sitting next to me and she asks me what‚Äôs wrong, I tell her everything.
She was dumped recently too.
She's perfect.



I accidentally stare at her cleavage as she‚Äôs talking. I start to get hard. Shit.
I feel a hand run up my leg and see her breathing a bit hard, then she asks if I like what I see.
Of course.
¬†I guide her hand to my zipper she unzips my fanny pack by mistake. Spaghetti falls out and overflows all over the floor. I try to clean it up with my sock.
Doesn't work.
I start to cry and get embarrassed and fart watery diarrhea all over my man skirt. I then smear shit all over the window and ask her to marry me.
mfw she said no.
I'm posting this here because no one will see it.
DO FUCKING BRONYS
haahahahahah i totally know people like this
e x e
I'm a weeaboo..
What was the song in the background during the weaboo protection chamber scene? 6:50
"Everything I just said can be applied to any other obsession" Precisely what im worried people forget sometimes :)
Comment section
-> Full of Angry Weaboos that feel hated on
-> Full of Angry People who are hating on anybody with an Anime Icon (You know, because people put their interests as their icon, it's a thing)

Yeah I think everyone expected this XD anyways, pretty funny video tbf, Weaboos are some scary shit o.O
This video actually explained weeaboos to me, oddly enough. I'll keep this in mind, so I don't become like Weeaboo Jones.
I FUCKING LOVE THE COMMENT SECTION LMAOO LOOK AT ALL THESE WEEBS SAYING THERE OTAKUS HOLY SHIT IM CRYING
LOLL This guy is so funnyyy you gained a subscriber
Everyone who watches anime needs to die
The crux of American humour seems o be the louder you shout at the camera, the funnier it is.
LIKE IF YU CRAI EVRI TAIM
i feel like weaboo jones has trouble holding his tumour ¬†up.

i mean look at how painful walking like that and holding his tumour must be
My favorite anime is Filthy Frank
I would love to see frank make fun of furries
I've never heard of you before, nor have I ever watched your videos, but after watching this I subscribed. It's good to see someone who can look at both sides of the argument.
love when he breaks character & laughs
.
First time watching this guy's channel and I don't know what to say xD
Haha the last dude with Yui oh fuck xDDDD

Though im not a sweaty nerd who sits there all day fapping to 13 yr old anime character...
I'm a weeaboo. Yes I watch Cory in the house (COTH) But I am proud to be in de fandom. This fandom gave me friends and a place I feel wanted. So you can go fuck yourselves, I'm an weeaboo and proud. One day I will be the one in the white house.





(Obviously joking)
Bruh I had to pause you made me laugh my ass off I'm in tears
i aint a weeaboo cuz im japanese but this shit is totaly true when i went to kawaiicon (an anime convention) there were so many weeaboos
7:35 gets me everytime LOL
This is absolutely amazing! So ducking funny!
If you put on subtitles at 1:03 instead of, "in your mom's attic" it reads, "in your ball sack" WTF
franku sensei's¬†JAPANESE 101 >>>> Rosetta Stone
My favorite Anime is the Froot Loops Commercial.
You're all being trolled
When weaboos rage because you prefer to watch the english dub of an anime than watching the japanese subbed version..
im so glad i cant be a weaboo because i actually japanese
i know how to use chopsticks.. that cracked all the asians up
My little cousin is turning into a weeaboo. HOW DO I PREVENT HER FROM GOING ANY DEEPER!
Cory in the house is love, Cory in the house is life
10/10 please show this to deviantArt
I think we can all agree the best anime is Blue's clues.
I don't care what anyone says that fat misty cosplayer everyone keeps posting is fucking sexy.
Watch Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
And rethink your life.
I subscribed after seeing this and the weeaboo song.
I do collect alot of anime figures and watch ALOT of anime but i do not collect anime girl pillows and makeout with them. I also do want to learn japanese...
Filthy bloody weaboos
My favorite anime is "mad scientist turns girl into cowgirl"
And contrary to popular belief, Japanese schoolgirls and and even women don't have huge tits. cue sad violin
I would watch the full music video but after seeing that weeaboo montage I'm trying to keep my sanity in check....
Anime is the biggest fucking pile of shit. It is sickening this world one 12 year old at a time.
BOSS PLS GIMME DA PUSSY
Fuck you you'll burn in hell you bully.
i have a cat named frank
he has one eye
My avatar is mai waifu, dontchu talk shit bout mai waifu franku, I'mma fuck you up
Sure someone else adressed this, but "iie" refers to anothers home.
You meant "uchi." ¬†</faggotry>
I know many weeaboos....
XD still cracking up after 20 minutes
did this guy voice Pikachu from Brawl Taunts?
Drinking gay man cum daily will make this to your voice.
like how all the time, he's laughing at how he¬†talks
rip mad thad
Oh my god when you started talking about the thomas the train characters I choked on my water from laughing.
Cory in the House is the best anime of all time.
Seriously? Percy? Harold the Helicopter? Damn bitch u be trippin. Everyone's after the ass of Cranky!
I agree for the most part but I personally think japanese weapons are fucking cool and I think it's cool some people get some of those weapons
Japan's a nice place but, just like anywhere else on earth there are big problems.
Weeabo Jones lol im dying
this made me laugh so hard. xD nice job frank.
I could definitely be a weeaboo but you reach a point in fandom where you either step back.... or go ahead and put on cat ears. I stepped back.
hentai and weeaboos IS SHIT :)
In Mexico we have a great anime called ‚ÄúLa rosa de guadalupe‚Äú  its pretty fucking badass and stuff...
Im half asian, does that count? I also barely watch anime (basically just miasaki) but i do collect tools and weapons (useful ones, not that cheep Chinese junk) and i study different cultures and stuff (I mostly like japan for there history, but i think there weapons are quite bland)
This Man Deserves a Medal,I Respect these kind of people xD
Fuck Rosetta Stone. I recommend the learning program called "Human Japanese" and the all Japanese textbooks by "Genki: An Integrated Course" OR "Japanese for Busy People". Human Japanese is a program available on many platforms (PC, Mac, iOS, Android) and it teaches you the language and culture of Japan in small fun chapters. It's very well paced and very much like a college course.

And if there actually are some of you out there learning Japanese via Rosetta Stone, please don't. Speaking and Writing Japanese is very different for someone not already introduced to syllabic languages. Rosetta Stone is known to only teach how to speak and never gets into the culture of the languages involved.

If you're going to learn Japanese, I greatly encourage learning how to write Hiragana > Katakana > Kanji first. Learning to pronounce the syllables and then learning the words is the proper way of learning it.

People who know any of the Chinese dialects (mandarin in particular) will find Japanese Kanji easy to learn, but you should start with Hiragana anyway. 1st grade Japanese Kanji is 80 characters so it may seem intimidating but once you learn the "science" behind the ideograms you'll get past it in no time.

Kind of makes me wish American schools taught Chinese. It's a wonderful language. Also the metric system. Mostly the metric system. Thanks American school system and fucking me over for college.
Katana's for cliche fagits nodachi 4 lyfe gai bois
Holy shieeeet, is anyone here actually related to a weeaboo? as in an actual weeaboo
RIP Weeaboo jones
I totally didn't pirate Rosetta Stone to learn French and Japanese cause I don't have money to pay for actual lessons.
what is wrong with this guys voice?
Wtf is a bronie
<---This is Hatsune Miku, not an anime girl.¬†
Just to clarify.
What do my fellow chromosomes like to masturbate to?
I like  anime but f**k that $h!t up
whoa... you're 52?
I love anime, I have learned some Japanese from anime, and I like the culture. But I don't cosplay or pretend like I'm only Japanese. Am I a weeaboo?
anime is fucking trash
imma still watch it tho
I was always pretty sure I wasn't a weeaboo, but I guess im like 50-60% actually...its kinda depressing
Oh I'm going to piss off the weeaboos, piss 'em off real hard! Here I go!









Isn't anime from China?
have my babies
Please for the love of Chinchin do one about bronies!!!
what does he say at 4:15????
I hate anime
weeab0ss :>
3:27 Hi everyone, it's Filthony Frankutano here, the internet's busiest retardation nerd.
Why are there weeaboos in my moms attic?
Filthy Frank you should shit on those manchild Bronies next.
A lot of people in the comments are asking if they're Weeaboos...didn't you watch the video?????? Here's a simple way of putting it. You liking anime and watch it from time to time is not being a Weeaboo. A Weeaboo is a person who decides that obsessing over anime, manga, or japanese culture is more important than taking a shower or having a normal life outside their basement. There you go. That's a Weeaboo.
i love this channel.
what the fuck did i just watched e_O
Body pillows are a thing?... That's just weird, really really weird.
Also I r8 this video 30topkeks
I hate anime, manga, and every single game made in Japan. (Nintendo included)
Bring on the hate.
I get second-hand throat soreness from watching this guy's videos. It's also at times like these that I wish I didn't choose my YouTube name based off a name I came up with when I was 9, after having read Naruto.
I'm like half weeaboo
Anime is pretty shit.
Just wanna ask a few question. I sometimes watch anime, I draw mostly in manga style, and I have a Ghost in the Shell wallscrool. I wan't to learn japanese, simple cos that's the only asian language I like. I love japanese culture. I love japanese food. But on a healthy level. Yeah I don't want to be or be like a japanese person... Am I a weeaboo?

I'm turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese I really think so
Turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese I really think so
I'm turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese I really think so
Turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese I really think so
Anime is fucking trash. love that quote
Anime is cool. Cosplay is cool. Enjoying both is cool. Having a couple anime posters is also cool. Now when all you ever talk about is anime and won't shut up and have nothing to do with anything other than anime, not cool. Basically that's what this video is about. And to anyone who says, "If you watch anime and cosplay, you're a weeaboo," you're an uncultured swine. We have Filthy Frank here admit he likes some anime. And in this video, he cosplayed (even though it is not conventional cosplay), and he isn't a weeaboo for that. There is a big difference between enjoying anime and cons and such, and living anime. For those of you who didn't understand the video because your IQ is too low, or you have that big of a distaste for anime and wanted to start an argument, it is invalid. Good day.
is that really how he sound when talking?
ANIME IS STUPID!!! COME FUCK ME UP!>:^)
Hello, my name is uh, Cowboy Tanaka. Lol
Rosetta stone.
King of the Hill > All other animes
THIS IS SO GREAT LMAO
My favorite anime is Dr Phil
Where the fuck is he filming this...
Japan is mostly Xenophobic towards other Asian countries. This was my experience when I visited the country. If you are a foreigner from the western hemisphere you will be treated well. But If you are from any other Asian country, expect to be treated like shit.
If I saw a weeaboo out in public I would take out the nearest sharpest object and stab them in the fucking throat and watch them die in a puddle of their own herpes infested blood. Holy fuck that got graphic really god damn quick.
Anime is disgusting. If you watch it, you must be a no life nerd.
can i ask a serious question? Why does this man appear to be having some sort of hernia and why is he always doing that weird tense voice??? It sounds like batman fucked that weird kid in middle school and they had a fucked up baby that had serious vocal issues.¬† Literally watching him makes me uneasy and stressed out.¬† I can't tell if he would have more or less views if he would just be normal....
Cowboy Tanaka hahaha
My favorute anime is Two and Half men. so popular right now, omg.
arigato godzaimas
i dislike anime
There are to many people with Anime characters as their avatar here :(
Your neighbors must hate you and think you're weird but I think your cool...ish
if you own one of those body pillows you already have a problem.
4:10 is so goddamn spot on.
No Waifu No Laifu :v Weaboos so funny
Idk about weaboo's i didn't actually got to meet a full fledged one(at least i don't think i did, never seen anything even close to the pics on this vid and the net), only anime fans/watchers (myself being one) that usually don't even talk about anime most of the time, but bronies are a bigger problem.. Especially in the R18 rated sections. Dear Jesus, they post sht that gives grown men nightmares.
Anime sucks anyways :/
My favorte anime is sienfield
cause you know i get all that pussy... and its scrumdidlyumptious
tfw you identify as an attack helicopter
I think the words "outaku" and "weaboo" have lost their "meanings" in time
Weeaboos are the worst type of people.
so many idiots seem to have either not payed attention or doesn't know what a weeaboo is. a person with a anime profile pic does not make them a weeaboo and watching anime doesn't either as stated by frank as well. seriously people calling a person with a anime looking avatar a weeaboo is pretty much the same thing as calling a person with a western profile character such as a marvel hero or any other western cartoon character a westaboo it is stupid, wrong, and incorrect. it only makes you look and sound more stupid than you already are. probably the majority of you that are trolling the otakus need to relearn what a weeaboo is and how to properly use it. i don't like or watch anime but atleast i know what the real meaning of weeaboo is unlike most of you.
Wtf? Why was the joke with the jews guys mistranslated?
hi frank is that north korea language u are speak when u are speak the language that not english? thank let me know if it north korea language
It's funny, cause Franku is kinda neglecting his Australian heritage. There is absolutely nothing "down under"about him. He pretty much sounds like an American, who happens to be half Japanese. Not that I have a problem with that, but it contradicts with what he said in the video. But I guess it's okay since he actually lives in the States now.
that sexy Japanese voice !
How dare you accuse me of being someone who uses anime icons- wait.....errr........let me just go ahead aaand. slowly backs out of youtube
EY B0SS
FUCK YOU WEEABOO JONES I LOVE FAMILY GUY
Reality Cheek XD
9:49 is that akeno?

Weaboos are disgusting XD
Am I weeaboo if I like anime, and I'm trying to learn japanese on websites? I don't have any anime-related contents in my house, tho. And I will never buy a dakimura thingy. And I don't try to be japanese Irl.
10:08 his nipples are huge and really round
''Cory in the house''
xD
Weeaboo Jones. XD
What is the music he uses?
This nigga fucking right GAHAHHAHA WEEABOS ARE RETARded
Weeaboos licked my ass and I pick up a manga and now I'm a weeaboo
Honestly, you may have middle school humor but it's pretty funny. 10/10 simply because you make videos that YOU enjoy making, props to you.
aslo hentai m80 i watch it and i wanna be a brony weeaboo (aka:faggot)
where are my subtitles?
Give this man a medal
I keep bestiality porn on tab in case someone walks in my room, its easier to explain
MY FAVORITE ANIME IS CALL OF DUTY
My sides are in orbit!
10:08 Moist man boobs
879 people are weeaboos
THAT ANIME IMPERSONATION THO.
What if I watch anime and I want to learn Japanese to not have to wait for the sub or dub version?
This was epic!
kawaii desu ne sugoi!!!!!!!!1
I am a weeabooo! :D
and I dont care.
I just love and respect anime and Japanese culture
Weeaboo Jones is the final boss of the internet!
People with anime avatars are such fags.
Lol this woulda been funny if he talked normally xD
0:09
"There are two Jews in my closet....They are both dead"
Am I a weaboo? I watch a couple anime like 10-25ish, didn't know what manga was until a couple of months ago. I don't own any merchandise and I have so far failed 4 otaku tests normally being under 50%.
This is a story of my old friend. Rest in peas. She rides my bus and is a big weaboo üò• and all she does is sit in the back of the bus with with some ainame on her computer sometimes she brings her boyfriend (looks like hitter with a bowl cut) one like = 1 deleted ainame vid. Oh yeah she smells like female deer "stuff"
You've got to be kidding me... so i was like in art class sitting to this huge fat nasty smelly girl and she was talking about how she draws anime and like knows every little detail about attack on titan (don't get me wrong i love that anime) and she freaks out when i forget some tiny stupid detail and after this video i just realize how many of them are infested in my high school... i need a weeaboo shelter...
I want to visit Japan one day, mainly to stay at the Godzilla hotel. What can I say, I like me some stompy dino-monsters. But I don't disrespect the culture like some other ass hats out there. I'm still 100% red-blooded A'Merican.
Seinfeld is the best anime.
lol¬† nice vid

YOU'RE 52?!
pfft i love anime and u dont see me replacing it with my rl life, heck i have a job and im 20 >.> i love this video tho~
Holy shit I paused the vid, turned off my iPhone and it still stayed at the same spot same vid 0_o
1:51 best
you re the best
Any time I go on a Japanese song, a part of the comments are Spanish or something, another part is normal people who commented years ago, then the more recent comments are a bunch of weaboos. Gosh, you can watch anime without being a faggot¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
He makes a good point here. He doesn't have anything against anime, he just saying take it easy over the obsession which could be applied to anything. Plus I think Filthy Frank casually watches Naruto based on the references he keeps making :3
Fuck Anime
lmfao attack on titan is fucking trash tho
Anime-lovers, be an otaku, not a weeabo
He tries so hard to be funny. Good for him. Some people like his content. I, however, don't. Whatever floats your boat.
Destroy build destroy is the best anime faggot
Oh god that Pomp and Circumstance line on recorder
gold
anime is my favourite toy story
A NUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
This videos r so funny i cry everyothr video. Havent dont tht in a while lol
Lol at the start in japanese when he says are you ready to have some fun i sure am he's actually saying i have jews in my closet they're all dead
So this is were that Cory in the house thing came from
What do you call a girl that can run faster than her brothers? A redneck virgin
This is my first time watching a Frank video and my mind was blown!
every disliker is a weeaboo
I just really wanna see this guy do a Tingle cosplay form Zelda.
What's the song that starts at 6:42 ?
Most weeaboos live in america thus i fucking hate that country
So im not a weeaboo. TT~TT
Song at 6:42 ?
I dont care if im a weeaboo or not,i live my life as i want,i like anime,manga and i will live in japan,i know that japan is a normal country like other,but i really dont care, that is that i decided.
You forgot the yaoi. 
DEAR GOD THE YAOI
This is great.
what about cosplayers though?
Thank you, Filthy Frank. You have inspired me.

I have had enough of Weeaboo's for quite some time, and my school is FILLED with them, but this video inspired me to take action. I've started an Anti Weeaboo Alliance at my school, we call ourselves the Weeabusters, And we will spend every waking moments of our young lives making sure that the earth is wiped clean of this threat.

#JoinTheAlliance
Is it bad if I'm just a hardcore fan but start to have weeaboo-ish tendencies?
Man I wish he'd make more videos like this, I feel like most of his videos are pretty short. Love the show +TVFilthyFrank
Filthy frank I promise your hilarious and I'm always watchin your videos manüòÜüòÜ man I hope you continue to make some more!!
Still better than the bee movie
Hey there are two different kinds of perverts! There are open perverts and there are closet perverts! I myself prefer the first! ;) ;) Log Horizon ;) ;)
OMG
oh, hello there
I personally have a pact with my older brother. "The moment I greet him with "Konichiwa!!!" when we aren't in japan, he's allowed to shoot me in the face."
I was expecting to see Misaka Mikoto in the comments
Fucking Weeaboos
i don't think i'm a weeaboo maybe i'm a wee just at about that much i love anime and i like buying there swords for decorating my house but that about that xD but make fun away i don't mind as long as you let salamander man rub my nips
Yo, Melon pan is actually hilarious tho. And I'm pretty sure he makes fukin serious bank with all the shit he has in his house.
Your neighbors must fucking hate you...
Only good thing to come out of my weeb days was taking a course and learning Japanese. 
So that's pretty cool I mean what do I do with that now
So sick of being called a weeaboo because of my love for toy story 
I AM A TOY DAMMIT 
On the inside
Everything said in this video is accurate to a tee.
being the algerian that i am. this is beutiful. :) Allahu Akbar
This is my house pigeon
I'm missing the joke, whats this "realm" thing? something from naruto?
Dude, you are so crazy, and you're on like a different level, and I love it and I laugh all the time. Thank you
Judge Judy has got to be one of the most overrated animes of all time.
Can I collect kitana's as a history fan ??
The only reason why I'd ever go to Japan (not happening anyway), would be to play games at an arcade there. Other than that, I don't have too much to do there. I like manga and japanese animation. But I'm not interested in weapons of any kind, nor in learning their language, which I consider extremely complex and unefficient when learning an alphabet of 26 characters is easier, and you can still comunicate.

How many alphabets does Japan has? 4? 5? And how many characters? There are like thousands of them? Seriously?

I would still enjoy some of the views, in a quiet, romantic place like a temple or something in the mountains. And then there is this kawaii girl with alien eyes and cat ears, staring at me and saying things like "Kimochii-desu", "Y-yamete kurasae!", in a moany, 13 years old voice that would make everyone laugh, if anyone in this world could speak normally with such a voice.

It's just a hobby. Like this people that enjoy normal comics, or movies. I like comics too, I'm not a huge fan of the movies though. Of course there are idiots who get way too obsessed with it and make a world out of it. Not everyone is like that... But well, what am I saying? Everyone here is already aware of this.

g2g. I think I forgot to clean my body pillow.
Anyone else see pbg?
Hold it, wait, does collecting Asian weapons make you a weaboo?
I showed all of my friends the Filthy Frank show and they ALL LAUGHED THIER ASSES OFF!!! LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!
I bought some kind of japenese sword when I was about 10 
I feel like the biggest fag when I think that I spent money on them 

Fuck
"WHEN I WAS LITTLE I WANTED TO BE THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE BUT THAT SHIT NEVER HAPPENED"
Cory in the House is my favorite anime
I AM BREATHING REALLY HEAVY
is that the connivers kunai lol
ey +TVFilthyFrank¬†b0ss maek a video about weeaboos,bronys, abortion, vegetarianism, and jesus skin color

prepare for 9-11
So what you're saying is, when it comes to America, you better love it or weeb it!
All WEEABOS have neckbreads that are ridden with acne and cheeto stain
WAKE ME UP WHEN ALL THE DIRTY WEEABOOS ARE DEAD
This video did its job: offend a ton of people and start pointless and childish internet arguing.
REALITY CHECK !
I SWEAR, WHAT IS THE MUSIC AT 6:45 ONWARDS ? IT IS GOLDEN THE WAY YOU USE IT LOL!!
I'M NOT A WEEABOO BUT ATTACK ON TITAN WAS REALLY GOOD
Cool o.o
I'm so sad I only found this channel now
7:24 OMG frank u dont even liek naruto, everyone knows Sharingan isnt a special attack its an ability or a body part
Breaths heavily
The only Japanese I will ever learn will be from the filthy Frank show.
How does a weeaboo end their prayer?
R'amen






Just kidding, weeaboos are Godless heathens.
holy fuck filthy frank cannot be over 50 he looks like he is in his mid 30s fucking hell damn...50 and not married? i understand u dont want to make all the other girls sad by marrying one eh? nice job playa
il rek u wid my katana coolerection. I get all deh grills wet faker, yer mader is ded. shit yu.
you don't see Americans carrying eagles everywhere (even though it would be awesome if we could) ¬†then why act like japanese and run to school with bread
I LOVED THOMAS DA TRAIN
+TVFilthyFrank¬†You have a subreddit dedicated to you, you know?¬†
Just asking/telling you.
So if I say shit like...

ANIME IS FUCKING RETARDED.

I'll get flamed on.










And they may or may not bother to read this, but that was a fucking joke.¬† I love watching anime but I'm not a god damned weeaboo.¬† I'm a gamer at best.¬† A gamer that likes Japanese anime, which is surprisingly common.
No offense but I really dislike weeaboos. Every time there's an anime reference all the comments would be mostly filled with weeaboos and every time someone says anime is cartoon they're all gonna be like NO, ANIME IS NOT CARTOON LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE T_T CAN'T U SEE? THE HAIR, BODY, EYES, ETC. Why is it so hard for them to accept that anime is a cartoon? I even ask some of them to watch a VERY OLD anime and they wouldn't still believe me.
I though pigeons were scared of Asians
I was nine years old when daddy first touched me.
Hero. My name is cowboy Makoto and I ride bareback. If you know what im saying. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
thE PIGEON IM DEAD
weeaboos be like "I took a bath yesterday senpai."
i just realized the anime profile pics are everywhere.
holy shit.
R U A WEEABOO??!!
Weeaboos are the reason we need to bring hitler back
Anime profile pics are for faggots.
Tenno Heika BANZAI!
Dont make fun of me for having an anime profile pic stupid baka gajin ^_^
oh thank god im not a weeaboo. im obsessed with anime, want to live in japan and work in the anime industry but i wouldent want to be japanese... i guess i just want to live there lifestyle?
My Favorite anime is Dr. Phil.
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.
FINALLY, IM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT WANTS TO PEIRCE PERCY'S ASS
It's funny how many people comment and they are weaboos lol
Ey boss!

My favorite anime is Thomas and Friends
I won't hurt you :>, there's no rasengan up my ass either, also I don't care if you hate Anime or Japanese culture, that's fully up to you.
I collect weapons, but they're usually antiques... or actual weapons, not anime-based bullshit.
LOOOOOOOOOOL.
This is my favourite video on the internet.
Es g0od b0ss
Anime sucks.
My favorite anime is Camp Lazlo

Beavis and Butthead is best anime tho.
My favorite anime consist of passion of the Christ, dog with a blog, and North Korean propaganda films


My favorite manga is Mein aka of
I would pay ungodly amounts of money to get an hour long recording of you just moaning and yelling 'Itai! Yamete!'.
Fuck you, that pigeon is my wife

I want someone to go through all of these commwnts and total up the amount of anime profile pictures.
mlp is my favorite anime
8:01 are you fucking serious papa franku you are using happy wheels sprites i thought you were better than this
anime impressions were so spot on i cringed.
I couldnt breath at cory in the house.
Will all borderline pedophiles please follow me? Ok that makes 99%...Will all other people please go sit in the corner, make really high pitched noises, and scream "yes" every once in a while? Good. Everyone following me watch closely and breathe heavily while typing fast!
4:10 aahhahaha that's like every anime ever
I noticed that all of Frank's top comments are either his or weeaboos. :(
love me franku!
"aye bose"
what if you want to work at FUNamation USA? does that make me a weeaboo?
The person at 10:14 is the swiss youtuber Melon Pan who is actual a pretty nice but extremely crazy person.
cory in the house isn't anime !!! >xD
I came here from  #DOTA2 ¬†Guids.
Subscribed
After watching To Love Ru, I successfully know everything about japan, everything about the language and everything about japanese girls. Your argument is invalid.
[insert weeaboo comment here]
somebody please make a gif of 7:44 or send me a link if there is one!
Frank have you ever thought about taking up the anime girl voice acting career? You could be successful.
this is funny LOLOL
1:05
dat voice crack, b0ss.
NEVER
TURN
ON
THE
SUBTITLES/CC

You will be reading shit.
What i hate about weeaboos is the fact that most of them pronounce "Desu" wrong.
Its not pronounced De-soo its pronounced De-ss.
I got 60% on my Japanese test and i already know this shit.
I wonder what the Weeaboos for other countries are called. Like what would a Chinese, or French, or Swedish version of a Weeaboo be called?
You're a beautiful motherfucker Frank.
nice !
The first 5 minutes, man I'm dying. Nice going there!
Tmw mine is the main character from persona 3, which is a game ;-; don't yell at meh frank
up next on the butt hurt list:
bronys
4:14 to 4:18 üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüëåüëåüëå
Labels of the 2000s and 2010s, most of them I guess I don't see¬†much nuance to. Let's take weeaboo for example. I remember when weeaboo wasn't even a word people used. We just called them pretentious xenophobic douche bags, so - why not just call them pretentious xenophobic¬†douche bags¬†still? Why is them being a fan of¬†Japanese culture/media, anime, cosplaying, etc.¬†really relevant? I mean, if that's really just as¬†important then wouldn't it be kinda¬†hypocritical¬†to use the word in the first place? You'd become akin to¬†the word you just tried to use to discredit someone if that's how the definition really is. I think it's pretty douche bag-like to make someone's interests the grounds you'd insult someone on. Does anyone else find it ironic, or have I misinterpreted the word?

I'm trying to not lose my faith in humanity I guess. lol
Weeaboos are annoying but not nearly as bad or dangerous the right-wing xenophobic type. Barf.
I like anime... and this is hilarious to me XDD
If I would have not seen this video I would not like to thing where my life would be now....
Thank you for these videos, they have helped me over come my fear of vanilla wafers allowing me to lead on a healthy wafer free life you are truly a hero crys tears of joy because hes a bitch with a fear of wafers
rape me.
I feel ya man. I used to want to be Thomas the Tank Engine too. ;_;

Ey b0ss GIVE MEH DA PUSI PLEZ
filthy frank is the greatest person on the internet 2015
ok...i really love anime and all...but im not a weeaboo...

Now I'm afraid to like anything anime based.
Note note to self: do not watch while high :P
japanese people are actually that xenophobe ?
ya
I personally really like anime, but I'm not going to hate on someone for saying it's bad. I can see why people would dislike anime.
how can he speak japanese so well? ^^
Weaboos "Shutup Japanese people luves us"
Filthy Frank (half-Japanese) "go home and die weaboos"
Weaboos "..."
7/10 MAN YOU SHOULDN'T RELY ON URBAN DICTIONARY MAN 7/10
THIS GUY IS FUCKING AMAZING HAHAHAHAAHAH
9:57 Is... is that PBG?
I'm offensive and I found this weeaboo.
Totally like me. I approve.
yeah dont talk shit about attack on titan!
just saying
You can love anime without being a weeaboo
muh favrite animoo is robocop
WHERE CAN I GET A PINK GUY SUIT YOU LITTLE SHIT
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Weeaboos make me feel ashamed to be a Anime fan.
Was it bad that I was watching this while eating ramen with chopsticks?
LMAO. What a fucked up nutbag.

SS
We all have dreams, I just wanted a piece of percy's ass you feel me? LMAO!!!
when he says "are you ready to learn" in the beginning, he is really saying "i hid the foreigners body in the closet". Thats the real translation.
That Japanese voice 2 sexy.
Wanting something to be true doesn't make an actual truth..
Anyone see a parallel there?
i just love this video
I like how none of the weaboos know about fist of the north star. Plebs.
My favorite anime is The Chica Show. You gotta watch it
ohmygod
All the top comments are people with anime pictures,
Hey weeaboo trash! Pink Guy is on Miiverse! Go to search users on activity feed and look up Pink Guy. If his description is "Ey b0ss" then you're in for a great time!
You should make fun of Filipinos...
WEEABOO!
WEEABOO!
is he half japanese? does not look like he is 100% japanese.
Okay. So I'm just going to say this. The idea and theme of Attack On Titan was good, but the story was‚Ä¶ look I don't understand why titans look like these autistic giant humanoids. But then again, I'm watching FilthyFrank, so I digress. :3
KAWAIIII,... no srsly this is really awkward.
TALK SHIT ABOUT BRONIES
OMG WHY U SHIT TALKIN WEEABOS IMA GET MY WHOLE GANG UP IN HERE AND SHOOT YA ASS WITH MY katana collection
Only weeaboos disliked this b0ss
The amount of rage in the comments is too damn high! 

 


A long time ago I used to watch anime (age 15.   I'm 18 now )but  
Then I found out about weaboos...

Fucking fags take a fictional universe from a fuckin drawing and ruin it for the rest of us 

I like fighter jets and aviation
And you Don't see me putting wings on my back and  running around making engine noises....


Fuck weeabos
Anime School girl eyes xD i watch anime but i'm not a weeaboo ¬†the only intention i would have thought of going to japan is to study abroad but that's really all i would go for its not like waifu paradise Reality Check
I need sum protection from all the damn anime lovers Oh my god i have to stop looking the comments üåöüî´
I wish they sold weeaboo extermination tools such as a gun, their disapproving parents, and the movie The Lion King
My favorite anime is Boku no pico ‚ô•
yet again clicked a random video and laughd
What's a weeaboo?
God damn animemes
I'm studying Japanese. Is it bad?
STFU nerds
i love filthy frank so much
wwww chotto matte why did you kill them lol
Not to offend anyone who liked the show,but Thomas' face always sacred me. Anyone else?
What the fuck?
Cory in the house was alright but the new Micky Mouse Clubhouse is da crap!
I watch anime and I have an Attack on Titan bracelet. Like 10% weeaboo. #fuckthehaters
52 years old? Holy shit, I hope you don't die in 20 or 30 years! YOU MUST LIFE FOREVER!!!
Honestly, Full House is prefect. A bit of the hentai was weird but otherwise, PERFECT.
Whats hilarious is that in this specific video I see absolutely no one without an anime profile picture.
so many fucking weeaboos in these comments ¬†it makes me sick
my favorite anime is porn
In the beginning of the video, he is saying that he has two jews in his closet. They are both dead.
I'm at least 6% sure Chris-chan isn't a weeb
He's just a fucking cunt
Fucking fat filthy weaboos!
...Did frank say he's 52?
Soo, katana wall hangers that are simply for decorative purposes because you like the way they look are off limits because they mean you're a weeaboo? So by that logic, I have a body pillow that I fuck twice a day and I dream to go to Japan. I'm not in the slightest interested in going to Japan because I know I would be confused as shit trying to understand what they're saying to me. I would probably understand about 12 words (because anime) but besides that I would be the most confused person ever. All this because of a, remember, purely decorative piece that is not meant for combat. Sounds retarded when I put it that way huh.
The simpsons are the only anime
YEAH YOU KNOW I WATCH THAT SHIT BRUH
Anime
Cons:
Shit voice acting
Voices that dont fit the character at all
Stupid storylines and plots
Some wierd framerate shit is not working and looks lazy
Pros:
Nice lightening effects and animation/models
lol dude you're f&cking crazy! awesome stuff
I ACCIDENTLY CAME ON CAPS BUT I DONT KNOW WHERE THE BUTTON IS TO UNLOCK IT????? PLS HELP
Corey in the house xD.
Is his voice naturally like that???  Sorry this is my first time watching him...  :/
This is hilarious, but keep in mind that there is a difference between Otaku's and Weeaboo's, just because someone is a collector of anime memorabilia doesn't automatically make them a weeaboo, it's when they have the naked anime stuff and masturbate to that shit that it's creepy as fuck
Me finishing anime- That was good.
Friends- OMG WHO DO YOU SHIP!!!!!!????
less git sum pussie 2nite
I fucking love methamphetamine
Filsy Furanku Showe
anyone and everyone that isn't japanese and watches anime and acts like a weeaboo is a freaking Weeaboo
Is my profile picture kawaii uguu
all the anime pictures!! THERES SO MANY
Shit ,... im a borderline pedophile :(
Funniest shit i've seen in a long time.
This guy is my spirit animal, seriously.
can we just slingshot the earth into the sun?
you're voice sounds so hot in japanese!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just saying, I'm not a weeaboo
Am I a weeaboo? My profile picture is the main character of the best anime of all time¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
RREIURVJHUVFIRIBREBIRUIREUBRBDFVBDRRJUBVREBJFDJBRDRHJFVRFDFH VFVVHHFDHJDFHFDBFDHDFHJRVHV FEFVSAJFVBFVJRBFAUFA (im not a weaboo i just did this as a joke and yes i did breath HEAVILY)
I tried to hook up with a weeaboo once. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
She fucking rejected me, fucking weeaboo hoe.
Probaly the fucking cat ears she wore that made me like her.
I don't even think she even liked cory in the house.
8:41 Holy shit is that Gaben!?!
excus me ths video iz very offenzive and i know muCH MOR ABOUT JAPAN THAN YOU SMH PFF GRUNTS
RIP Weeaboo Jones you will not be missed
Anyone know what the music that starts at 6:41 is? I tried Darude Sandstorm and many variations of it, but to no avail.
This was the first Filthy Frank video I watched and my sides are now in orbit and I'm also a fan.
My favourite anime was welcome to the ricefields
What the fuck did you just fucking say about anime, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I was ranked best Otaku in my anime club, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on hentai websites, and I have over 300 waifus. I am trained in katana warfare and I‚Äôm the top ninja in my entire Naruto Online clan. You are nothing to me but just another casual. I will jutsu you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Japanese penpals across the world and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, Yamcha. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing that is your no anime life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, baka. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can notice you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Japanese Samurai Armory and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù video was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn baka. I will shit rasengan all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, anime hater.
Frank talk shit about the "friendzone"
Man, I feel dangerously close to being a weeaboo. Thankfully I have other interests apart from anime, like literature and the indie music scene in my city. Actually if it wasn't for the fact I like anime and play video games I'd probably be a hipster right now which would be just as bad. Oh no it wouldn't because despite having to put up with the hipster bullshit and having to grow a beard to compensate for my lack of personality I'd at least get laid. Even if it was with some dumb hippy chick who talked about spirituality. I guess Nietzsche was right, God is dead. Wow I didn't expect to have an existential crisis on what social category I fall under after this video. Thanks Filthy Frank.
I didnt know Frank was 52?
Most of the people dissing anime couldn't write a better story than noragami, and that's saying something( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
So when I moved to my new school I was like "maybe I should join a club , what do I like... Maybe anime?" I was like awww shit FUKEN WEEABOOS o lawdy HELL NO
Hey guys, what's the Arabic song frank used???
Is it still considered weeaboo if you wanted to be Japanese and fit in with modern day Japanese culture? If so I used to be a fuckin weeaboo
My favorite digimon in the pokedex is Goku.
I like the Idea of Prejudiced Equality.
I think I'm going to commit to it.
I haven't laughed this hard in a while. Awesome video, Filthy Frank! :D
I mean, sheyyyt weeaboos are fags and all, but no need to hate them that much. At least they're not bronies.
can someone translate at 3:52 ? is that what he really says in the subtitles
Your voice frightens me.
when he speaks japanese he sounds like an anime guy
...
ill wait for you to catch onto my joke
Puberty,  have you gone through it yet?  Your voice betrays you...
I didn't get the redneck joke, why can a Redneck virgin run faster than her brothers?

Also, you're 52? no fucken way.

Also, before yesterday I didn't know what a Weeaboo is, one of your subscribers directed me to the answers, and today I see you have a vid on the topic, and yeah, I subscribed...
this guy is so gad dayum annoying, but i love that in him
And then they use words like waifu and Senpai that I don't even know what they mean.
what?
WHAT U SUPER SAIYAN ABOUT ANIME?
My favourite anime is Homestuck.
Hahaha, I love seeing all these loosers with anime profile pictures commenting on this. I hope your waifu gives you herpes. you fat cartoon porn onii-chans. Go listen to some virtual latex boots and blue hair bitch with extremely high pitched voice. That "music" or "vocaloid" or how you call it is even worse than "BVB" or "Blood on the dance floor". You should get a life, listen to real music and watch REAL anime. Like Beavisu-kun & Buttheadu-chan
hey boss
I'll admit I'm a major xenophile, but I'm just as interested in European film culture as I am in anime, and yeah I agree with you on everything.
filthy frank is best anime
Obvious troll is Obvious
what if you have a ninato just to have one?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA NICE ONE WITH THE SUBTITLES AT THE BEGINNING
clicks on a filthyfranku video.. a shitty rapper appears in the form of an ad...

(._.)

YT needs o chin chin..
Hey, not all weeaboos are fond of Japan! And not all of them talk like that. I'm a weeaboo and I have weeaboo friends, none of them like Japan better than any other country (except Russia. Russia sucks). We don't think that we are Japanese. We are just filthy disgusting hermits who watch anime and buy figures on occasion.
You speak really good Zimbabwese :D
Talks shit about anime nek minnit ...¬†
"A wild WEEABOO has appeared!"
Weaboo:Hey guys im going to have a threesome!

"Friends":you mean with your hand and pillow right?
I'm crying laughing like a f*cking hyena at this x'D
+TVFilthyFrank¬†congratulations you have a new subscriber x'D
Da fuck did i just watch?
did u guys see that new anime called pawn stars?!?!

its the best anime on the history channel
My brother thinks im a weaboo or what ever and i have only seen one kid frendy and have no anima toys or pillows ew nasty
What's the background music at 6:41?
I'm not a weeaboo, I may like anime,¬†read manga, collect merchandise, I shower every 2 days, but I'm more of a Homestuck rather than anime anyways. I like MineCraft and Homestuck lmao.¬†

Is that a weeb?
My favorite anime is Thomas the Tank Engine.
I've got that Percy body pillow mmmm.
If you spell weeaboo backwards it roughly sounds like "virgin"
I really like the chinese manga Hannah x Montana
807 weebaoos have disliked this video :)
807 weebaoos have disliked this video :)
Well somebody just earned my subscription. xD
"Because you know I get all that pussy." "And it is scrumdiddlyumptious"
I think the¬†Japanese flag is a pie chart of how many Weeaboos need subtitles when they go to Japan
kys please
"I just wanted some of percy's ass"
Holy fuck I lost
there was this I once  kid who pretended to be Japanese and sang a song incorrectly, implementing random ass Japanese  words that I knew didnt belong

he wasn't even close to being Japanese
Dear god. I may use a Leafeon as my avatar as I play the card game and games but damn. ¬†The sad part is I know a Weeaboo who is way to much like this
EXAMPLE: This Fag was watching Henti In the middle of class.
My favourite anime is countdown on channel 4
"Oh, look" I like "Anime/Manga" AND "Marvel/D.C. Comics......" Sh*t Now who the FUCK is gonna "SAVE" me??????
This is the best thing I've seen in awhile xD lmao
B-but ;_; It means my dream to become a Japanes Mahou Shoujo hime will never come true!!? Shi-sh-shi kusooooooooooooo... (I cri naw ;_;)
my waifu is coming to lifu
I love how he looks ugly here but when you see normal him.
Like what the fuck just happened
Almost vomited at the montage of weaboos at the end. Pls no.
But like animae
OMG HOW DARE YOU!

UNSUB

THIS OFFENDS ME!!!!!! B-BAKA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@ 4:56

FINALLY IM NOT TEH ONLY ONE WHO SEES IT
if you like japan, youre a weeaboo, if not youre racist!

Id rather be racist, after watching this reject from heaven.
this must be the best video I've ever watched. xD
Howdy, my name is Kenichi Smith.
I'm a 27 year old Japanese Toonaholic (Cartoon fan for you foreigners). I draw cartoons and comics on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior American games. (Halo, Gears of War, Call of Duty)
I train with my 1911 every day, this superior weapon can shoot straight through steel because it kicks ass, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my gun license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.
I speak English fluently, both the Midwestern and the East Coast accents, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their Constitution, which I follow 100%
When I get my American visa, I am moving to New York to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Nickelodeon or a game designer!
I own several cowboy outfits, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I keep cool to my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.
Wish me luck in America!
>Not embracing the glorious Nippon
>2015
My cheeto dust covered waifu body pillow finds this offensive.
My favourite anime is Jersey Shore
You¬¥re a sick ass pig but I like it somehow ;-)
Yeah, pretty spot on.
Let me apologize about him as a Japanese.
My favourite anime is Cars 2
ey b0ss
Funny how I'm gonna post this when my avatar is indeed anime, plus my videos have anime pictures.
But I'm gonna wing it.¬†
I completely agree with this hilarious man. I can say my younger was indeed a total anime freak (my his teen aged soul rest peacefully). However, I'm no Otaku or whatever they call it as I used to be... Although, I never did buy junk like katanas or some shit. Just read manga all day. xD
As for now, I enjoy some occasional anime here and now. Course, I can never escape it cause I'm way into JRPGs... And well, you know. Lots are anime? Peace. :3
filthyfrank i wanna meet you ¬†bro you so funny men :) good video
<------3:07 ¬† ¬†oh god
I don't know why Japanese isn't considered a "romance language " because anything whispered in Japanese sounds sexual
Holy fuck im so sorry society
Jesus Christ, that was a fucking journey.
You Like my Avatar?
Danny Phantom was my life....UNTIL WEABOOS
anime!!
source on 11:18?
Why do you have two dead people in your closet
:,) I'm guessing I'm not a weaboo prays to Jesus
I started crying when he said Cory In The House.
You sir, have earned another sub.
Please talk about bronnies there fagots on the internet who post there my little pony shit you probally already seen there disgusting shit but can you talk about it because lf you do they might grow the fuck up
I don't see anything wrong with a katana collection. Katanas are cool. I want one.
Sometimes you guys are so good at sarcasm ( sarcasm I think?¬ø) that I can't tell if you're fucking with my head or not.
HahahahahaXDlol
Coreys a busta
PLZ GIB THE MELONPAN
I lose it at 3:29 every time..
filthy frank is a faggot
I'm a weeaboo from India and I'm fuckin proud of it! japs<3
Hahahahaahahahahahaha I lawd at the shoulder look when he did the girl anime voice. Ohhhh Lawdy lawd!
What's wrong with your voice! Hahahahaahahahahahaha
Is this guy Japanese American? Lol. What a jack ass! I like him!
Om mah gawd!   I just found this channel.... First video. Lololol
i fucking love this guy
Oh my god, he said: "I have two Jews in my closet. They're dead." and subtitled it: "Are you ready to have some fun? I sure am!"

Frank, you are one epic man. Respect from Japan! ^_^
FUCK YOU WEEABOO JONES!
Anime sucks dick
dude this guys is so right really i mean i have a brother who keeps katanas dresses like a fucking retard from some anime on halloween and instead of doing it like me who just wants an addition to my languages he tries to learn it from the animes which is sad
anime nerds are fags
You sir, are a fuckwit
Oh yeah my dad bought me a Mall Katana (for display, not gonna kill anyone with it) for my 10th birthday. 4 years later he tells me it's from an anime like "become a weeaboo already"
Omg 4:10 i was waiting for BAKA. that was aperfect anime accent.
Bae - "Put it in~"
Me - "It is in"
Bae - "....."
i dont know about any weeaboo calling himself as Japanese
You know... Something just struck me.
A lot of the anime characters are not only a virgin but they have this hot chick chasing after them and they are too fucking a-sexual to notice it and those anime characters who actually are interested about chicks are just being labeled as creeps.
No wonder weeaboos are pathetic virgin losers. They are following a character trait of their favorite shows!
You sound like ForneverWorld in the scenes with the purple wig, lol.

He is such an annoying weab lol
Kuntnichiwaa.
Oops. KAWAII DESU OAMFJKNGAJISHNF¬†

xD
¬†Sorry I heard the whole anime profile pic xD
Hands-down best anime ever is Nicholas cage's wickerman             The animation: do I even need to go into detail on how great it is      The acting: extremely cartoony and awesome                              Best line: not the bees
I think Mythbusters in my favorite anime.
I replayed the song like 100 times
9:46 POKEMON EAT
4:32 best part. XD
The only reason why this doesn't have more dislikes and butthurt comments is because most of those weeaboo retards call themselves otakus because they are too stupid to know that they are weeaboos
Harro. My name-a is-u Cowboy Parakka
you actually learn more japanese from japanese 101 than you learn from anime!
6:40 franku been sippin on dat arizona  #sadboys ¬†#2001  #emotionalboys

Filthy Frank I understand your pain I did all I could to turn into thomas the train engine. I did voodoo magic, I joined every religion, and I even wished upon a star, but I never became a train.
Straight Katana blades. So gross.
1:05 people.¬†

Not all people who like anime are total weaboos. If you think anyone is automatically a weaboo for simply liking anime, then you're just a naive fuck. Grow the fuck up, and respect the taste of others.
My favorite Animes are that's so raven, Thomas the tank engine, He man, and those airplane instruction videos
I agree.
Weeabos need a fken life, get a damn girl, stop watching h3nta! and fking pillows in your parents house, that guy had naked anime gurls everywhere. I personally love anime but you guys are sick b4st4rds, fken baakas look mad ugly in there costumes with there fat a5$es holding katanas and bokkens. You don't speak japenese with your fake a5$ accents and pitch
What is the realm 900 music?
HAHAHA OMG this is great. c: well done sir.
So glad I grew out of it... I recognise way too many things in this video that I used to do heh
he said "I have two Jew in my Closet""thy're both dead"
as shocking as this is... and those otaku's and weeaboos may be sooo surprised by this but...



JAPANESE PEOPLE DONT EVEN WATCH ANIME A LOT!!!! WUUTTT WOW THE MORE YOU KNOW BAM SHAMA LAMA MOO MOO! boom... you're educated... yep, Japanese people dont even watch it much. most do not watch it at all, guess what, the things that come from "Japan" like anime, and collectable anime crap is all just, and you've guessed it! TO ATTRACT TOURISTS! the most popular "Anime" you will find people like in Japan, are Studio Ghibli movies...
I'm a weeaboo.
Say what you need to say, I'm prepared.
Yea everywhere
"I AM SURE READY" tHER ARE TWO WEABOOS IN MY CLOSET"
is this legit Japanese
The subtitles on the japanese parts had me weak because they were not really what he even said and majority of you all probably believe the subs were actually translating what he said...
gosh darn WEEABOOS!!!!
i always wanted to be hannah montana. ;-; dreemz dunt cum tru
'One thing about anime'
rekt
Is this the guy who voiced Alfe on Problem Solvers?
Dude I learned how to fight from anime jk I think anime's gay
Please notice me idol
if your avatar is anime or MLP, go fuck yourself.
so I watch anime but not like full on people in the weeaboo son does this make me a weeaboo
what's wrong with having an interest and fascination in someone else's culture? I for one love Japanese culture and all Asian culture tbh it really intrigues me, and I would love to backpack/live in Asia one day. Whats so bad about that? Surely it's good that people are exploring other cultures?
Weaboo jones VS indinia jones
Subtitles:
Are you ready to have some fun? I sure am!

Actual translation:
There are two Jews in my closet...they're both dead.
THIS IS BRILLIANT
My fauvorite anime is Fox News

Franku you can talk about everything. We watch ur vids because ur the coolest guy ever.
The pigeon is a spy
Some times I watch anime series. A lot of times I'll come across ones that are really fucked up and I don't watch to keep my sanity in check. One show was about a guy who fights demons and he got his powers from sucking milk out of the tits of well-endowed women.
hallo my name is cowboy hanaka, lmfao i'm fucking crying
"If you're just someone who really likes anime, you're fine"
Me: OH THANK GOD
r-r-rashingan.. r-rosetta stone...
Why is everyone who likes anime complaining? Go to 0:41
Was he being serious when he said he was 52??? He looks no where near 50 at all...
I like anime but not swords and shit
4:12 That impression is spot on
There's a difference between a weaboo and somebody who just watches anime but for some reason its still annoying when an anime watcher calls another anime watcher a weab lel
I like his anime boy impression lol.. yeah fucking annoying anime boy talks...
I knew this one weeaboo in highschool who would always run around in a naruto jacket. He/she still does it in college.
WEARING A KATANA IN JAPAN IS FORBIDDEN SINCE 188 I DONT FUCKING KNOW
Holy tits frank is 52?
BUT SOUL EATER
:l
His pronunciation of Japanese is soooooo perfect.
Franku-Sama should be a VA, he speaks moon runes pretty tight.
I may be a nerd for anime, games, old movies and cartoons, but looking at those photos makes me cringe up a lot.
Anime is just like evry other type of entertainment; there's good and there's bad. It's kind of silly to think all of it is a gift from god, or all of it is creepy bullshit.

Personally, I watch stuff based on its merits of quality and effort, be it animated or live-action(godIhatethatterm but it applies here I guess); western or eastern.

tl;dr, judge something based on its merits, not its medium.


With that said, I still think weeaboos are fucking weird.


EDIT: jebus christ,those pictures at the end are cringe-worthy.

eeeech.
Nuff said.
NO WAIFU NO LIFU MUTHAFUCKERS
SPIDERMAN IS MY WAIFU
japanophile lol
Anime sucks












c: let it begin
"Are you ready to have some fun?" - I have a feeling that u didn't said that. It heard more like connected to my ( the listener's) toilet, some people, and playing.
well, I kinda under stand why my friend sent me to this video now.... FUCK IT, I DON'T CARE IF I'M A WEEABOO, AND I DON'T CARE THAT I'M Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÄÄ„Åò„ÇÉ„Å™„ÅÑ„ÄÅ„ÄÄI'M LEARNING KENDO AND I PLAN ON HAVING A SWORD COLLECTION WHEN I MOVE TO JAPAN... AND ONE PIECE IS BETTER THAN NARUTO, ALL YOU NARUTARDS CAN SUCK A JUICY FAT ONE!






I apologize for my vulgar language
'get the fuck out, this is my house' xD
Don't forget fnaf.
I am just a normal otaku
Wait, is there actually a problem with having some weapons like katanas and wearing kimonos? Or with loving Japanese culture? Aside from the weeaboo type of love for Japanese culture. shudder
Liberty Kids was a way better anime then Cory in The House
5:15 he wanted to laugh
I watch anime, but i'm not like that. I just watch it. Only words I know in Japanese is "hi" "sorry" and "thank you" that's it. I thought this video was hilarious.
Wait? Franky. Are you telling me all these things aren't true? NOOOOOOOOOOOO
This is so fucking true. Also:
"I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass...I just wanted a piece of the helicopters ass"

CORY. IN. THE. HOUSE. BEST ANIME 2015
Weeaboos, full of them in my school..
This is......quite funny lol.
hahaha.
WHAT THE FUYCK IM NOT A WEEABOO, YUKI~
6:53
Pigeon stories.
lmao
Japanese at the beginning he says: Welcome to the filthy frank show. I've got two foreigners in my closet. They're both gonna die.
But maybe they SHOULD talk like that!
I don't really care about what kind of fandom something attracts, Naruto/Naruto Shippuuden (without the fillers ofc) actually is a great series I can recommend to anyone who's looking for a deep, moving and inspiring story.

It's kinda like Lord of the Rings with more profound philosophy and a japanese setting :)
"6 anime series"
fucking casuals
It's even more ironic when the Youtube comments are worst than every community in every aspect of the entertainment industry combined, i mean they are people with branches constantly stuck up in their asses typing rigorously on their keyboard
Papa Franku was right!
The weeaboos DID invade!
They're breaking down the mental retardation shields!
HELP!
HEEELP!
SEND REINFORCEMENTS!!
I like Videogames a lot
Man, dis vid...
Great vid 10/boku no pico
Hahahahahahahaha he couldn't say he wanted a piece of percy's ass without laughing hahahahahahahahahaha

Fucking 0:20, I'm laughing so hard I almost pissed myself.
This video's looking promising.
this was great, don't get me wrong i love anime... just hate weaboos like Hannah minx, people say shes got a good pair i say its nasty as with her face.
omg I couldn't stop fuckn laughing.
haha what did i just watch???
I hate getting called a weeaboo. Most of my interests may have a lot to do with Japan but I don't go around denouncing America or it's culture, in fact most of my favorite TV shows/movies are american made.
A quick test, mark with x:

1.[x] Frank is totally awesome or fucking insane (or both)!
2.[x] His neighbors are completely deaf or dead
3.[x] His Japanese voice is clear like water rather than His harsh engrish
4.[ ] Nobody will read this shit and cares.
5.[ ] Is the third prime number and the fifth Fibonacci number.

I love anime but I'm not a weeaboo. I don't wish I was Japanese, I just wish I wasn't American, it's boring.
Lololo Corey in the house
Csgo is weeaboo central
Breathes heavily
I know a lot of people are saying Weaboo's are annoying and most of you are right, but you people are annoying too. When someone picks up a manga, you instantly label them as a Weaboo. When someone goes to animecon or any con for that matter dressed as an anime character, instant weaboo label. Like wtf, you guys say that weaboo's scare any new anime fans coming in, but in actuality, it's you people who label yourselves as 'anime fans just no weaboos' that scare the new anime/manga fans. People ask a movie start to sign their baby, nothing weird about that. People buy a sword that looks identical to an anime sword. Their fkn weaboos. GTFO you guys suck.
Cory is my waifu.
OH MY GOD¬†
Cory In The House is my favorite anime too.
We have so much in common.
Wtf how i come here!?O.o
The Humble Bundle weekly is currently having a Weeaboo Starting Kit bundle, for just 35 bucks you'll get all the Anime virgin games AND one of those fucked up hentai pillows. You're welcome, Faggots
I was a weeaboo when I was little, but then I grew a brain.
I hate weeaboos, I like anime but, I can't keep up a decent conversation with them before they bring up something Japanese
We need now a video about bronies. Before you start hating on me, I have no problem on people watching 3yr old cartoons, just dont fucking publish it on every fucking social media nor bring that shit near me.
I think what we really need to appreciate here... Is the fact that anyone can be a weeaboo, being a weeaboo is something anyone from any ethnic race can be.
Weeaboos make me cringe, but they have never reached 5% of the cringe levels that this guy made me feel in this video. I can't pin down exactly why though. Probably the weird costumes and the way he talks and acts ... and everything, oh dear.
YOU KNOW NOTHING OF ANIME I'M MORE JAPANEESE THAN YOU (EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT JAPANEESE) *******HEAVY BREATHING*****
Annnnnnnnnnnnd someone has issues O_o
ok i like anime but this made me laugh way too much
I find this hilarious. I talked about getting a katana, and I was getting called a weeaboo... I happen to be japanese, and technically i cant be called a weeaboo! HAHAHA
god bless you
I have a joke for you all alrighys lets do this 

How many weaboos does it take to screw a japanese lightbulb?

over 9000 because theres no english subtitles. 

im leaving now
I just love enslaved nigger pussy that work at my cotton fields. They just beg for that dick. MHMMMMMM
My favorite anime is Futabu.
Can someone turn 3:29 into a gif.
This gave me the best type of Ebola

Filthy Frank never fails to make me piss myself laughing!
He's got it right!
A lot of Weeaboos, even some non-Japanese Otaku, are really disrespectful to Japanese culture by declaring it as a huge 'Kawaii state' and thinking that life over there is exactly like how it is in their Shoujo anime.
IT'S A REAL COUNTRY - WITH REAL PROBLEMS - LIKE EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD.

I've been studying Japanese language for a few years now, but I still have found no interest in watching Anime or reading Manga. A lot of people say to me,
"So, duuuh, how did you start learning Japanese uuuh, cuz I really want to watch Gekkan Shoujo without subtitles shneff schneff"

I'm learning because I'm a software developer and games designer and I want to work in Japan <.>
FUCK.
Thanks for the exact information. I was curious what the hell is the weeaboo means. And I think I'm not a weeaboo. Maki at 10:20 anyway
8:21 FUCK U! XD
8:03 just got a boner :>
This vid is the best thing ive seen in some time (btw your damsel in distress cute anime girl voice is awesome XD)
Hilarious as always Mr. Frank the Filthy
I want a filthy frank body pillow. All I do is cry and mastrubate

You must have a sore throat buddy ._.
I want your world to be real.
750 weeaboos confirmed
I heard that there was an anime an it was autistic and died.
CORY IN THE HOUSEE
Is weeaboo hate trending these days? Thank fuck I'm actually Japanese, I can enjoy what I like without being branded and hated by the internet. :3
Oh who am I kidding. I'm sure the internet will find some way of hating someone with different interests to them :(
I just itched by gooch
he's, like, the parody of annoying...
he sounds actually sounds attractive when he's speaking japanese
the real moral of the story is:

please, what's the name of the arabic song playing around 7:48
Franks right. 13 year old is BORDERLINE pedophile. Cause it's called Hebephilia. A form of Chronophilia. Now debate. Faggots.
The weeaboo song is actually really good XD
Ok, doctor, I am activating the beckon to attract ALL weeaboos. I have one thing to say... if you like hentai, people probably hate you. Someone, help me with the operation! I can't do this myself, I NEED to gather them... and end this war... I... can hear them... breathing heavily and typing really fast... OH GOD NO!!
Want to form a vigilante group spanning the world wherein we hunt down and "remove" weeaboos?
gg
i get you man,i get you. i hate every one too, every one
whoa... his Japanese accents actually seem pretty good xD
I believe this to be the greatest video ever made.
I have probably watched this more times than any other video on YouTube
b0ss halp me, I don't habe life
I'm learning japanese in order to understand what asa akira is shouting in her videos.
I'm a weaboo ?
I like it how weeabos are now discussing if they are weebs or not with their anime profile pic and LOLICONLOVER2332 username
yes you are a weeaboo you fucking loser, get over it

wow get a good taste in anime fag everyone knows pawn stars is the best anime
What did I just watch.
Fuck Anime :^)
I think we need a weeaboo exchange program. Send weeaboos to japan and have them treated like otakus are.
I'm already dying laughing at "W-w-where are the subtitles."
What is a "weeaboo"?

Yo i hate weeaboos they need to calm the fuck down i watch anime cause im half asain and 12 like bruh and i hate how people say i have no life watching anime just saying the truth people and im sorry i this is offensive to other people....
Cory in the House mentioned
you are the hero we need
Offense to every fat weeaboo bastard. Weeaboos are basically FUCKING DUMBASS CUNTS that think they're always right. If you fuck with their anime the will breath so hard and pound the fucking keys on their keyboard so hard their man tits will flop up and down revealing the slime in between the rolls from no hygiene. Honestly, people won't offend those fat bastards because they don't want to hear they're bitching. But I checked my wallet, and I have no fucks to give. BRING IT ON YOU FAT ASS ANIME LOVING BASTARDS 'MERICA
lost it at "cowboy tanaka"
Okey.
So If i put Hei mask of Chinese Electric Batman on yourself, wear black clothes and jack, take 2 big knives, electro shoker and fising line, and walk through people with calm ¬†behavior and sometimes run for one of those people to try tie them and stuck with shoker...
I am WEEABOO?
I like anime but I have friends and shower every day, I'm not fat, I exercise and eat healthy. I also have other hobbies, like drawing and gaming.

You should definitely do a video on furries. They also are cancerous, and deserve a video.

this video is perfect for my daily dose of filthy frank
I'm not weeabo cos I'm asian and those stuff that happens in slice of life animes happens to my school :P

Katanas are good for killing zombies.
honestly i find chop sticks a supirior eating tool
i have a question please reply TVFilthyFrank,
Am i a weeaboo? I am asian because my grandma is tai and her mother is japanese (so that makes me like 2% japanese or something) i love anime but its not my TOP,EVRYTHING,LOVE im more intrested in things like Marble Hornets,Creepypasta,South Park,Ms.Petagerie's home for piculer children or anything scary or cute. Im also a gamer but im not a 24-7 gamer i play video games on my free time mostly im caching up on the newest scary stories or south park and stuff like that. I am learning japanese so i can visit my grandmother's mother for the first time (but she only knows japanese and tai). But i love anime. Dose this make me a weeaboo? (sorry for my bad speling i have a stupid computer with a few keys that are a pain to press and ive been in forgin countrys alot so i forgot my sence of typing amrican)
Yes I like anime. Yes I like the Japanese culture. Yes I want to/am working on learning Japanese. Yes I want katanas. Not just to have them but to actually use them. No I'm not s weeaboo. Filthy Frank keep up the good work! You are a  beautiful man!!
why do you do that annoying voice? the vid would be perfect if you didn't try so hard to sound "funny" or whatever
Filthy frank is chinese, and speaks chinese, and has a anime picture as his profile of himself hipocrit weeaboo
lol jk this is awesome
my favourite japanese anime is american dad
atteck on teten is good animu >:^(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
At least I don't have an anime avatar anymore.......
I have 2 men in my closet. They are both dead.¬†


ok
i approve
how to disarm a weeaboo slap or logic such as "i dont like school girl anime" * 3 weeaboos go down crying* ive studied japanese culture and no one has carried a katana since the end of the sengoku era 45 weeaboos go down after a heart attack ¬†there are more than just anime in japan 60 weeaboos heads explode from hearing "more than anime in japan" ¬†and my favorite there are numerous versions of one word in japan such as hello stop good bye and so on you would fuck up in no time fast * remaining weeaboos vanish from existence*
omg those weeaboos are some silent hill shit
haha 52 <3 frank
Weeaboo is just a nonsense word thought up by the Perry Bible web comic. When going to their face book they say it means I love you. Why you telling lies?
Meatspin problems video

Herro my name  is a cow boy croka
School Days is the best anime ever.¬† cackles evilly
Hi my name is Bob Franklin ( All of my friends call me by my true Japanese name Hashimaota Ramen-Senpai) and I watch anime whenever no one is around. I have been masturbating to korean cartoons for over 3 years now, my senses have been overloaded and I can no longer feel attraction to real women. I listen to Japanese music like Bo en and Tomggg I say that I like the music because it's good, but in reality I fucking hate it but I listen to it because it is Japanese. Is there any hope left for me? Please if anyone can help me find a therapist contact me immediately.
Ur voice is kinda good in japanese
I found this video funny and not at all offensive xD, not even when people sent it to me because of that fact that I like anime lmao. I know I'm not a weeabo, and I fully understand the definition of it, so why should anyone who's in the same boat get offended? If you know you're not what he described or what others describe, and you just like anime and respect the Japanese culture as well as your own and everyone else's, why should you care what others have to say haha
Just ignore them and move on.
watch the new episode of Tokyo Ghoul.
This explains the high suicide rates in Japan.
You do make good points, but someone can have a healthy respect of a culture, speak the language, and watch anime without being a weeaboo. But some people take it way too fucking far. I'm half Japanese, so I've seen both ends of the spectrum. I've seen people who want to be Japanese, speak the most butchered Japanese out there (Koh-nee-chee-wah. That's so kah-wah-ee. So suh-goo-i. So deh-soo. KYAAA for example), wear nothing but anime shirts, think ONLY japanese guys are cute, and think that everything that is Japanese is the holy grail of everything out there and if its not Japanese, or you don't agree that its so 'soo-goo-i' then you are the most evil person on the planet. But there's also people who are so fucking racist, that they will use any word to bring you down. You don't put down a black person because they're speaking English and not an African language. You don't hate someone because they're listening to Gangnam Style and not Sweet Home Alabama. And you don't pick on some stranger because they're watching pokemon. You can have a healthy interest of a culture, but some do take it way too far. IDK how many times people have branded me a 'white person trying to be Asian/Japanese because I listen to J/Kpop, eat pocky, and speak Japanese. And completely ignore the fact that im half japanese. Cause I fucking hate anime. I think if you are a quarter Japanese(AT THE LEAST) then you have a right to be more interested than what is typically normal, but above that would just be weird. So I just ask that while I respect you expanding your horizons past your own culture, please keep the obsession to a minimum around me. IDC if i am so 'sugoi' because im half and can speak japanese. Save it for your otaku friends. America has big problems, but i assure you that Japan does too. Not everyone thinks Japan is perfect and holy like you do.
We all know those people in the comments that use the ducking text emojis. With their anime girl icons even though they are guys. The only reason why my profile pic is anime is because I'm too lazy to take a selfie.
so funny
I fucking dare you. Sniffs.
ey b0ss
Oh god, I must change my avatar...lol naw. You're hilarious though! I can't breath! xD
Corn
Love you frank
OH MY GOD >.< You are so funny ! Just Subbed <3 XDDD
It is funny to see all the butthurt weaboos and pony fags defend the fandom's they are in when they know that both are full of autism.
As a martial artist, I hate it when all the weeaboo retards say "jutsu." I mean, sure, the Japanese word for art translates to spell it that way, but it's pronounced "jitsu."
things i hate:
bronys
weeaboos
swagfags¬†
and the list go's on...
I wish my dad didn't abandon me.
my fav anime is thomas the dank engine
150% serious I can smell cigarette smoke from the other side of my monitor.
Edit: No this isn't meant as hate. I legitimately smelled cigarette smoke when I started watching. Probably a coincidence.
Omg weaboo Jones is HILARIOUS! XD I just died of laughter around 7:44
Too funny XD
Salamander makes me most :3
nigger ¬†s
this nigga looks mexican
My favorite anime is toy story too omg high fayb bru

i do it because im a self ritous faggot
gay
can u talk normal? now you are giving me a headache
I'm a hafu and I have this creepy weeaboo perv who keeps touching my hand when I tell him to stop. He keeps asking me out and is a fucking creep! He keeps mispronouncing my surname and words from my language!!! Can someone please tell me how to get him to leave me alone?!? It's really creeping me out!!!
My favourite anime is Angela anaconda
I've waited so long for this video you have no idea.
what does yamatae mean?
Most likely spelled that wrong
"BAKKA! DAMEH!! DONT MAKE FUN OF US WEABOO".... lmaooooo this is hilarious lol. before this i didnt know they were called weaboos, but after whatching this video I see them like everywhere :o there were some weaboos in 21 Jump Street?? :o
I'm a weeaboo. Not ashamed XD
good to know that two jews are in your closet. and both are dead. üëçüëçüëå kussotare... what? who said that.
My favorite anime is Two and a Half Men. The plot is really well thought out.
I like Anime....But i shower frequently, Also most anime sucks. Most Anime to me is like Girlchan in paradise.
best part of the video is right at the end when hes like "peace bitches im out" then he turns around, hits a wall, and then just stops walking
Weaboos be like, "this video doesn't apply to me."
Dont talk shit about my anumee
Well I would like Japanese weapons because I have an interest in Japanese history and I would like to study it in Japan.
im a weaboo

Lmao man so fucking funny
Where do you get all these images? How do you google that? lol

I love how 2/3 of the commenters have anime profile pics.
52 Years? No way this is legit. Lemme check that twitter.
XD, i fkin love this guy, omfg
*heavy breathing*
I'll fuck you up.
Why do those faggots even use/collect katanas?
The British Longsword & Longbow are superior.
The amazing British weabu protection centre a concrete building lined with pictures of the queen  with bangers and mash for dinner full english breakfast and fish and chips for tea with the wake being made of tv's constantly playing doctor who. Oh and also we have tea instead of water
I feel sad for those people, the infection spread to far and it was too late for them. It's really sad though.
Lol I watch anime and I'm laughing.
This guy is hilarious... Lol
My favourite anime is Saved by the Bell
I need this channel...i just...need it
I'm an anime fan but it annoys me when others have to bash people for not liking Anime, or when they bash people who say it's a cartoon when it's the same thing, IF PEOPLE DONT LIKE ANIME LEAVE THEM BE! ANIME IS NOT PERFECT!
b0ss im a train pls
is iT BAD THAT I WAS WatCHING THIS WITH MY KaTANA

im japanese :D IM NOT A WEEABOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lol the fuckn subtitles man!
Quit watchin ur goddamn gook toons
I don't know why this just popped up in my suggestions, but this is great. I can hardly breathe, this is hilarious. Also, as a cosplayer and fan of anime/other japanese culture, I can't even tell you how spot on this is. I can't say I didn't go through a slight weaboo phase, but I snapped out of it quick and realized how idiotic these people are. Plus, they are EXTREMELY uncomfortable to be around. Anime clubs and conventions are such dangerous places to be. And don't even get me started on the weaboo artists. I appreciate anime styled art very much, but when you come across certain people that try to replicate their favorite manga and tell you their sad mixture of Yugi and Sailor Moon with stiff, stick thin limbs and straw hair with eyes bigger than their hands is the epitome of artistic talent? That's when it just gets to be too much for me. A+ on this though, man. I don't know who you are, but I am gladly subscribing.

i love chinese cartoons!
the way weaboo jones walks is just so fucking creepy
I swear to God that this video should be flagged
4:09 That's exactly how anime voice actors sound though xD
6:00 until the end of the video is the one of the best fucking things that could happen in YouTube.
Are we never getting a Joji album anymore?
The only Japanese i know is the stuff you've taught me.
I fucking lost it at cory in the house.
I can practically hear their heavy breathing and the aggressive typing on the keyboards
Lol
Elfien lied was shit
Is no one going to comment on the joke "What do you call a white girl who can run faster than her brothers? A redneck virgin."?
I want to learn Japanese so I can play fucking Macross 30 because there's no english release.
That doesn't make me a weaboo, does it?¬† :S
U wot m8
Did I just see a Conniver's Kunai?

What kind of weeaboo learns Japanese from Rosetta Stone, uhh.. you learn it from watching so much anime duh... gosh it's like you don't even know what a weeaboo is.¬†








That's what I'm doing, ;)
at 3:53 when he's talking about the pigeon, does he actually say this is my house?
6:19
oh god the ANIME CLUB AT MY SCHOOL CIRCLE PRAYER FOR THEM O JEBUS
I want to see this man lose his shit laughing.
"I only watch anime for plot"
omg
Rokudenashi is the biggest Weeaboo. He disabled replies to his comment on this vid, blocks meh, and calls me a nigga cuz he try to fit in with the cool kids. Watch out for this insecure mother.
7:56 there is no words that can describe how much I'm laughing right now
Those effects tho
This guy is FUCKING HALIROUS im subscribing and can I plz have the full song
KONICHIWA YOU MAGNEFICIENT BASTARDS!!!
Didn't know Seinfeld was an Anime
I have some stanky weaboos in my school... They think they are smarter than ever one else
I knew this girl who looked like the one at I think 9:48 or something like that just skip through the video it's the fat girl
I never thought I would find somebody who hates weeaboos more than me...but here you are
At the risk of getting 'Sandstormed' does anybody know the gypsy-sounding cello song that's played when he's in the weeaboo protection chamber?
OH MY FUCKING GOD, YOU'RE 52 YEARS OLD???? BULLSHIT!!! O.O
That voice tho...
Do you mind if I watch some tentacle hentai now and then?
Drop the stupid swords and buy a shotgun instead.
you know for an anime community i'm happy they can make fun of themselves at times
lol what the hell.
That Inuyasha has about three chins too many to accurately portray the character.
Weeaboos are an equivalent of homosexuals in San Francisco and those weeaboos need to stop jacking off to Japanese culture.
I think it's hilarious how weeaboos complain about English dubs being inferior to Japanese dubs like they're experts when it comes to voice acting. Most of them are probably too shy to even carry their voice across a mic.
i like how sometimes hell laugh after he says something funny
it makes it even funnier
You're Japanese is too MLG M8
anime is disgusting and ugly anyone who watches it is gross lonely faggot
plz do some anime as a voice actor
There is a kid in my 1st hour, trying to make weeaboo cool...
9:00 Melon-pan is NOT a weaboo. Waaaay far from it.
"eyes this big" more like tits
You earn yourself a sub. I feel a sadness in my breasts that there are more people who call cartoon childish when it clearly not. I not a fan of anime, but it would be nice to talk to people who are into 1960-1990s cartoons with me. Its all "Anime this, anime that!" I miss the 90s. :(
Oh god i think you broke my face with all the cringing
My favorite anime was Battleblock Theather, Castle Crashers and most important TF2 comic Stories
Anime Is For Fags That Are Nerds.

This is the funniest video I've seen in ages. Subscribed
I like anime, but don't suck its dick like a whore, and I want to visit Japan. Not for the same reason as a weeaboo, but like every other terrorist.
Ive watched this so many times
This has changed my life.
The weeaboos.. Pls de pusi
Someone I know is basically a replica of weeaboo Jones
Birds are not important.

6:30 he doesn't say "we gotta run" he actually says "I love pussy" Omg filthy frank is joking around with people who don't speak japanese good job frank
I get weeabos are a tad bit annoying, but honestly, if a lot of people were obsessed with my culture or loved it, I would be thrilled, not rant about people who appreciate it. :P
Omg! He translated 0.10 wrong! He said "Did u know that i have 2 jewish people in my closet? Well they're both dead" wow, I understand japanese so I got what he said!
Fuckin idjuts. You don't call anime chinese cartoons


You call em Taiwanese moving pictures. Get it right
Hahaha!!!
Well anime is pretty terrible, it's like watching a slide show of mouth flaps.
When I first watched this a long time ago, it only had 200,000 views, what the hell happened?
Weeaboo Cunts
You kids and your made up 4chan words :3

All profile pictures should be made in MSPaint.
YEA FUCK CHINA WOOO

Attack on Titan sucks
i wanna see a five nights at Freddy's clone called five nights at weaboo's
oh f*ck
7:55 me in a bullet hell game
Weaboos are fucking gross tbh
Bronies plz
we have Weeaboos in the car scene, i think the closes thing too them is Ricers... JDM AZ FUK MAHN! they think they are Japanese because they drive a Honda Civic, say Corvette and they crap bricks because nothing is better than a Subaru WRX STI, you can enjoy the japanese cars without being a ricer, but once you have neon lights, a spoiler, and a hood scoop that just sticks too your fake carbon fiber hood and performs no real function, on your stock Honda Civic you are probably Rice.
i would watch your shit more if your voice wasnt like that
I have tried to learn Japanese off of the anime but I gave up and started watching the dubbed anime
·Éê·Éú·Éò·Éõ·Éî ·Éõ·É£·Éö·É¢·É§·Éò·Éö·Éõ·Éò·Éê ! ·Éù·É¢·Éê·Éô·É£·Éî·Éë·Éò ·Éß·Éö·Éî·Éî·Éë·Éò ·Éê·É†·Éò·Éê·Éú !
<3
Oh man, I just got into it on a Fate/Stay Night vid by calling Rin Tohsaka a bitch; so, yeah weeaboos are annoying as fuck!
This guy's identity is an enigma.
OH GOD THESE COMMENTS
I LOVE THEM
SUCH SALTY TEARS
Lol, he sound like Natsu in the "mocking anime voices" part. (Inb4 people spam me with messages saying I'm a weeaboo)
You need to invest in some soundproofing
4:50

"Cuz you know I get all the pussy, and it is scrump-diddly-umptious!"
Having a anime avatar doesn't necessarily mean you're a weeaboo, right? right?
All the weeaboo butthurt on the comments is so delicious!
4:34 I'm a girl, I'm Asian, and I don't sound like that. I have a pretty low girl voice, one that's close to androgynous. You're right.
Gomenasai, my name is Ken-Sama
I'm a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)

I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.

I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%

When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!

I own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.
But not as sad as a fucking weeaboo! Lol too funny!
I have a question that needs an answer, is he japanese?
Stop talking about anime like this. :3 My favorite show is Attack On Titan, and I like it for a good reason. There's a reason why it's popular. This channel is shit along with all its fans.
I always thought weaboos were those fayygs who would use japanese honorifics amongst there friends like san,chan and sheshwan and not use it jokingly but use it like they dead ass.
This is pretty funny. I don't like being called a weeaboo because
1. I have respect for all cultures and languages 
2. I am learning japanese, but not through anime
3.  As much as I love Japan, I still love America(despite the fact that some people in this country are assholes)
4. I actually don't watch anime often

I also see being called a weeaboo the same way as the japanese see the term "otaku"
Lol Christian Weston Chandler.
Did I see CWC in there at the end?
also press 6 for best bit
OMFG the weeaboos... The weeaboos are heavy breathing again üòè
before i got to MCM or any other convention i watch this to rememember what to avoid
Don't worry Frank Its me Harold from Thomas The Train you can have my ass any time you want ;)
Yeah you know i watch that shit, bra.
Spongebob is best anime
My fave Anime is The Beatles
"Anime was a mistake." - Hayao Miyazaki.
Yeah, anyone who likes anime is a straight up nerd! Especially NARUTO, that anime is top tier garbage!
Still waiting for a video where you mess with emos. Because we all know they deserve more crap than weeaboos do
People get offended if their race is shit on, and people making white jokes makes me laugh my ass off, I love them. (Im white)
Not everyone who watches anime is a weeaboo. I mean I enjoy anime and I talk about it a lot, and that doesn't make me a weeaboo. A weeaboo is someone who literally cannot stop, weeaboos go way to overboard and have a crazy obsession with these types of things and try to mock them as if it were their own culture. Weeaboos are annoying though, they act as if they know everything there is to know about anime and Japan and will try to mock it and be of that culture in any way shape or form when they aren't.
who shoved a good old rosetta stone up your ass ya feel me?
In your ball sack they smell bad they're disgusting
Is it bad that I want to go to japan just to learn the culture?
My favorite anime is Cory In The House.
harro my name isu.... cowboy tanaka
Pure genious! ahahaha so sick!
You can tell Frank is a huge naruto fan though dont deny it!
I like anime and my brother calls me a weeboo....least I'm not a wannabe redneck...
Filthy Frank Show is my favorite anime cartoon actualy
cory in da house
whats the song at 2:56
Anime sucks!!! webobbobos are lifeless fuckers!!
6:56 best part hey b0ss
I sure love my North Korean comic shorts.
There was a guy in my graphics class and he set his wallpaper to change every so often and every damn picture was some anime chick with huge boobs and she looked like she was 12. And I shit you not I never saw the same picture twice. I was in a class with this guy for 5 months. He even had a katana collection which he seemed to talk about a lot.
Who's more annoying? Feminists or Weeaboos? That's a tough one.

I think I know the person at 9:20.

She's a cunt.
I will give you all of obama's money if you do a video on bronies
Only things I have in common with a weeaboo
.I have a manga collection (death note and black butler)
.I have
WEEB LIFE
Omg! I'm dynig!!! X'DDDDDD¬†
Nyeesss!
As someone who enjoys watching anime I can say I was really disgusted at those people in the end of the video.....people that idolize 2D girls need to sort themselves out. I can get over posters of fav characters and stuff but the pillows and trying to pretend there your girlfriend is out of line.......
My friend watches anime and collects swords, but he's not a douche about it.
LMFAO!
Just saying, but what's bad about having an anime avatar picture?
i like anime but i¬†laughed so hard! u got my sub :D
anime sucks
"do you wanna see my katana collection"? hahahahah
dexter is my favorite anime
please b0ss make a video telling everyone to stop calling each other weeaboos. since this video came out i try to look at some funny comments and all i see is "you're fucking weeaboo trash"
Ey B0ss!
My favorite anime is also Cory in the House
This video is honest.
ey big man reet good post ya cunt all these weebs tokking pish get on mee heed son....
The fucking recorderüòÇ

Everyone else: NOPE!
Me: I see...
1st video I have watched from you and already you have my 100% respect....having been talking about those types of people for years now. Have been lucky to avoid them for the most part so eh..but my god those pictures o_o I didn't know shit was that bad...
hahahahahhahahaI LOVE IT!
fuckin subbed
How to start a fight!
Anime sucks!
Wait...
Personally, my favorite anime is south park.
He'd be a great voice actor.
+TVFilthyFrank¬†If you haven't already, you need to make a video about bronies. Those bodrerline pedophile retards would probably be up in arms about it too.
atook on tootan
God I love those animes. my favorite Anime has to be king of the hill
XD I have a dream of moving to Japan one day and make manga or be an english teacher I dont know. But honestly I know guys who are so obsessed with Japan that theyll get mad if anyone tells them that they're being stupid. "Why Are You Insulting My Culture! You American!"...yeah those type. I mean when I move to Japan (if it ever happens) I know for sure that the first thing I'm going to tell them it's that I'm obviously not from here and that if they wish to call me Gaijin go ahead I won't give too much of a fuck.
Anime sucks!
I lost it at Cory in the house
U R SOOOOOO RIGHT ABOUT THE DISSING ANIME AND THEN THE BASHING, THE 6 ANIME THINKING U NO STUFF, THE VOICES, THE KATANA ON THE TRAIN, WEABOOS R SO MEAN WORST FANDOM EVER lol i make a comment and they are all like NFJDSLOGNKLJSNG,
Amine is brainwash end of story
the fuck is up with this niggas voice
Filthy Frank is awesome.Truth exposed, deal with it.
I think we all need a picture of Cowboy Tanaka
Holy fuck he was right, everyone in the comments have anime characters as their profile pictures....
Make fun of bronies.
–Ø–ø–æ–æ–æ~–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π
I've been called a weeaboo before... I don't mind though. Also... This video is both disturbing, and hilarious xD SUBSCRIBED! =D
I find it funny that the majority of profile pics are anime
LMAO frank himself is weeaboo fuck. he's only half Japanese. he will never get treated like a full Japanese in his own country !!! LMAO xDDDDD
First Ill have to get a job....

Lol. I hate this guy, i hate this guy.

Keep it going!
Wait is frank 52 ¬†O-o i swear he looks like 26 >.>
Basically everyone who watches anime goes through the weeaboo stage, now, this is a very minor version of weeaboo (ex. Saying Kawaii or calling themselves an otaku) after a while they may see how silly they look and cut the act. However, those who don't escape become the shit stain of anime fans. Practicing jutsu like it will actually help them one day, running Naruto style, speaking broken Japanese, memorizing the lyrics to the theme song of every anime they've watched, and judging people for watching "mainstream anime". These people should be avoided at all costs.
My favorite anime is Shrek.
I love cowboy Tanaka, I need a cowboy Tanaka in my live.
Hey man
Cosplay is still ok
Weeaboos aren't ofc
If youre interested in samurais and all that sweet ass japanese history like i am, are you a weeaboo then?
PS. i mean just interested not obsessed
Tbh you're the fucking best man, I can't even stop laughing at your shit. This is the most random, disgusting, poorly edited stuff, but so funny bruh.
I never really laugh at videos of people who are trying to be funny  
But this guy did not fail , I'm crying of how hard I laughed because this is so funny and true xD
do one on bronies!
whispers Rosetta Stone xD
I hate anime








:)

HELP, I HAVE CAUGHT THE¬†DISEASE KNOWN AS WEEABOOISM. I HAVE ORDERED 3 THROWING STARS FROM SOME SHADEY WEBSITE AND MY GIRLFRIEND WORRIES ABOUT ME. CALL HELP FOR HELP NOW!!! I AM SLOWLY STARTING TO GROW A NECK BEARD AND I CAN FEEL MY DICK SHRINKING TO THE SIZE OF AN ACORN. I AM STARTING TO GAIN WEIGHT AND ARGUE WITH PEOPLE ON REDDIT ABOUT THE JAPANESE CULTURE. ALSO I CHANGED MY NAME TO FIT SOMETHING TO FIT MY AUTISM AND MY PICTURE IS NOW OF MY WAIFU. I DO NOTHING ALL DAY BUT RUB MY DICK TO ANIME GIRLS AND SMELL REALLY BAD. I THINK IT MIGHT BE TOO LATE BUT I KNOW THAT THERE IS A SLIM CHANCE OF ME SURVIVING. CALL FOR HELP NOW, I REPEAT CALL FOR HELP NOW!!!!
This is why I put this Character as my avatar.
My favorite anime is Rosetta Stone.
Cory in the House is a really good anime but I prefer the manga.

Being a Weeaboo is like playing Guitar Hero on the easiet difficulty, then going around and telling people you play actual guitar.
subscribing to this awesome guy XD
Do one on horse fuckers
Hello weeaboos :3 I'm a hip hop dancer, but really like to dance to that "kawaii" vocaloid stuff. idky but it's been hard finding some music lately r_r If you comment some songs on here that would be great! ^0^

And....subcribe
Thats my bestfriend at 9:58 with the asuna body pillow lol
As funny as this video is, i kinda wish it wasn't here, cause every time i try to see some funny comments on these vids all i see is weeaboo trash, like shit I'm trying to find some humour and just because half these people have anime pictures all I see is weeaboo weeaboo weeaboo. These guys just want to copy frank so they just spam weeaboo wherever they can.....
wait, anime isn't chinese?
Rosetta Stone
My mom has an attic? I've been living in the basement so long I forgot the house

Papa Franku, is there such thing as a Feeaboo (a filthy frank weeaboo)
I love this guy xD !
frank is literally a god
80% of the commenters on this video are fag weeaboos. heavy breathing intensifies
GOD DAMMIT FRANK WE SAID DON'T TALK ABOUT SNK...
¬†Me and the rest of the weeaboos are going to have to come with a stronger 2nd turn, get ready bitch and finish your battle phase.... CUS YOU'RE ABOUT TO ACTIVATE MY TRAP CARD!
So......many........ Anime  wheeze........profile..... Pics dies
i have an anime avatar and i loved this vid... does that make me a weeaboo????
you can learn japanese from anime i watched all the seasons of icarly so i speak japanese fluently take that
THAT THOMAS THE TANKENGINE PART, I CRIED WHILE LAUGHING :D
All the dislikes on the video r weeaboos
like your videos keep it up
Well, I'm glad I'm not a weeaboo then. :) I was worried this video would just randomly insult everyone even remotely interested in anything Japanese.
Talk about Bronies
3/4 of people commenting have anime profile pictures
after watching this video , finally know my friends is a weeaboos
Wats wrong with beeing a weaboo i dont know wat it is but i think its like beeing racist
Even though the voice is fake, I keep thinking before each video Frank smokes an entire box of cigarettes to keep his trademark voice XD
I have a question I watch anime and bought a poster and like two pieces or merch for anime however that's all I'll do. I don't want to go to Japan or learn fucking Japanese its just a waste of peoples time to learn that shit unless for business or extra curricular. I know I'm German and a Chicagoan I still do things from my culture. Am I a stupid fuckin weeaboo? 

Oh and I have a bunch of other merch in my room but its for video games like Tf2 half life wolfenstein ect
Dude that penguin fucked up when he tried to take over your house huh. :D
4:10 that is actually quite accurate to what ive seen
Make up your fucking mind bruh
I watch chinese manga and read anime xD
O_O I like this i need more of this fuckt up shit.
People should understand the difference between a weeaboo and an otaku. A weeabo is someone who loves anime and acts japanese and stuff. I am an otaku (an otaku is some one who is obssesed with a certain thing and in this case, it is anime) and I don't do the stuff weeaboos do. I know some Japanese words (around 5 words) from the animes I watch and I only watched liek 19 animes (I count) ¬†I admit, I want to go to Japan with my friends because there is a Attack on Titan park in the Universial in Japan. And I don't get why people cosplay as anime characters (although I am an otaku) because never in forever will that person who is cosplaying look like the anime character they are cosplaying as. I have an attack on titan poster, keychain but those I got as gifts from my friends. And I also draw anime for fun. And tbh there isn't a problem for people to have their pfp as an anime character. And nor do I call myself Japanese. I am half Amrican and half Chinese and I will not abandon my culture and act Japanese. But please just understand the difference between being an otaku and a weeaboo becasue otakus are way better.
When I was younger, when talking about Asian people, we would say Chinese, like,
He's Chinese from Japan. I still do that just to provoke.

And Sailor moon was the worst Chinese cartoon of my childhood.
No way that he's 52 years old.
This guy's voice...
i would like to hear you speak normally for once :/
ANYONE NOTICE THAT MOSTLY ALL WEEABOOS ARE BIRDSHIT SKINNED CRACKERS?

LOL
what are the wanna b k pop//k drama looser called, they're like weeaboos, foreign from South Korea, learned all Korean from k drama k pop. dress like wonder girls and are basically just annoying. there was this girl i used to work at and damn she was just super annoying, pretending to know Korean, singing k pop and dancing, ¬†but when actually face to face with a real Korean ( not k pop) she can't utter more than hi hello, you know the basic shit. and when my girlfriend was around( who's Korean) she would barely speak Korean cos ¬†deep down she knows she is a phony a phony I say!!
Anime is for fegets

Remember Realm 900....
I hate anime
Is it sad that I have a Vietnamese friend who did try to act like a "cowboy," not to be disrespectful, I am part Korean‚úä, but I thought that was the funniest shit ever especially when he bought some "City Chili"
Bronies are angelic compared to weeaboos.

Your voice sounds like a broken record...............my ears are bleeding.
first things first chris chan is NOT a weaboo, hes a sonic fan.
weeaboo jones is my spirit animal
Isn't it wonderful how 98% of the fanbase judges people by what avatar they have?
Dude...these's something wrong with you...
A pigeon just landed outside my-----

OUTSIDE YOUR WHAT
Throughout the entire course of this video, I was stuck between laughing and internally dying due to the fact that it's so fucking true.
Can someone who understands japanese please tell me what he said at 4:10?
All I can say is, wow, your Japanese is so good. Accent and everything.
What the hell did I just watch? I've been to the dark side of the internet before, but clearly it needs a WTF section.. Having said that, LOVED THE VIDEO, IM subscribing.
my sister and her friend are both massive weaboos, they even say "cosplay isn't a weaboo thing" and go to conventions, and think they're actually good at cosplay (though lost a bet is even better than them)
kill me, end my suffering please
I can watch this video over and over. Laugh my ass off every time xD
WHO HONESTLY CARES!
Their life hurting you in some way? NO? Then leave them alone!
people gettin so offended because they have anime characters as there YouTube profile pic
So if I collect s few anime based things and find myself sort of obsessed with some animes and if I realized that I do act sort of Weeaboo and I don't want to be this way but I am. Does this mean I'm Weeaboo Trash, or just some lower version of Weeaboo, and I do make fun of Weeaboos. I am also Asian, but this does not change anything, just because I am Asian it doesn't take me out of the equation of not being a Weeaboo.
Bend over Franku and Hairy Harold the Hard Helicopter will give you an oil-change.
Oh fuck me, never drinking while watching a Filthy Frank video again.
Frank is 52?
I fucking love you dude.
Being that I spent 8 years of my childhood in Japan, these fucking weebs here are the bane of my existence.
For example, I decided to take a japanese class for an easy language credit, and to touch up on the language since I am going later in the year.
And so of course I expected maybe one or two otaku kids, but literally everyone in that fucking class with the exception of maybe 2 students are full on fucking weaboos. 
For the most part they all act like how you were saying, thinking they are fucking experts on everything japanese because they know how to write their name in katakana and know the whole theme song of sword art online in japanese by heart or some shit.
Its fucking embarassing. Half of these weebs are fucking autistic fedora wearing fuckers with neckbeards and shit, with no concept whatsoever of basic social skills.
It just begs the question "why?" 
Why the fuck did ALL the socially awkward kids with aspergers syndrome in the US have to get a hard on to japanese cartoons? Henceforth creating terrible fandoms and then creating the god forsaken weaboo who thinks they know everything japanese, but in reality don't know the first fucking thing about the place.
Where I grew up in Japan is in my opinion, one of the most beautiful and greatest places on earth, and will forever be a part of my childhood. It just pisses me off to no end when these otaku kids think that their fucking pedophilic cartoon squid porn is actually a siginificant part of japanese culture.
"Masturbating to 13 year old girls doesn't make¬†you Japanese, it just makes you a border line pedophile" ~ Frank 2014

4:19 what's the difference?
my favourite anime is kim possible Kappa
Found this guy out through a friend, mate, i laugh soo hard every time i watch these videos.
His weird fascination for puking is weird... and funny though
I hope anyone commenting on Frank's videos attempting to prove him wrong is just enabling him
So many anime avatars on this video! hahah its hilarious!
hey, my sword is based on a game! lol ..... sure its a Japanese anime style game..... and I do like anime..... but.... oh god!... ive been infected with weeaboo syndrome! :D
52 year olds don't wear skinny jeans. Or do they.evolution

You know what's even more fucked up than weeaboos? I saw this video of two hoodrats beating the shit out of each otger, and the girl who taped it was talking like she was black, but sounded ASIAN.

What would that be?
Animes i only watched pokemon but its a bit childish :S

I'm like...borderline. I'm in the middle, I'm not awful like Weeaboo's, but I love Japanese culture, because it's beautiful. That and America doesn't really have a culture.

i understood your first few lines. Am i a weeaboo ?
Most weaboos are just dumb teenagers who think that Japan is all about anime, manga, and video games. They're the shame of the anime community. You people are the reason why anime is becoming shit, because creators are trying to relate to you weabooo pieces of trash.
I believe that People who want to go to Japan because of anime and manga are complete and utter imbeciles. It's Japan's culture and cool sights and attractions is why I would like to go their but not until I properly learn the language so that not only can I respectfully put myself among them and learn more about the culture but so i wont look like a completely lost idiot while asking for directions to a cafe or some shit.

the rules I put about Japan applies to any other country too. I'm also very intrigued by Mexican culture and I can actually thank the Book of Life for that.
omfg.
Become the president, here.
Fucking best shit.
The filthy frank series needs to keep up... The manga is waaaay ahead of your videos.
Yo, i feels you, Budgie The Helicopter was my kind of Hentai!

I though WEEABOO Jones almost had you for minute there. Good to see you are safe.
Lo! Alas! The Weeaboos! They frock! To!And fro! Soon we will have to flee from this infected place! Follow me friends and I may help! A Cure is being made at Bramblestar Laboratory's! We might stay safe! I will send the guards to protect us from the angered Weebs! We have more forces with us! Snipars! SWA! (Lo a brutal force though) Many Illimuinatiis gather in formation to help the cause of Weebs.
I fuckign lost my shit when he played crossing road or field or whatever the fuck on his recorder im dead
Too bad Japan is a retarded country.
4:08 you make me laugh so much man
Weeaboos are truly revolting and I would rather take a constipated shit my dick then be one of....them
624 Fat Weeaboos dislike this video
My favorite anime is the Simpsons.
I would love to see/hear the perspective of someone else in the building while this was going on. I mean honestly someone has to be walking by and hear all this and become really confused. Unless it's his neighbors, in which case they've heard it all before.
anime is shit lol
Best anime is Aqua Teen Hunger Force
I can't believe your room mates put up with this
This video is pretty much like me and one of my friends!!!
#¬†Otaku 4 Rife
Yeah fuck them weaboos and their no good Chinese cartoons!
boku no cori the manga is better
subscribed..this is great
That carpet is so fucking Japanese though. And the door.
I demand an explanation as to what the fuck I have just been subjected to.
My favorite anime consist of Toy Story, Cory in the House, Air Plane Instructional documentaries from the 80's, and Seinfeld.
best bit was at 6:56
"Oh man I'm no weeaboo!"
Has a weeaboo username and anime display picture
My favorite anime is Looney toons cartoons from the fifties
Tom and jerry is my second favorite anime
I'm an Otaku and love Japan and it's culture, does that make me a weeaboo?
I mean, you don't see me going around the place and trying to speak and act Japanese, so I guess I'm not a weeaboo.

Also, my favourite anime is Lazy Town.
BRONIES ARE HORSE WEEABOOS TOO WE NEED TO KILL DISGUSTING CREATURES
4:10 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA XD
1st bitches
Fucking Weeboos
My favorite picture towards the end is sasuke getting arrested. Sasukes from Seinfeld right?
I love this. I love you. I'm subscribing. Right now.
Please do a vid like this but on brony's
This is the best thing I've ever seen.
Make fun of Anime. It will b awesome dudeeeeeee
I notice the fat ones get the privilege to go to Japan, while the people you like don't get to go.
and when these weaboos mess with kpop fans and koreaboos,WW3 starts and some koreaboos can give the weaboos a war that never ends
Omg I laughed for 10 minutes it was so funny!
I collect weapons because I'm a fan of martial arts, not anime. There's nothing wrong with it, unless you use it to look like something you're not on the internet. Weapons are cool and very interesting.
I mean, i collect swords from all cultures. I just like hanging them up and shit.
what up with youre voice
If you watch anime you're a nerd
Finally, A song for me.
YOU'RE FIFIY TWO?!
The Internet: created to help us, now is our enemy. Weeaboo is a disease, and I'm glad it's been addressed.
I'm really offended by this, but I just can't put my finger on why...
He described me when I was 12
He forgot king of the hill that's my favorite anime
lol
"W-W-WHERE ARE THE SUBTITLES."
Chris Chan LOL
We all know one, or 4..
I LOVE ARTHUR ON PBS
cory in the house isnt even an anime, noob
fk u anime is awesome u are just jealous that we are expressing ourselves, dipshit
I like how weeaboos complain about english dubs and subtitles. Meanwhile on dark souls: "You defeated". Seriously, some of the translations for dark souls 2 are so bad that they're making a patch that fixes item descriptions and lore.
oh my ///w/// <3
I like anime but I get annoyed  when people say anime is not a cartoon. :p um I think they are and I think it shouldn't matter if they are or not? Idk
#KillLaKillTheseFaggots
never watch frank-sama while there is people in the house they are going to think you are watching japonese gay porn
Ah. XD

I'm not a weaboo, and I don't have an unhealthy obsession with Japan and all anime in general, nor do I consider myself to be an expert or bother to learn japanese and embarrass myself by acting like anime is all there is to Japan and because of that I should be entitled to call myself japanese. Those kinds of people are extremely awkward on an unholy level unbeknownst to me.

But I do admit that I can get rather violent and overboard when it comes to a series I love. //heavy breathing

^^;
I actually agree with this guy. To like Anime is good, to explore different cultures is fine, but when you get to the point where it's all you can talk about, not that anyone's to blame for that, then you should slightly calm down!
It's really annoying when i have to deal with people saying¬†
"ONII-CHAN" "SO KAWAAII DESUU SEGOE"
and has the complete set of toys, sex toys, swords and clothes of every anime ever.
I got friends like that.
MAGNUM OPUS
You don't watch anime because you don't get them,you don't have enough intellect.Calling anime fans weaboos makes you look dumb.Just calm down and get over it.
Haven't watched this guy before... but.. Is he always that loud?
XD I LOVE THIS SHOW  but now I feel bad for using an anime avatar
i can't stop laughing.
DON'T TALK SHIT ABOUT ATTACK ON MAGATSU
ayyy god I love these kind of videos
same with superwholock 
fuck man they are like the stage you have after being a weeb 
and I watched all 10 seasons of spn so
lmao I hate 'otakus' and superwholockians though
and I am one. hahaha fuk u
tumblr ppl still the best :^)
you should be a voice for a ghoul in fallout
Bocu no pico is the best anime I ever seen
What was Weeaboo Jones' theme?
Fucking love Hentai!
Frank speaking japanese is so sexy.
YOU FUCKING CUNT. HOW DARE YOU TARGET A SINGLE CULTURE. YOU SPEAK ABOUT DIVERSITY WITH OTHER CULTURES, BUT POINT OUT US ANIME LOVERS AND JAPAN CULTURE SEEKERS BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE YOUR RACE!? HOW ABOUT I DIVERSIFY MY DICK IN YOUR ASSHOLE.¬†
I'LL TURN THAT SHIT FROM A MUDDY BROWN TO A WINE RED IN 0.34543E SECONDS YOU BITCH.
LOLTHE PICTURES DURING THE WEABOO SONG GAVE ME ULCERS
oh yeah and for all the retards  #sarcasm
and its actually 7
hey hey hey there are 2 kinds of weeaboos, the fatasses that you described and the relatively normal people like myself oh wait there the same thing most of the time...
You know... It's not too late to become Thomas the tank engine
Franku ur perdy shit and u think ur cuul but irl u just jelly cuz u dun get heli ass and you think u can it but you no it can if there was competition then is of camera but no it can see person because I write on and make good content liekdd subescorbided and will wash.
Japan is is pretty xenophobic, ahh the irony
frank i love you i have that same shirt <3
I hate Anime.
OH SHIT HERE THEY COME
The end really made me sad. That poor black man. It's all far too sad for me.
my fav anime is the tonight show with jimmy fallon
"Airplane instruction videos from the 80's" Goddammit, my ribs XD
You're hilarious man!
Cracked a wide smile seeing this. :)
Oh my God, I am laughing so hard! XD WTF is this shit? Subscribed!
No one seems to know that anime is literally just the Japanese word for cartoon... Its not a genre.
Fucking weeb scum.
Watch from 1:44 to 2:16 at 2x speed it fucking hilarious. XD

Also 2:46 to 2:56 is also fucking hilarious. XD
Thank you Franku my cauncer is cured
Damnit
Anyone who watches anime and is trying to defend it in any way should know that they have no power here.
I fucking love when he starts laughing, or someone starts laughing in the background at something they said/did
I did find a weeaboo in my mom's attic.

Explains where my dad has been for the past 5 years
The only thing worse then weeaboos is the homestuck fandom. I mean... fuck off guys.
My weeb friend talked me into going to some anime convention in Detroit, and what do you think I saw when I fucking got there? People dressed as animu or mango characters? Nope... a bunch of fucking homestuck fagbois and furries. Like, what the hell? They literally invade shit that has nothing to do with them and inject their awfulness into it. All of them were roleplaying which makes it at least 300% worse. Scum scummin' up my scum convention. The hilarious part was my friend was on a panel for the worst weeb fandom of them all... hetalia. I would complain about hetalia fans too, but that would require another block of text. Kthxbai
VENUS ANGELIC IS THE WORST FUCKING WEEABOO I KNOW LIKE PLEASE U ARE SWEDISH PLEASE JUST BE SWEDISH GO LOOK AT HER CHANNEL
I love anime and manga and video games and vocaloid and call myself otaku. But im not fucking annoying and think im Japanese because i know basiac Japanese vocab and watch and read a=anime and manga. Those arent otaku those are fucking assholes who ruin the good name of otaku. Anyway great video Frank

THANK YOU.

My God these fuckers are annoying. I enjoy the culture, I plan on studying it because I find it interesting and I'm a cultural person, but I can't be Japanese because it is not in my blood.

I love anime, I love manga, but I enjoy DC,MARVEL, IMAGE and western entertainment as well.

I draw in the manga style, and yeah..I'll use avatars too, But I don't collect weapons..I need money for you know, living.

I don't bash others because people are entitled to their own opinion and..well, yeah.

Weeaboos and otakus, Just..fuck, no.
is he speaking actual Japanese during the first 20 seconds or not? :S
everyone born from about 1975-2005 is a fucking weeb. we all grew up watching japanese cartoons on tv before we knew they were japanese cartoons. our parents put us in japanese martial arts schools to learn honor and disciple or whatever. if you played video games before 2005, almost all the great games were japanese. transformers, a major hollywood blockbuster series, is japanese. the fast and furious franchise started with characters racing pink and green japanese cars. they keep making japanese anime into hollywood movies like edge of tomorrow and ghost in the shell. and that says nothing of eating tasteless pocky, cooking awful "stir fry," or your little peepees and¬†nipples getting hard from watching your moe tentacle hentai library.

who blew the lid open on the nsa's spying complex? a tekken playing, cosplaying, pokemon collector, in his 30s.

some people are completely batshit obnoxious and delusional, but for at least 30 years if not longer, that weird ass country affected all of our hobbies in one way or another. of course japan has awesome culture and history... like italy russia china france britain ireland australia mexico brazil thailand egypt saudiarabia etcetcetc and murica.. but are there a pair of nuts that everyone aged 10-40 has swung on harder than japan's? thankfully japan's cultural influence is leveling off, so our children (if you find somebody dumb enough to make babies with you) can hope to live without a mental illness.

i guess if you're a part of the weeb generation, what really counts is how much you act like a slovenly mongoloid, because it's almost impossible to say that you aren't one (without being completely full of shit)
video of the year. BRAVO MAN BRAVO, made my anime flamboyent fanboy sister get all anal it was funny
more annoying than a weeaboo is a white knight feminist weeaboo...
Looked into Japanese mythology once, thought I was high at the time. God's pulling other Gods out of their butt holes.
But attack on titan is a good show.......weeaboos are fucked up though
Boko Haram is a good anime
My mofuking nigga don't you ever talk shit about black people or you gonna get yo ass kiked
Throat cancer

My favorite anime includes old episodes of its always sunny in Philadelphia, the Simpsons, and the old Godzilla movies. You know, Danny davito is my favorite anime character like ever
Frank feigning his knowlegde about anime... its obvious you know more than ur letting out you EX-WEEABO!
Lol im a japanophile then lol.
you think the japanese are xenophobic frank? look at fuckin north korea.

Look at those¬†weaboos with their anime profile picture, what are thinking those fags when they are using that shit ... I am a fag so i am allowed to use it.
"I've had so much sex with my body pillow it stands up on its own", I had to pause for a minute there till I stopped laughing...

how come the pink guy album is free but not the weeaboo song?! come on man
Scooby-Doo is the best animu of all time. All of you saying it's Cory, you're all just a bunch of baka gaijins. Cory is a mango, not an animu. Kids these days, ugh, I was born in the wrong generation.
I'd love to see Frank make fun of bronies but NOT because its mostly males liking ponies because thats not the problem, the problem is how they took a fandom that was actually pretty fun and turned it into something really AWFUL. I mean damn, they can be creeps! And I would love to see thier tears in the comment section.
I'd never cound cosplayers as weaboos because they get harrassed by them too. If you go to an anime convention in a cosplay, you GOTTA watch out for them, they are annoying as HELL.
I have never seen a single anime that I could sit through an entire episode of. The closest I got was fullmetal alchemist. For me at least, its the god damn way they talk that ruins it for me. The shitty, unrealistic halting speech just makes me cringe and turn off the TV.

HELLO WAITER, I WOULD LIKE A FLAME WAR ABOUT ME THIS INSTANT.
I ALSO DESIRE A SIDE ORDER OF REPLIES LIKE "WEEABOO TRASH" "GO OFF YOURSELF" ETC. EXTRA EDGY, SALTY AND LOTS OF HATE!111!
I'm 25% Japanese and have a katana but that because I collect swords and knives but I have like 5 AoT manga books and plane on living in Japan does that make me a weeaboo?
I am a weeaboo for Berserk manga, I collect that chit religiously. Fuck the rest. Western animation is superior, and that's a fucking fact.

Anime is just cheap ass chit, recycled and lazily done. The entire background just one still image, including any people in it. This never changes, and they never attempt to make it any better.
My favorite Chinese cartoon is Ni hao Kai lan.
hey dude loved the video it was so funny but please refrain from using the F-slur!
Please more Ainsley Harriott videos
I cannot stop laughing xD SUBBED!
Filthy Frank you are the best! I would like to show this video for those assfucks who quite literally fuck their pillows and think they are japanese!! And yes the Japs are the most racist community nowadays. Love the irony!! :D Btw fuckers watch the video. Just because you love an anime or prefer subs you are not a weeabo. But when you say jap is teh best and kawaii as fuck and you wear kimono for show how much you wish to suck a japanese dick and you are buying figures so you can jerk of while watching them.. Wow.. Fucking sick bastards. I would rather fuck quasimodo than fuck my pillow.. There is no cure for being a cunt. I met with the most adorable and cutest girl because I've been watching this sick ass show the right time to get drunk as fuck while watching it and register to a dating site to find someone to fuck. But than I met with the most adorable girl ever. Long story (really fucking long) short thank you motherfucking Filthy Frank! You are my hero and I would grow a pussy for you!!!¬†
And you weeabos and stupidass fucking idiots who don't even know what it means and accuse everyone of being a weeabo just because they watch anime. Hope you guys are going to have your dick driven through a bulldozer. Fucking losers.
AND STOP FUCKING YOUR PILLOWS YOU FUCKING DISGUSTING MOTHERFUCKERS!
Howdy, my name is Kenichi Smith.

I‚Äôm a 27 year old Japanese Toonaholic (Cartoon fan for you foreigners). I draw cartoons and comics on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior American games. (Halo, Gears of War, Call of Duty)

I train with my 1911 every day, this superior weapon can shoot straight through steel because it kicks ass, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my gun license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.

I speak English fluently, both the Midwestern and the East Coast accents, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their Constitution, which I follow 100%

When I get my American visa, I am moving to New York to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Nickelodeon or a game designer!

I own several cowboy outfits, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I keep cool to my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.

Wish me luck in America!
It's fine if you're a black weeaboo, though. In that case, you're just amazing: a spectacle to behold.
My favorite onime is attack on sword art nwruta and I dontclike how you talk about us because I can really do Japanese and know so many anime's that I'm actually Japanese because Im going to Japan to find my waifu so I can do dirty thing with her like sex although I don't know how you do that. And also you said that we stink but that's not true because true samurais like me don't need to shower because I smell like real samurai spirit
Why making fun of Naruto, i think that naruto is to good and to mainstream for weeaboos.
BLUUUARGGGHHHHH threw up because of the weeaboos
I've got a weeaboo stalker... Franku.. please help me.. She got into my facebook... JUST TO ADD HERSELF!!
in the countrys that people skeak spanish, they are called Otacos.
lol weaboos arent that bad ,we saw a culture that we ¬†like through anime and we wanna go to japan to see what it's like for real. yeah we cosplay and buy some figures and swords but we're no diffrent from the trekies and the star wars fans. There is a limit tho you can be a weaboo, but dont be that guy who's suddenly wearing a kimino with a top knot and eating with chopsticks
I love anime and I love Japanese culture. But I am a proud Mexican american. Anyone who tries to adapt to a different culture is insecure and has very low self esteem. They don't know what they want and try to be someone else. Also I think its people who are not satisfied with their lives.
581 dislike all weeaboos -_-
PREJUDICE EQUALITY. EVERYONE GETS SHIT
I'm a weeaboo and I love anime. It made me kill my own family
Song name with the piano?
I watch Anime Dubbed therefore MURICAAAAAAA jk

FUCK BRONIES start rage chain
He is So Weird But Funny
....but is it okay if im into weapons from the medieval (i have no idea how to spell that shiz) weapons, such as halberds claymores sabres and such, i just like swords and stuff like that.
"Dont talk sh*t about Attack on Tooting its a really good show"
I'm scared, and alone.¬†
This video.
Surrounds my anus.
My favorite anime is teletubbies
I don't hate weeaboos but I do find them sad. If only they knew.
The pathetic, fat, pillow-fucking, waste of life, parody depiction of anime fans in North America is the normal depiction of geeks/otaku in Japan.
Senpai did notice you . . .






. . . and he fucking hates you.
Had so many moron friends with this Weeaboo shit XD. I may watch anime/read manga but that because I found them entertaining(Seinen manga is the best). In general, I like anything with a great story that always give me a good plot twist. Jap manga, does give you a lot of weird shit with interesting story.
fukkin weeaboos m8 makes me sick i swear on me mum
the best anime is spongebob m8
Weeaboos...Weeaboos everywhere
"I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass, y'know?" - Filthy Frank 2014
hilarious video ^^
but....there's one thing i don't really understand.
i keep seeing jokes about weaboos doing or wearing something related to Naruto ...but if im correct, doesn't anime die-hards despite naruto? seems odd to me
1% of furious-breathing weeaboo dislikes
my wife is coming to life
Should i feel bad now ? :((
I live in Japan and can confirm that school girls here do have eyes bigger then their face.
Let's admit it the Weeabo Protection Chamber was useless.

All my life i always thought anime loving looser virgens looked the same üòÇüòÇ fat (or disgustingly skinny) , little nasty glasses , acne , BIG WORDS IN ther sentences , always stuck on ther laptop or ds , they always take pictures in thyre room using the light from a device , antisocial , and they have that nasty and disgusting laugh  one more thing they always defend themselves with facts
0:45 *their
next time you see someone with a anime avi say sword art online is the best anime kappa
How the hell do you keep from laughing a shitload when making your vids lol
I want to laugh, but there's a big fat animu advertisement filling up the fucking screen.

My reaction to weeaboos at school: Mainstream weeaboo trash, gtfo from me.
You know, there is a special drink for people such as Weeaboos, furries, bronzes, emos, etc. It's called bleach. If you fall under any of these groups or Fandoms, I definitely suggest you drink some immediately.
Chinese cartoons and Korean comic books.
So what you saying about anime?
One of the few people who uses the word faggot with impunity lol
>Likes anime
>Is not a weeaboo
Choose one (1)
5:11 i would laugh so fucking hard if i ever hear an Asian person saying this right next to me...

My friend translated for me and when he's supposedly saying

"Are you ready to have some fun"

the actual translation is¬†

"There are two rapists in my closet right now, both of them are dead"
This brought tears to my eyes
I'm new to the channel and I saw this. After I watched it o subbed cuz he's funny
I changed my avatar just because of this video
I'm pretty sure Safari Man says "I like penis" when Frank subtitled it with "We have to run"... Or something among those lines? I don't really know, I know like... A few phrases in Japanese. That's it.
I'm new to Filthy Frank, is that his real voice?
Anyone know what song starts at 6:42 ?
That graphic tablet. 3:46

9:26 wtf am i reading??
Wait... I can't collect swords anymore?

my favorite anime is adventure time
Weaboos still better than bronies lol.

Holy shit you're over 50?
lets face it guys, 100% of the "otakus" and weeaboos are ¬†fat virgins that live in their moms basement and jerk of to fucking cartoons!
my favorite animes would probably be doctor who, brazzers, my little pony, and the one with the tentacles
My favorite anime its Ben 10
I wish he'd address bronies too
i love it when you laugh in your videos Franku

4. Two and A Half men¬†
5. The Big Bang Theory¬†
They Are the best anime I've ever seen .
Sorry but anime is the only thing that got me through high school last year. I had an hour long talk on Skype with a homosexual 14 year old about suicide. I like it etc and will probably grow to become a Weeaboo but fuck if i care. It probably kept me alive so i think i'll stick with it.
King of the Hill is the best anime evarr

anime is gay and fucking weird anyway
i really want to know the song when Weeaboo Jones enters the realm XD anyone know it?
I told a weeaboo my favorite anime was Corey in the House and she said "that's not anime.."
That rare albino Snorlax is definitely bae @9:45
XD this is funny as hell!
When it is subtitled "are you ready to have some fun?", in japanese he actually says "There are two Jewish people (locked) in my closet".

Then when it is subtitled "I sure am!" he says "both of them are dead."
LMAO @ all the comments
9:56 was that peanut butter gamer?
I can't breath XD
gawd you ugly guy shouldnt squeeze your fac einto the camera. But I have never considered myself as japanese. I just like the animes, I like the culture but I dont consider myself as japanese. And there is a way to get rid of acne, its called healthy food and washing.
Coulnd't agree more. The other day I saw video of a "Cold Steel Katana" being demonstrated by its own manufacturers, which were average american guys. The results were really amazing, the katana was able to effortlessly cut through many tough materials and obviously the guys wielding it weren't total professionals (or samurais for that matter).

¬†Then this weeaboo fuck in the comments spewed the most autistic and retarded shit I've ever heard come out of the mouth of these fucking waste of human resource known as weeaboos.
I quote, " All this fat fuckers swinging around katanas ¬† without honor for the sword, and using it like a Baseball bat hitting right hand strikes....You should all go kill yourself". I thought to myself, well he must be a pretty skilled japanese guy with training in this matter to say this kind of things.

¬†Sure enough, after being shat on by many other commenters who acknowledged how much of an autistic failure he was, he said " I am american too". This was followed by someone asking if he had ever wielded a katana, and surprise, surpsrise! The response was "no"

TL;DR : Holy shit I hate these fags.
On 9:55 both asian girls look like chimpanzees with a fuck load of makeup.
MY NAME IS COWBOY TARAKA
GOD DAMNUT HE CAUGHT ME
my throat hurts when i hear you talk in english
YOU ARE MY NEW FAVORITE YOUTUBER.
I do believe the guy at 9:48 is Thaddeus Lewis McMichael, who was arrested for possession of child pornography. The arrest report is public record, and is absolutely hilarious.
Filthy frank thank you for this incredible message I will respect your message about wee boo  all I need to say is thank you keep up the great work boss
Can somebody explain the origin of the word "weeaboo"?
There are a lot of them 4chan...
moar cory in da hous m8
How do you move between Realms?
Cory in the house is the best anime ever made
4:10 PLS
Seinfeld is also¬†my favorite anime
I have watched this so many times
But AoT is a good show...
Niggas over here saying waifu, senpai, ching chong.
Motherfuckers watching that animation mango shit, like goddamn nigga, this ain't japan, get the fuck out with that weeaboo shit.
As far as I'm concerned, people who "just like anime" and weeaboos are the same thing.
How to Piss off a Weeaboo THE MOST: Claim that anime is a cartoon
Damn this shit was a ride

Attack on titian is a really good show thou I'm not a Weeaboo xD I don't try and learn Japanese I don't  really watch anime I don't collect crappy ninja swords and stuff liek dat so therefor.. I am not a Weeaboo :3
my favorite anime is king of the hill
o-o.. *disturbed on many levels* How entertaining to watch a..weird.. thing rant for 11 minutes..
I thought this is very funny, and I think it's true. Honestly I really love anime and manga, and I love finding people who like the same things. But I do agree. I think it's okay to have hobbies from cultures that are different from yours, but it's still positive to stay in touch with your own culture and realize that Japan is not like anime and thinks in Japan don't turn out like anime as well. I think it's fine having a hobby and it's okay to collect these things on the hobby you have, but it's good to remember that the real world may not be like the cartoons we watch, and that we still have our own cultures.
There I was, about to hang myself. My blood from all the cutting myself for attention was dripping. Right when I was about to end it, I heard a voice call out. That voice had saved me even to this very day. I still remember what it was; "Ey b0ss". Also plz make fun of furries. Having sex with dogs is not okay.
YOU THINK ITS FUNNY THAT WE BREATH HEAVY AND TYPE ON KEYBOARDS?!
WELL GUESS WHAT! I HAVE A FUCKING HAMBURGER TRAPPED IN MY THROAT. FUCKING FITE ME BRO. THIS MADE ME BREATH EXTRA HEAVY JUST PRESSING THE CAP BUTTON. 

Baus.
Make one about bronies
chris-chan :D
Goddamn weeaboos trying to be Chinese.
Yea, who ever uses a anime character as their icon pic is a complete faggot.
Youre half japanese right
I'm waiting for you to make one on Bronies!
Seinfeld is the best anime.
This was fucking hilarious. After the middle of the video I started to wonder what the fuck I was watching though.

I also like some anime and manga series and love a lot about Japanese culture but some people just make asses of themselves by taking it too far.

But anyways, this rant was funny and entertaining.
Make fun of the Jews and blacks. Come on, do it, you filthy nigger cock!

But please don't say anything negative about Japanese people, that's just offensive.
Make cowboy Tanaka a thing!
this was golden
"Hello, my name is Cowboy Tanaka." xD 10/10

Bronies and Furries plz
That's some really impressive recorder playing.
My favorite anime is the middle.
I found this video randomly. Yep...I'm on the weird side of YouTube again.
I love all the super morbid stuff he says in Japanese, then subtitles it as a totally innocent message in English.
The only anime I watched and didn't feel ashamed or want to kill myself afterwards is Attack on Titan..But yea. Weebs are cancer
way 2 slay
So many weeaboos in my Japanese class... Please help
THIS IS THE INTERNET YOU CANT HAVE AN OPINION HERE YOU CAN ONLY HAVE SOMEONE ELSES OPINION HERE!
Stop watching that weeaboo crap and watch some real anime like king of the hill

You just materialized my very old thoughts about this topic. Thank you evermore for the video. Like.... genuinely, thank you.
This guys fucking great lmfao.
I rap and someone sent me a vid of him dissing underground rappers thats how I first saw him.
Even tho the dis was somewhat on me too since I rap, it was still funny as shit because it made me think of all the other "rappers" I see lmfao
I hate the people that make accounts with as there waifus and fuck around youtube pretending to be their waifu
Holy shut franku, the comments on this video are giving a fucking tumor.
10:04 looks like Frank isn't the only one who gets mad pussy...
Ey b0ss
Weeabos make me embarrassed to be a gaijin, they're and they stink. Surely if they wanted to be Japanese they'd wash, as hygiene is important here.
After that Attack on titan hype i realized how many weeaboos there are, and how many weeaboos it created
If you call your self a otaku you are a weeaboo
Is getting a katana/wakizashi just to learn the fighting style "weaboo"?
Omg you should work with adult swim bruhh
i could make a filthy frank manga
Seinfeld, best anime of 1997. So much better than attack on titan.
I've learned Japanese from TVFilthyFrank.
I'M ONLY 2 MINUTES IN AND I'M DYING I LOVE YOU FILTHYFRANK FUCK LOL
Papa Franku! I'm not japanese, but can i become a Samurai?
Or would that make me a Weeaboo?
haha im a weeaboo and proud to be one XD
Frank you're my favourite bedtime hero.
The song was beautiful.
hey.. frank has a clean shirt in this episode.
RIP Weeaboo Jones may your afterlife be as wet and dirty as your wife pillow
I only watch anime for the messed up stuff like people exploding or getting their heads bit off.
My favorite anime is Regular show Adventure time the walking dead and wwe.üòÉ
I want dat piece of Percy's ass
Best thing I've seen in a while.

"Rosetta Stone" Made me lose my shit!!!

Loved this vid Frank, keep 'em filthy <3
frank please start making vlogs
where r du subtitels
The subtitles you put at the beggining were all wrong, those were different words than what you said in japanese ,o,
This is to funny and true
I can never tell what is classified as an Otaku and what is a Weeaboo...This is all to confusing..brain overloading..INTERNET WHY!!
Weaaboos assemble
I'm not a weaboo guys.
I only watch anime, read manga, collect merchandise, masturbate to hentai, live in my moms house, shower once every 8 weeks, study Japanese online, save up to move to Japan, and ignore any girl that isn't Japanese. I'm not a weaboo, right? Right?
Why do white girls hang in threes? because, they can't even.
I just noticed a comment by a warcock that uh goes by the name Toxicz, saying how great Japanese culture is. I've never laughed harder in my life.
Hello. My name is cowboy Tanaka
9:00 I would not touch anything in those rooms at all...
oh god Chris-Chan 10:10
The worst part with weeaboos wanting to go to Japan thinking everyone likes anime is that anime is also looked down upon in Japan. That's the reason the word otaku was made it's Japan's counterpart to weeaboo. Though i still think it's fucking retarded that anyone who just watches anime is instantly classified as a weeaboo.
I agree with this to a point, but I don't think it's necessarily making you a weeaboo by small things like changing your profile pic to anime or similar. Also, someone could have a respect for Japan and their culture etc yet still watch anime, collect figurines and try to learn the language (as long as they do it properly). But yeah, I hate the annoying know it all obsessed ones too :l
best video i've seen in youtube so far
After watching this I realize I am a softcore Weeaboo
lmao cowboy tanaka XD
HOW DARE YOU INSULT INNOCENT PEOPLE LIKE THIS! you should be ashamed of yourself you unloved child!
as a weeaboo, i approve this. its so kawaii. my favorite animes also consist of cory in the house, seinnfeld, 80s airplane instructional vieos, and toystory. kawaii desu baka senpai chan ^.^
THE PIDGEONS!!
I'm not quite sure what I just watched...
what are you talking about? i don't know a single person with anime avatar on the entire internet...
Congratulations b0ss. You fucking did it. You stirred up some big shit.

hank of the hill is where its at

I laughed so hard at this because I remember when I was 13 I became a wee a boo for while but I'm now I'm 16 and glad I got out of that
I find it strange to be half Australian and half Japanese. Maybe that's why you're so retarded. Im jeleaous üò¢
hey bawss
Cowboy Tanaka needs to be a new character.
I love how the first clip is just him laughing for no reason.
And then when he's talking about Thomas the Tank Engine and he's laughing his ass off.
I actually really like collecting swords...
Poor Pigeon T_T
This really made me laughed out loud
(I'm just an ordinary boy who likes anime)
If i call a person a weeaboo and he says that he is an otaku, what does it mean?
I can't even do up my top button on my shirt WTF
LoL not me :P
am i the only one that couldnt stand his voice?
is filthy frank japenese im so confused lol
That song is catchy as fuck. WEABOO4LIFE
This describes half of the people at my highschool .___.
I hear the Steve Harvey show is a good anime.
In your moms attic.
Next door to my house there is this 35 year old greasy smelly guy who wears cat ears all the time. Sometimes late at night you can hear him yelling out names of female anime characters. Not in a sex way though, it's like he is really mad at them and he is telling them to get out of his house. It's really fucked up.
I raped 900000000 weaboos just to please Chin Chin bosS.
I have three cocks.
Say shit about bronies maybe
6:16
so tell me am i considered a weeaboo if I watch anime and that shit, want to go to 2015 anime expo, and am considering moving to japan because I like the culture there better than here?
Where have I been all my life? How did Filthy Frank went under my radar? How have I not discovered this guy earlier? Such a shame
Anime avatars are ok (unless those are with half-naked anime girls, those are shit), However i agreed with everything else that you said :)
But at least I don't call people Chan 

"KAWAII DESU BAKA SENPAI CHAN WON'T NOTICE MEEE!"
Lol I am such a weeaboo
No lie this is what I try to say to all my friends who want to get into anime. Don't be a weaboo.

Now when it comes to wanting to learn japanese. That's different. I wanna pull off that shit that you did at 4:10..... because it sounded cool as fuck. XD
I'm weeaboo trash ;3;
why the batman voice?
breathes heavily while angrily typing insults into the comments section Just kidding XD

I have a real Katana from world war two . . . And I like Pokemon. . .and Evangelion, Magi, Attack on Titan, Sora No Otoshimono. . . and Dead Man Wonderland, Cowboy Bebop, Madoka Magika. . . And YU-Gi-Oh. . . and Starblazers, FLCL, Higurashi, Digimon, Sailor Moon, Eureka Seven. I also read those weird Japaneeze comics.Did I mention that I pack my lunch into bento boxes, shaped like Naruto Kunai ? I think I have binders of my Pokemon cards in my closet, and dusty anime figures. . .I also cosplay, but only the "cool quiet badass" types. . . #cosplay   #anime   #japan ¬†
Does that make me a Weea-ja-boo-boo +TVFilthyFrank¬† ?

Song at 6:43?
Not gonna lie I got some throwing knives and a katana and a machete other various weapons. But only because I'm a super ninja dude. The 47th one in fact.
HOLY FUCK I DIED.
MmAhem


/Percy was a guy/
ƒ± think this video is just so rude , ƒ± watch anime every day , i want to learn japanese ( cause' we need to learn 3 languages-to get a job) and i want to learn japanese culture too , this does not make me 'weeaboo' . You can not judge people of their interests
The filthy frank fanbase
50% weeaboos
40% montage parody kids
10% normal people
I love Cory in the house.¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I'm dying here. The most relevant video on weeaboos.
I think weeaboos are almost as bad as bronies, its pathetic that these things actually exist.
those weeaboo pictures literally made me cringe
50 cal machine gun full of semen
Shit Frank, those fuckin nerds are coming to my house... Best call the nyeeessss navy seals... Maybe they will mow them down with a 50 cal machine gun...
When I laugh at this video i'm laughing at myself because i'm a filthy weeaboo.
4:00 Nearly killed me!
so sexy id rape dat
Weeaboos are even more annoying than Republicans
u talkin shit bout my neck beard?
Anime is for faggot ass virgins.
Chords to weeaboo song?
i love anime, but weeaboos make the anime fandom look bad ._:
Why is it called Anime to begin with? Why not just call it Japanese Cartoons?
FUCK WANNABE ASIANS
6:55
You wanna find weeaboos take Japanese in college. Like it's so sad I wanna lean Japanese not fucking talk your waifu body pillow and watch as you fetishize my damn professor
I rate 8 / 8 I feel more japanese by watching this video.
IM A WEEABO...
now that i have your attention lets fook em all up
This is one of my favorite things on the internet. Not just youtube, THE INTERNET. This is beyond art. This truly plunges into the depths of human experiences, explores what lies at the very subconscious of our species.

I love you Franku.
weeaboos should stop embarassing theirselves, showing those pictures of "Hardcore" addict made me want to smack those fats out
but making your avatar anime character doesn't do anything about it
frank all your subscribers are weeaboo faggots as you can see from this comment section
hentai on the down-low :3
OMG!!!! XD
this actually reminded me of someone I know (someone that I despise)

''Where are the subtitles?''

Goddammit man, my sides.
you Know i see how pathetic this video is frank but yeah i agree with the Pillows¬† and not being hygienic but seriously¬† they're not bothering you dude and also your bashing cosplayers that is not cool . And I'll be honest im anime fan myself and a cosplayer and maybe learn to speak Japanese but i never threw my culture away and who i am im just an otaku and also i care about Japan they been suffered ever since WW2 living in radiation .and also frank your not funny your just a troll like Anime is Satan
Ha I don't consider myself a weeboo or an otaku but I love watching anime on my free time. Anyways, I laugh throughout the whole video. You just got one another sub! Sorry for my avatar though.
HEY I RECOGNIZE THAT SCREAM. The higurashi nail ripping scene. God yes! <3
He's a bit wild but its cool lol

reminds me of rawhide kobayashi
6:30 wait a second...
Do you have a throat cancer or something?
Its funny, cause joji watches naruto and remember that time when there was the weeaboo car with anime all over it
Frank, you really good for a voice actor.
eto...
HEAVY BREATHING THAT'S NOT FUCKING TRUEEEEEEEE
FUCK YOU WHY YOU MAKE FUN OF ANIME?!
I'LL COME THERE AND FUCK YOU UP NEVER MAKE FUN OF ANIME EVER AGAIN
My thoughts exactly
Finally. Now I know God exists for He hath created this magnificent human being

hi.
Awesome video ^-^
Where's the Pocky/Mikado at tho?
i was expecting more hate from the pedos
XD this made me laugh so hard!
Did anyone learned Japanese from Japanese¬†commercial?
My twitter profile pic i sumia from fire emblem
I laugh at this so much but it makes me want to stop watching anime. :(
This is the most accurate thing i have ever seen. I mean i watch anime and buy anime merchandise but i deeply respect Japanese culture.
At 10:12 is there a hammer and sickle in the background? He's not just a weeaboo but he's a commie weeaboo.
From now on, i'm going to walk like weeaboo Jones.
Fucking Gold
Frank I love you, you're like a reflection of me.
Man, those horrible video effects...make the whole video even funnier!
what does that fat thing on the weaboo jones represent?
Wait is pink guy and the rest of the crew is just Filthy frank ._.
One of the only things I could say about the pictures he used in the song was "Those poor hooters girls...."
Only animes I ever watched were Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo, but those were fucking sick
Amazing.
I agree, I have a friend that's a total weeaboo
Yes! I hate all anime, exept naruto... Lmao. Fuck weraboos tho
You know now that I look at these weeaboos I realize I'm not one, hell I don't even have half as fucking much as those dedicated motherfuckers cause I don't buy that much stuff that are over priced. DAMMIT :C
neon genesis pls thnx
XD does my profile picture make you uncomfortable wiggles eyebrows
You know what's fucking sad? 52 year old men wearing grey skinny jeans. Culture is disintegrating. Feeding  insecurities to the economy. (I love you Frank, even though you sacrificed your existence/dignity with that purchase).
The funny thing is that most of the top comments agreeing with you are weeaboos thenselves. Iz gud delz m8
So basically the difference is being a competent person?
4:10 you serious?????????? My world is a lie.
please put i am beautiful on itunes!!!
When people actually think posting comments in franku's videos will get any serious replies to them ( Õ°o Õú ñ Õ°o)
Hi, I love anime.
Desu
i like mangas and anime and i just put anime profile pics cause most of them are badass¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I especially hate anime fans that try and ruin shows for new watchers by calling them "Overrated", trying to make themselves sound like they are better than everyone else because they actually watch "quality" anime's. Example: Attack on Titan. It was actually really great, but pretentious people try to denounce it to make them seem like they are really the experts and have some kind of fucking anime review channel. Ridiculous.
i still love this video
bronies are wors

Filthy Frank makes me sticky
is this his persona to talk like a crazy person who's about to have a heart attack?

OH MY GOSH I LOVE YOU!!!!
YOU ARE SO PERFECT!!!!
YOU ARE FUNNY!
You know, this is a great video.
my fav anime is Avatar: The Last Airbender. MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
I've seen clean, hygenic weaboos before.
What song is that that Frank always uses at 6:10. The ominous middle eastern music?
Cowboy takira
but what if you learn form rosetta stone because you just want to learn?
cory in the house is my fettish (¬¨Õ∫¬¨)
Guys stop hating on EVERYONE with an anime profile picture, as filthy frank said "Theres a difference between being a person who just likes anime, and people that are full-on, disgusting, un-hygenic weeaboos"
hahahaha japanophile, holy fuck
i love anime
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL... WEEABOOS, EMOS, SCENES.....Lol Kids are creative these days i see
My favorite anime is the Godfather Trilogy

Anime: Boku no Pico
Song: Darude - Sandstorm
505 WEEABOOS confirmed...
i am currently wondering where i would be able to see the anime in which the photo shown near the beginnning of the video is from
Its a shame that second generation Japanese are not considerate of the sacrifices of their parents and spend life whiling away on internet....Filthy frank's parents shud have caned him in his childhood...now he is beyond control...pity on his parents though...
I'm getting a new roommate next semester the previous two I had were borderline Weeaboos. I'm scared the next one will be full on weeb.
This is 100% accurate. Approved by Maka the Weeaboo.
lol a jewjap
lol ohh Weeaboos, giving the anime community a bad name.
Cancer reporting in.
After that picture with pewdiefag I stopped watching Franks videos but for some reason I watched this one¬†curiosity. Initially I disagreed with this video because I was one of the sub humans who had an anime profile picture and my friends list on facebook was full of the same people. When I actually looked at their profiles I realised Franku was right, weeaboos are disgusting. With that I stopped being a weeaboo, I still watch anime but other than that ever other trait is gone.
Lol I actually tricked my friend into watching this and got REALLY offended!!! XD
O.0
Cowboy Tanaka. I almost died.
yeah fuck chinese cartoons
All the people from the weird part of the Internet are here...

What is wrong with your voice?
So, to dress up as Weeaboo Jones did you have to just not shave downstairs for like half a year? Because it looks like your crotch is sticking out father than my nose is from my face, and I'm Jewish.

I bet it went over 99% of people's heads when he called Toy Story as anime. :)
Just a small mind blow for everyone out there, Toy Story is an anime and I love it that Frank is calling it out. But I bet most of you can't tell why it's an anime and try to argue "That's not anime cuz anime is loik..." don't you? :)
Hey bawssss!
holy shit. It's hector who fits the description.

So Crunchyroll has just been announced on the Wii U..
"Wiiaboo" now coming to a Wii U in your mothers basement.
The only thing good about anime is that it takes a person's sick fetish fantasies and visualizes it for you to jack off to your most wild fucked up pedosickocorpsefilia fetishes that one can only dream about.

Hentai is the fucking best. But I love me some good blonde lesbo DP action.

Please do bronies
Cory in the house is an anime classic
Funny shit, subbed!
I can safely say that anime is the worst fandom out there. In my humble opinion atleast, all the bronies, sonic fans, homestuck fans, furries and "gamers" can't hold a candle to how utterly repulsive anime fans are. I'm gonna stop here because if I start rambling about anime fans I'd end up writing 3 pages of pure bullshit.

This is the first video I've seen of him but why does he speak perfect Japanese but his English voice is so croaky. Sounds like he needs to clear his throat, does he always sound like that?
Ah man this video made my day.
We hunt them
holy shit the comment section here is still a giant circle jerking echochamber
frank ur good but how does it feel to have brown nosing sycophantic fans like this
You are so funny

Most of the comments have anime pictures :p
So you're telling me japanese girls in hentai's dont scream like that in real life? This video is a fucking sham

Well this is awkward
I'm so sad that this video had to end
if weeaboo = disrespect for culture + making a complete ass of self...
does that make frank a weeaboo?

frank is like both Hodge twins rolled into one person
What's the song at 6:46?
O_O Where have you been all my life?
cory in the house is da best anime ever
Why is everyone so angry? Like sometimes I watch a Japanese cartoon so what? I''m confused as shit, is he attacking people who just enjoy Japanese cartoons or specifically weaboo's? You know I'll be completely honest here I feel a little hurt when people just outright insult me, like what the fuck did I do? I don't have autism myself but I do have social anxiety and have a bit of an inferiority complex, it's no joke to just go around labeling people with a mental illness because they enjoy a specific medium of animation, that fucks with a person.
but.. but.. attack on titan is a decent anime and i have swords form the series bleach that I have some that are sharpened but some for decoration... im not a weeb, just a fan... but besides the fact, funny ass video.
I agree with with you 99.99%.But,come on,how cool would it be to have a fucking katana!!!
I'm breathing pretty heavy right now, so get ready.
dude u no That's So Raven is the best anime b0ss
uhh what the fuck is wrong with your voice kid
and how do you have 1 million views
Everyone is so offended on the comments this is amazing.
I swear to God I love you
That was kinda cruel bro.
The Japanese are a filthy race of commies and should have been nuked to death during World War 2! ....










Ok no, but srsly the Japanese don't get enough credit for war crimes during WW2, they were almost as bad as the Nazis.
Look at all these weeaboos in the comments, christ.
My childhood friend was a weeaboo almost our whole friendship. I didn't know there was a name for it, but he was unhealthily obsessed with anime and its characters and oh god, it's music.
Haaa haa rasengan
this comment section basically consists of flame wars
This is funny, I r8 8/8 no h8 m8
Watching hentai on the downloads.YEAH YOU KNOW I WATCH THAT SHIT BRA!!!
Weeaboo trash I totally agree.
this guy. is a god.
Bronys next?
That guy... Was holding hands... With the girl from bakugan. What a disappointment.
1,000,000 views later and the weeaboos are still smearing their shit all over the internet.
How does he even keep a straight face with these videos?
My favorite anime is everybody hates chris, but Seinfeld is a very close second.
Filthy Frank you are so stupied stop being a butthole and let people watch pokemon what do u like what if you had a favorite thing and somone made fun of it see stupied
lmao funny yet true! ¬†My friend is obsessed with anime and everytime he clocks an asian girl he flips out and tries to hit on them. pretty pathetic but w/e
Reality check!

God has created weeaboos to give us a sign that the world will end with weebs starting world war 3 and getting executed by katanas.

Those weeaboos are so fucking annoying. At my school, there are like 7 or 8 weeaboos who all sit with each other every day and do literally all of the weeaboo stereotypes in the book. They say they're Japanese when none of them look the slightest bit Japanese and sometimes even squint their eyes and spew a bunch of gibberish and pass it off as Japanese. Whenever I tell one of them that they're not really Japanese, they just say some crap like "Ella Con Tinga Mon Panda Mohima." and say something like "I just insulted you in Japanese. If you were smarter you'd know what I said." Or some random crap like that. They talk about nothing but Anime every second of their lives when they really don't know shit about anime. They're obvious noobs to anime because I hear them talking about shows like Attack on Titan, One Piece, and Sailor Moon and crap like that. They stereotype the Japanese so much, thinking that they're convincingly passing themselves off as Japanese. Squinting their eyes, eating food like rice cakes and sushi as their lunch (I'm not even joking, they actually take that to school as their lunches), and they can't even tell the difference between Japaneese, Chinese, and Korean, so they try to impersonate the Japanese and get a bunch of Chinese and Korean stereotypes mixed in there too and make themselves look like complete idiots, having no Idea what the hell they're doing. Oh, and if I ever hear one of them say the word "Waifu" or "Husbanu" one more time, I am going to shoot myself in the forehead. Oh, and just wait for this last part, you're going to love this. The weaaboos at my school actually call the Asian kids at my school weaboos and say they're just faking it. Yeah, I'm dead serious. What the hell is wrong with these stupid weeaboos? It's just so stupid I hate those retards so much.
Am I the only one who gets hard when he speaks Japanese.
love this guy he's right in so meany ways
Franky would you please go to the closet with me?
This should be shown to everyone that portrays an anime character on youtube, you all know that annoying asshole that puts his name as like Naruto or any character and than acts as though he is him and basically writes a fanfiction with whatever he says by talking to another annoying asshole that's doing the same thing.
Why did I just see this now. I fucking love you man. Best. Shit. Ever.
Upon viewing this video, (my second or third Filthy Frank video in a row) I have to wonder; what is Frank like in his day to day life when he isn't doing videos?
weeaboos are fucking disgusting, i know a couple of people that are weeaboos.
holy shit they smell fucking nasty.
can i please enter the weeaboo protection chamber?
Weeaboos scare me so much, I have to bring a lighter and axe spray
I laughed to hard.
Omg i laughed too hard at this xD Subscribed!

My favorite thing is when people constantly throw the word "otaku" around like OMG GUYZ IM SUCH AN OTAKU I LUV JAPAN without realizing that the word has an extremely negative connotation in Japanese culture. Also, every time I hear people use the words kawaii or sugoi in the middle of English sentences I lose a bit of my sanity.
In all honesty I think bronies are way worse when it comes to avatars. I change mine regularly
I have learned alot about myself, thank you filthy frank. I can finally move on
Hilarious
hahahhahaha! "My nameu isu cowbow Tanaka"
There are some anime that I'd kill to be in. :)
I fucking love you!!!!!!
Two macbooks fam, hit me up w/ a new one.
Two videos got me to laugh, I am subscribed senpai.
You need to talk about the....the uh...the Bronies. Oh God, just puked a little bit.
‚ÄúFucking weeaboos goin' to Japan and expecting subtitles‚Äù
Slow clap
Also, Fuck anybody that puts baka/otaku in their Nickname and then doesn't even know how to write ‚ÄúI eat ass‚Äùin japanese
Fucking weeaboo scrubs
Omg I'm a weaboo, pls send help. What should I do?
Is he full asian?
Thank you based Franku for this video.

Seriously, the time spent watching chink cartoons and reading mango could be spent on something that matters like trying to do Goatse for your bae~

Or you could just go play a fucking instrument or something.
This show is dysfunctional piece of shit.

I love it.
Having an anime profile picture and saying shit like Kawaii and Sugoi halfway through a sentence in english is like having a battlefield profile pic and saying "Roger" every time someone tells you to do something.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE EVEN COMPLAINING ABOUT!
Ruaidhri Conroy is a weeabo
I play league of legend and i hate frence player and korean are god at this game...fuk u dota2 fans
I think I hate weeaboos the most on the Internet :/
If they went into the Weeaboo protection chamber, then how did Weeaboo Jones get in? XD
Thank you for this video.
hah i laughed alot. And to the people here who say that anime expertise in not a thing and mocking people who watched more like 200+ anime: Dude are you 14? You know that there are people who watched this shit for years and still going? Its the casuals again trying to talk about something they dont know shit. Go back to leddit or 4chen faggots.
I like anime, I do want to move to japan to see how it is. I don't want to be Japanese though.
i think if its all katanas you got a problem, but if you have some katanas but other types of weapons
Wat...did..I..watch....
But I agree, weeaboos need to calm...
U can't learn everything bout Japan from Anime
Glad to see somebody making the distinction. Japan is actually a slightly backwards country with a stagnant economy and a rapidly ageing population, not some "UGUUU" moefestu‚Ä¶ Wait. I CAN'T COMMENT ON THIS SHIT, MUST CHANGE PROFILE PIC
Snopp
w-w-where are the subtitles? i dieded, i am posting this from the grave xD
I died at 6:58, that killed me
This is called weeaboo?? i thought it only was¬†

1. Watch anime
2. Talk about it sometimes.
3. Have a picture..


seems it was more extreme
[ BREATHES HEAVILY AND POUNDS ON KEYBOARD FULL CAPS ]
Lol the black guy w/ the body pillow in the closing montage got jailed for child porn
or i forgot to say ur subtitles are wrong for who dont understand japanese x3
and uhh...this is the first ff video ive watched (friend showed me) and i saw salamander man i was like....so this is why my older brother makes that face and rubs his nipples at me... i blame u o.o
there are weeaboos everywhere in my school o.o they dont stfu...once u say something like...anything just say kirito for example and BAM half the class is in your face trying to suck ur dick
looks like 460 weeabos watched this video, I show this video to whoever is a weeabo, i m Just a normal anime fan , ¬†I can't stand weeabos at all . Everyday ¬†I see at least 100 weeabos on FB, I just say one bad thing about their favourite anime and they go berserk, I get sick of them using Japanese Words on the comment sections. I hope You see this Frank . BTW Nice Video , It made my day.
I'm coming out with this:

I watch anime, and it's a hobby. I just don't like the cartoons they have these days. I miss the old days of Cartoon Network. But there is no way I'm going to waste money on anime stuff. I have my own passions in life, and it does not involve running off to Japan in a sailor costume. Japan is not what you think it is, either. Most people there are kind of depressed, really.
On a serious note... is Rosetta stone not good to learn a different language on? I want to learn Spanish...
O.K. you lil pig fucking weeaboo trash, let's clear some shit up. Anime is an abbreviation of the word animation, meaning that Anime is a form of animation. Do you know what else is animation? CARTOONS. Anime is a form of cartoon, and like cartoons, they have a plot, characters, storyline, development. Anime is just a genre of cartoon, so to all weeaboos out there, check your facts.
Filthy Weebs
Please notice me Frank-senpai.

I think your videos are very kawaii and you make my kokoro go doki-doki suru.
this is that type of video where you don't notice you have a raging boner until after the video is finished and your grandma was in the room so now shit is mad awkward but your grandma slowly unzips your pants and you're surprisingly okay with this and so is she. after the sex, your grandmother lights up a cigarette but dies from inhaling too much smoke. you run to your mom's room crying because your grandma just died but it's too late. All you see is me, plowing down on your mom's ass, fucking her into the next dimension. I am now your father. "Go to your fucking room and do your work. none of them stupid computer games for a whole week" i say as i chug another beer. and kids that's how I, Ted Mosby, met your mother continues to beat kids ¬†- the story of literally every white kid in lower middle class homes from the 90's old blink-182 plays ¬†"parents suuuUUUUuUuUUuuck" Ted Mosby comes back and breaks the stereo he's drunk as shit and unstoppable. "I'll fucking beat your ass", says Ted, as he grabs your vintage baseball bat signed by some black player from the 80's or some shit and swings full force into your jaw. you can't speak. you call for your mom but Ted Mosby has already killed her too. Ted Mosby breaks the window open and cartwheels into the sky on his JD Razor. Ted Mosby is king. Ted Mosby will fuck you.
I dont know All about the Haters but Filthyfrank Show is Just funny How he makes mad all the Haters, He deserves a Medal
YEAH SHOUTOUT TO WHITE DAD
Anime sucks
This guys funny and all, but he doesn't know shit about what he's talking about. I do understand that there are fucking weirdos who fuck pillows like fucking losers but not all weeaboos are like that, you're just a judgmental bastard who thinks that because 5% of weeaboos are into that shit ALL weeaboos are into it. That's not how it works, let me show you an example:

If a black man robs a store, does that make all men robbers? No.

Also what the fuck's the problem if someone wants to learn Japanese because of anime huh? Ever heard of inspiration? Think before you say shit.
ok i understand if they say they learn japanese on rosetta stone but ok so basically cosplayers are weeabos now?
and alot of cosplayers have more subscribers than u do and its because they r nice and your just a jerk.
waits for haters to come and starts awkwardly laughing
you have WHAT in your closet ?!?!?!??!
I like Pokemon.........
Plz send help my school is full of weeaboos I haven't got much time left.
Are you really 52? You seem like you're in your twenties.
you have 2 dead jewish people in your closet?
This video was quite good
Rasengan... Rasengan... ROSETTA STONED.

waits for a hate comments to come down
Let's start a comment chain





You clicked read more
sticks and stones may brake my bones, but i will always be one step ahead of you
The pigeon part was brilliant.
I have an ALF body pillow
I have 1 katana and will only have one ¬†(it was $10) and I collect manga and anime. That's as far as I will go. Waifu pillows would make me look like a creep. Collecting figures of half naked anime girls too. Cosplaying also seems pretty gay and I hate weeaboos who attempt to speak japanese and think anime can ONLY be watched in Japanese
cory in the house and king of the hill are best anime

Fucking dead.
Have you ever seen the weeaboo FB posts? I mean seriously, the memes an unbelievable amount of spelling/gramatical errors so it just makes them look like dimwits.
I stumbled across a post that said something along the lines of "I'll kill your brain cells if you say you hate anime" OKAY. For one, not everyone has to agree with your opinion. I love anime but I'd rather keep the hobby to myself and friends who like anime (without it being shoved down). And two, I don't understand their statement of "killing brain cells." I feel like that post killed my brain cells enough already...
9:56 Is that PBG? Tell me if he is really a weeaboo or a troll so I know whether to unsubb or not.
Nothing wrong with buying cosplay items like replica katanas from bleach for example... It's fun to cosplay at supernova or at comicon for america. Also what is up with this guys voice? Is that just his ranting voice or what it's kind of putting me off the funny script.
I JUST WANTED A PIECE OF THE HELICOPTER'S ASS
9:10 looks more like a fa/tg/uy than a weaboo. He doesn't appear to have any japanshit.
Weeaboos annoy me more than that fag from big bang theory.
nice meme there
~9gag
I laugh at all the weeaboos defending themselves in the comments, justifying their anime profile pics topkek
"I've had so much sex with my body pillow that it stands on its own now." - That sentence nearly killed me, hahaha.
man fuck anime that shit is gay fucking cartoon loveing nerds
That's cool I guess.
heavily breathes
Weaboos deserve to die.
razor
I wonder if "cowboy Tanaka" is fine after weeaboos attack :(
Omg my step sister is exactly like this. So true. I love this show!
9:28 I think thats just a emo guy getting arrested.
why everybody in the comments is a fucking weeabo
I want to collect guns, and i watch anime, does that make me a weaboo?
Filthy Frank you're my waifu.
Youkoso watashi no namae wa weeaboo jones desu bitch!
People who use Urban Dictionary to make a point are great.
Justin bieber is bettter than all this Weeaboos! he has a life and you guys don't.
THE WEEABOS ARE A RESPECTED CULTURE JUST LIKE THE FILTHY FRANK SHOW FAN BASS YES BASS DROP THAT BASS LIKE YOU DROP THAT PILLOW LAST NIGHT O I WAIT THAT WAS ME....
This is the first vid of yours that I watched and I'm literally crying of laughter!! SUBSCRIBED!!!
3:20 so fucking true I said one derogatory statement (fact) about weeaboos with their anime profile picture on twitter and OVER TWENTY FUCKING FIVE basement dwellers attacked me. I was shocked at the amount of autism that attacked me all at once. But I am a better person no matter what I do in life for I am not a weeaboo. :) #fact
+GoldenAvenger593¬†XD so you.
I also wanted to be Thomas the Tank Engine, but it never happen 
PS: Gordon is a fatass
i kinda hate you
There are so many weeaboos at my school I NEED I weeaboo protection program
I love you Frank but Melon Pan is untouchable.

Best Video Evah!!

Hahaha XD this is so funny !
i could never get into these shitty anime shows or whatever, I cringe from as early as the titles, but when that gay intro song (that almost all anime has) I close the window and just nope the fuck outta there
This guy is great xD
Make fun of bronies and furries pls bossss
What's really wrong with anime avatars? I just like the art...
Attack on Titan is decent.
Weeaboos:

//heavy breathing/
//types really fast/
//rants about this video/

Me: //looks at profile pic and name/ oh shit. I'm a weeaboo 

(Dramatic music plays in background)
I saw some kunais :)
Yo fuckboi bring me a piece of dat ass
Thank you this disease has gone on long enough I fucking love anime but anyone who is not Japanese should not do things that weaboos do
I love Cory in da House, nigga.
anime is bad and you should feel bad






lol ok i like watching anime as well
About time someone made a video on the stupid Weeaboos. Especially by a good YouTuber like Filthy Frank.
erm.......soo...........what are the names of the 2 prime ministers u killed......
4:10
hahaha holy shit, Frank your pronunciation is amazing.
Konnichiwa Senpai! Please notice me...
Your Japanese is unbelievable, considering you are part of it xD
On point on the voices too x'D
I can't wait for a furry video.
HE'S FUCKING WHITE VERSION OF GUS FRING!!!!
Just because you watch a few animes like FMA or Code Geass doesn't make you a weeaboo. Its only when you're obsessed with Japanese culture that it becomes an issue.
I think you should focus on the brony or the furry community
xDDDDDD
This deserves way more views
PAPA FRANKU, I HAVE SUGGESTION GIVEN ME FROM THE DARK LORD CHIN CHIN. MAKE FUN OF WEHRABOOS...THEY ARE WEEABOOS BUT ON THE GERMAN SIDE!

They wished Nazis won the war
They say German technology is superior to everything
They give OP bias remarks about german war machines
They do everything german, like drink beer, listen to rammstein and want to dress up like schutzstaffel officers.
Fact : 70% of youtube users using anime images for their youtube profiles.
Frank, ur the man :D
Am I a weeaboo if I am not Japanese but like the language itself and want to learn it? Also want to learn German but there's no disgraceful hatred towards that filth.
do one on bronies
rosetta stone
Notice me Franku 4:10 is just priceless
888/88 M8

iR8 8888/8888888888 Gr8
I think japanese culture is interesting and really want to learn the language and you gotta love that anime though :)
fuck anime
Still completely accurate.
What anime is the girl at 10:01
I know all about japanese culture and i have watched boku no pico 3 times.
(that is where i learned japanese)
I actually do collect weapons thouoh? XD
not just japanese shit too. I mean... I Got A REAL fucking sword.
Fuck the katana.
Buy a khopesh ya little bitches.
Cory in the House is best anime
There is a difference between Otaku (yes, Otaku is used as a term for unhealthy obsession, I know) and Weeaboos.
Otaku are simply hardcore fans of Anime/Manga who realize everything Franku-senpai said in this video, while Weeaboos are, well, fucking Weeaboos.
I collect weapons, yes.
I collect them because I find the craftsmanship and use of given weapons intriguing.
This means that, among others, I own several different Japanese swords.
However, this does not make me a freak or a weeaboo.
¬†Just wanted to clear up some possible misconceptions.

No offense to anybody but Weeaboos are the most annoying damn thing on the planet. Specially when you watching English dub Anime. They talk about every little thing about what's wrong with it. They think they're an expert when it comes to voice acting.
One of these monsters got arrested at the town next to mine. They had a katana and was yelling at people.
Got a confused boner at 9:43 -_-
Cory in the house... best anime ever.
spoiler alert naruto dies.
What is the name of the song at 6:41?
I swear to god if someone comments: "darude - sandstorm"...

We all know that piece of shit song is not Franku material.

All I want is a list of music papa franku uses mane.

b0ss pls gibe de musik b0ss

b0ss pls
HENTAII
I feel like its ok if your attractive
I think the only thing here I'm guilty of is my obsession with blades. Knives, swords, whatever. Anything that one would generally consider a blade, I will be interested. I actually know quite a bit of swordplay/fighting, thanks to my childhood.
facepalm
Franku Senpai is the reason why I have AIDs <3
Something dead in your closet...?
Frank you are a true inspiration to us pink army members may them weeabos not gt you!
Would it be weeaboo-like if I made a katana?
Hey I have never watched anime and I'm Japanese, does that make me an antiweeaboo. Wooooooo
Lol some of these pic arent weeaboos XD
<----- Anime avatar..... Suck it ! Actually it's from a video game.
Frank. You went to far. You fucking triggered me so hard, I am going to call Tumblr and their Social Justice Mechanized Infantry on your fucking cis-scum ass.
Watch your back, because the special snowflakes are going to make a god damned snowstorm.
   From, Tumblr.
sum fun¬†( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
i know japanese and like chop sticks and have katanas from my fav animes just for fan support but thats because i was raised on anime from i was younger? but i love being black jamaican am i a weaboo? :c i just love anime and japan but i dont try and be it help me someone plz ._.
Don't talk to me like that senpai. You'll hurt my feeling.
More of theese kind of videos!
Hahahahah that nerd voice is fucking spot on FilthyFrank!! So fuckin true man!
Press 0 and pause :)
Please do bronys
I always thumbs down weeaboos and bronys, and you should too.
As much as I love anime it's kind of ridiculous.
Like,
"Fighting crime in miniskirts!"
"OP aliens that become pretty blondes by screaming!"
"Save the world with card games!"
"We have to fight the TITAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANS!"
"Half-Demon with a werewolf-esque thing goin' on!"
"Rebellion! Against my OWN FATHER!"
"DADDY ISSUES!"
This is the best anime i've seen.
hi dad
I accept that I am a weaboo that loves anime and also I accept that I'm a no life nerd :) thank you filthy frank!

Love you filthy frank
6:56 BOSS!
*looks at avatar* ¬† FUCK!!!! -_-
having an anime avatar doesn't mean you have to be a weeaboo necessarily. I for example wanna show an interest while not revealing my identity to the world.
But I know it's difficult with interest in japan.
Like for example I show interest in japan since my childhood due to a japanese undergraduate staying at our house for a while who studied german here and she cooked japanese food and told us kids about her country and brought us kid-toys from back home.
But if you say you love japan and their whole culture and wanna get to know about it more and you chat with someone about and have an anime avatar they all judge you like your typical weeaboo.
You can still distinguish weeaboos through chatting cuz weeaboos use japanese emoticons a lot and say something like "chigau", "haai" "arigatou" all the time in an usual english chat and I have to admit this just is sooo freakin annoying
This was absolutely hilarious
424 weeaboos watched the video xD
Just listening to this guy talk makes my throat hurt
WHAT THE FUCK AM I WATCHING
whats the song at 7:20
Nothing better, then to fap to good old fashion loli hentai.
It is rather sickening when grown ass adults buy swords and headbands which aren't even gonna be useful. Taking the time to dress up like those anime characters is also insane. This is what happens when you are too lonely.
BTW the girls at 9:23 are really hot and 2 of the male weaboos weren't bad looking to my surprise.
Godfuckingdammit Frank!!
I'm sick and started laughing so fucking hard i got into a coughing fit and 'bout nearly died from my lungs collapsing cause i couldn't stop laughing! shit, dude, this was an experience.
awesomesauce.
I am anime fan I have good pay job I got anime weapons I have my own home with a Xbox one and ps4 I know Japanese culture I study in Japan during my summer break I was the class president in school and anime club president also I'm top student in my class number 1 and graduated and all thanks to anime
Can u pplz add sub for the video :3
It will be great. Ty
Poor Percy.
a diss vid on bronys/furrys please
Why can't there be a weaboo awareness day?
Lol I almost died when you said you wanted to be Thomas the train.
Make fun of Homestuck!! OuO 

Yeah I'm a huge fan of it, I wanna see what would happen. XD
Yeah i got an anima pic she got her tities blasted boi heavy breathing what did you just say to me m80 wadihbdhbwfhwbdfijbwpfjonwaihdfwJFBAJOFBjfnwhBFJAWF Lwbf;FH
I JUST WANTED TO EAT A PIECE OF PERCY'S ASS
I like how people post comments about how they only "casually" like anime to reaffirm their belief that they're not actually a weeaboo. I'm glad you like anime guys, but you don't have to look to youtube to reaffirm your insecurities of being labeled a weeaboo. In all honesty, no matter what you fucking say, the main comeback line for those who are weeaboo haters, is "You probably have Autism" "Why don't you get out of your moms basement you weeb." or they just outright mock you when you insist that your not the anime loving faggot they say you are.
:D
Well who doesnt know even if its true
My waifu can beat up your're waifu
Can you please make a video about people who call themselves otaku's??
What is wrong with this poor man's voice?
in Portugal there are ONLY¬†5% of WEEABOOS¬†!!!
Rosetta Stone!
The closed captions destroyed my sides...
What I got from the intro is that you have two dead people in your closet. The subtitles aren't very accurate.
Can you make fun of bronies or some other fandom, I just fucking love this video plz.
those mad after effects skillz
I was an weeaboo before actually living in Japan for 3 months... I still cry.
weaboos may be bad, but they do not even compare to how bad hardcore bronies are.
i feel u will become Tomas tha train someday :)
Frank should rip on weeaboos again
6:28 LOL "We have to run"
he actually said "i love cunts/pussy"
I saw Attack on Titan hoping to watch a good show...
Animations and soundtrack is ok, but the rest....oh god...

I can't understand why even weeaboos like it.
Stupid chinese cartoons make no sense to me. How do people watch this shit?
i could NOT be the camera man.. id be fucking dying every second while recording
MOTHERFUCKER!!!! why must you be so goddamn funny?
I was unaware of this term "weeaboo" until now.

My roommate has a friend who comes over all decked out in Anime clothes, speaking (what I assume is) broken Japanese (or maybe it is flawless...  I dunno) and only talking about his katana collection and Anime he is/has watched.  

I just called him "a fucking clown shoe" for the longest time.  Never to his face, that would be hurtful and rude.  Talking behind his back is the only acceptable way to deal with him.

Once I went over his house to pick my roommate up and it looks like I walked into a cartoon.  A cartoon with several life sized cutouts of Anime characters, many many katana on the walls and his computer is CONSTANTLY playing some form of J-Pop.

Thank you Franku.  You have bestowed me with a new weapon that is sure to make my name calling and degradation that much more hurtful.

You deserve a gift.
Funniest thing about this is all the weeboos in the comments pretending to hate weeboos to hide their shame.
At 3:43 put on subtitles
Nummy
This reminds me of my older brother too much. Damned weeaboos got him
This was beaut, thank you Franku Senpai<3 Please, take the advice and do one about Bronies. Ore wa ochinchin ga daisuke dayo.
Frank, why I laugh at your videos every fucking time like a sick horse, but when it comes to my friends, nobody is laughing, but crying and swearing and killing themselves???
0:10...
What it said in the subtitle...
that's not what you really said...
I know this because I'm from Kochi, Japan. In short, I speak and understand Japanese...¬†I want the names of those in your closet, please, and also how they died. Also. 4:11
I CAN SO RELATE TO HOW YOU FEEL WHEN THEY TALK LIKE REAL JAPANESE PEOPLE TALK AND ACT LIKE ANIME CHARACTERS.
I laughed and now I feel warm.
cool.
415 weeaboos have been it with a reality check
This guy's cameraman must have the best or the worst job in the world
>watching chinese cartoons

Everyone laughs.
Do people actually like attack on titan unironically? I mean its babies first shouen
Now, you see, I need to know if that pic at 1:18 - 1:19 is from a VN or just an image.

Either way, I need to know it's source.
This is 75% of PS4 fans summed up. ¬†All weeaboos using those crappy JRPG's and Flower as mental masturbation.
There are people who use anime characters as their profile picture?¬† ...smh.

Japanophile. I honestly think Weeaboo's are trying to shove their fingers in the butt of Japan.
1:32
You need to watch some real animes! Such as Arthur, Breaking Bad, King of the Hill, Walking Dead, Malcom in the Middle and The Dirty Dozen.
10:09 Not that I respect Chris Chan in any way shape or form, but how is he a Weaboo?
XD oh my god
Fuck me while speaking to me in Japanese.
This video is a huge breath of fresh air. However I'm actually learning Japanese on Rosetta stone so I can understand it's media and culture better. Why all the hate on that?
I'm a brony and make fun of us i wanna laugh i LOVE THIS SHOW
i watch cartoons anime(chinese cartoons) in my language, i don't give a shit of the original language lol, japanese? fucking uncomprensible hahahaha

corey in the house is best anime
So why does weeaboo jones walk retarded and half a huge gut lump?
Ahh good, I am not a Weeaboo then, I knew my bastard of a pal was incorrect. I love the culture, the language, the shows. But there is no way in the world I shall go.¬†

im supposed to be studying for fucking finals and now im watching this shit
Are you ready to have some fun: "There are two people in my clauset"
I sure am!: "They're both dead"
I lol'd so hard once I realized it.
I just think anime is a change of pace from American shows. ¬†I prefer it over other genres, but not so much to the point where I'm annoying (I think). ¬†I'm able to hold a conversation about anime. ¬†It's just something I watch on my downtime. ¬†But when I'm talking about anime with a friend and some weeaboo comes up to me and is like "OH MY GOD I HEARD YOU LIKE ANIME! ¬†INUYASHA AND HOMESTUCK ARE PROBABLY THE BEST THINGS THAT HAVE COME FROM THE JAPANESE CULTURE!" I want to punch them in the face. ¬†So yes. ¬†Weeaboos are very annoying.
my favorite anime is tom and jerry
phrinku best animu
i like how no one really talks about the fact that safari man always says "ore wa manko ga daisuki"
5:49 The "My genital" guy! What a legend.
i am a japanophile
When weeaboos declared that their otakus as if its any better...
I seriously hate weeaboos. Someone called me a weeaboo, even though I'm Japanese, and don't watch anime. And they are Asian as well. Korean actually. And it just pissed me off cause that's full blown racism.
You can be Tank engine..

Though the anime's at the top are still good, they are only just mainstreamed on Netflix or something. If you beg to differ or have something else in mind, I'm right here :)
im dying
Scott looks pretty bad ass with his new sword (9:10)
Lmfao, the cowboy asian part is in fact Jimmy Wang Yang. He used to wrestle for the WWE. Prob still do
Next, he's gotta talk about furries and bronies..
He drinks Arizona Green Tea like I do.......I am now a loyal subscriber Papa Franku :V
Attack On Titan is so fucking overrated. Boku No Pico and Watamote are the best animes. And oh god not this shit again with Cory In The House
i'm going to CUM in my cartoon wife 1,000 times
HARDCORE WEEABOO HEREEE
So is Rosetta Stone a trash way of learning languages? Or just the Japanese program?
Papa franku, we need a serious discussion on Brony faggots, they are just as bad as weeaboo shit lords.
yeah yeah tho you should really get smt straight anime and cartoon have a lot differences
Kudos on the subtle subtitle trolling in the beginning.
having an anime icon isn't a bad thing....its like someone having an actor as your icon; it's to show a hobby.
I was friends with someone who was like weaboo but for Korea instead; ugh it was the most annoying thing in the world. She use to have this whole "KOREA IS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY EVER!" calling me 'big sister' in korean or some shit.
But weaboos who believe that by liking anime in Japan you'll have a good time it in no way correct; people fucking hate otakus in Japan
Anime is one of the few things I truly like. White people tv is unbearable. And white activities are unbearable to so fuck you. Ill be a freaky weeaboo until white people learn to make content worth looking at.
YAOI CHECK!!! YAOI CHECK!!!
you took this too far asshole
Damn, he threw Chris-Chan in there
I just started watching this channel :)
you're not really Japanese until you do weird shit like this...
wow the comments are shit here
So funny! ^_^

4:52 is my new text tone for my boyfriend.¬†
Cause you know he gets all that mad pussy
America has everything bigger than japan. Everything.





fite me m8
Are you ready to have some fun?
a rasengan up the ass sounds both hilarious and fucked up
Anime is fucking stupid and embarrassing.
Please do one about bronies...¬† XD being a huge fan of mlp myself, I would get a huge laugh out of it. As much as I enjoy the show, I hate most of¬†the fandom.
the worst kind of WEEABOO is the one that never watched animes than it started cause it's popular
Belly laughs intensively
LOL
Was Weeaboo Jones a reference to Jigaboo Jones?
What if i make sharp things myself? OwO
I love how correct he is and everyone's yelling at him
Nothing like self-denying weeaboos attacking other weeaboos to be superior. Fucking weeaboo.
I used to be one but luckily I found the cure. Let's say
It was
A "miracle"
lol what? 2 people are in his closet, and they're both dead??
hey, it's good to hear the jews are being reduced. hitler was a true hero
Freeaboo
Rosetta Stone
lmfao this guy is a fuckin clown haha
watching you is like dropping acid with out the downside of burned out neurons
You'll hurt your voice like that. If you keep it up.
9:56 didnt know PBG was a weeb
0:09 what about two people in your closet... And dead??
I subscribe now
Thats just plain funny
thank you
EXSCALLLLIBUUUUR
I've always wanted to violently fuck Percy and Harold viciously as well, Frank. You're not alone.
Harass the brownies please

This video pretty much is an accurate deconstruction of the weeaboo/otaku culture.
herro my nem issu cowboy taraka
Hey Frank! Can we use your video for our seminar to correct this Filth!
You know... It's very possible to be a weeabo without being like how he describes them... Very possible
lol fuck anime.
Filthy Frank is the shit
What is wrong with his upper lip?
Now do one on bronies
i like anime . and i wish to go to japan myself one day cause i fricking love to travel . and i think that people get super defensive over anime is that ¬†there are alote of people who make fun of anime and bully people about it. i witnessed myself . its probably a self mechanism that makes theese people so defensive XD.just ¬†like how people are to xbox and ps3 . ¬†my opinion , dont judge me please.
casually stares at profile picture

...iamnotaweeaboo
I thought he said "King Kai,King Kai!" When he said pink guy.
I would buy a set of katana's, but never because I liked anime. I'd buy it with a set of other knives like Swiss Army Knives, gut knives, etc., and I'd do it because I loved weapons. Not because of some show.
I have to admit something... I... Collect weapons. Guns mostly these days. It started with an oniyuri. I've never had one of those wall hangers. I blame my older brother for making me and my other bro fight it out with bamboo "swords" when we were younger.
I agree with Frank but wtf did I just watch
its just a thought out of the back of my head
Fanku's wails of terror at 7:57 gave me a stone cold erection.
"I knew this day would come"
He says that every time. Maybe if he actually told us what he knew what was going to come, on I don't know maybe some sort of fucking calender, then maybe SHIT LIKE THIS WOULDN'T GET OUTTA HAND!
MasterFX
cawboi taraka
This editing is fucking beautiful.
Did no one hear about the 2 dead Jews in FilthyFrank's the closet from the misdirecting subtitles in the beginning?..lol...thought I'd point it out like a killjoy
You should make a video about bronies and furries. Like damn, if you ever see one of them you should stay away.
Voice crack babe
Yung lean ad
i love you
1:57 is me in a nutshell.
Weeaboos are gayyy
+TVFilthyFrank¬† FILTHYFRANK IS LIFE. FILTHYFRANK IS LOVE. FILTHYFRANK IS SENPAI
I think I love this guy
Cory in the House is the best anime ever. The dub is ok but I prefer sub.
You EW a fagg giot git git.
my waifu is coming to laifu
You almost sound like batman from the dark knight.
Yeah, your so much better of a person than the people your making fun of in this video. Your voice sounds like pigeon shit and your comedy is reminiscent of what I might hear on a middle school playground.
Seinfeld is my favorite anime.
give me the pussy boss
I always watch this haha. and make my friends watch this so they can stop being a weeaboo.
ey b0ss
6:58
That's a good explanation of "otakus"
I like anime and I sort of want to visit Japan for a few days (though I don't plan on staying there forever) does this make me a weeaboo?
Papa Franku's train dreams.

I love you

eventhoughihaveavatarsandshit
MOSHI MOSHI JESUS DESU
Sometimes I say something online and I can LITERALLY FEEL the weeaboos heavily breathing and coming closer about to begin a thing
I think collecting weapons is alright. A friend of mine has a Katana, he doesnt even like anime or give a shit about japan. He just likes Weapons. I think its pretty cool. Used it myself, cut some small trees and stuff, pretty fun. We never pretended to be some anime characters like fags tough.
I mean, I do watch anime, and I am going to visit Japan someday, but it isnt because im a weaboo, its just im i terested in their culture and want to experience it first hand.
Collecting things from anime like katanas are more like decoration. It's art in its self :/ And people also misuse the word "weeaboo" on people whom actually are decent, not the crazy ones. We fangirls over a lot of things, but we're not as crazy as the most Justin Bieber fans whom actually killed themselves when he got a girlfriend. -.-
We cosplay because it's fun. We collect anime stuff because we like them and want to decorate the boring everyday room with something funny/cute/cool.
And there ARE people whom loves Japanese culture and respects it, but even so are being called "weeaboos". Me for example, am studying different languages, cultures and art styles. And as soon as I get to the Japanese art topic I get the word "weeaboo" thrown at me right away.
If you are going to call someone that, at least have your facts straight. (And yeah I do agree that weeaboos are pretty scary and weird... :L)
7:47 best part
seinfeld is my favorite anime :))))
6:18 Da Funk?
What does he mean when he says the body pillow stands on its on
I've been on Youtube since the beginning, how have I never heard of this guy? LMAO
nah cory in the house aint good and toy story is shit. now king of the hill. THATS WHERE ITS AT
384 of 385 people who disliked this video are most likely weeaboos, but 1 of them has to be be white dad.
I find you hilarious Frank, but at the same time I just feel so bad for your vocal chords, hope you're taking care of them :)
fuckin weeaboos though.....I see them everywhere, in any video involving, japan, cartoons, anime, remotely they will be there talkin smack and saying how great anime is and that japanese culture is, nigga wot do u know, you live in a filthy ass room full of old crt tv's , anime box sets, posters of characters from anime and fuckin manga, and waifus (however they are spelt)¬†
PS loved your impression of anime characters, with their wierd screaming/shouting all the time, it was great
I love how even your Japanese sounds harsh and kind of like ... street-punk. xD
Talk about kids who try to make a gaming channel
YEes! YEEEEES!
This has to be my favorite video of all time.
What did you do with the dead bodies in your closet.
what is the music that plays in the background
Kappa
By far my favorite vide0 from Papa Franku.
I almost threw up at the weeaboo song part. Also, we need to see more weeaboo Jones.
jesus 5:10 kills me everytime
Made the mistake of watching this while eating soup. Never again
Am i the only one who actually sees no problem in collecting katana?
I mean...Collections can be made of anything, as long as it's something you like it, it can range from something simple such as stamps to something expensive and huge like cars...So what's the problem in collecting a certain type of sword?
also all you fucking 3rd world asian countries, that goes for you too, YEAH YOU FUCKING WEABS, DIE. Including the Philippines and such island countries. Be fucking proud about who you are you piece of shits.
What the fuck, this son of a bitch needs to bash on some of those fucking Bronies, those goddamn pony boys. Fruit basket holding motherfuckers.
Was.....Was that a little... voice crack I heard at 1:04? Papa, that's awfully strange.
I spotted your bamboo tablet, you an artist +TVFilthyFrank¬†???
you watch mad hentai brah, don't lie
1:18 what anime/manga is that?... I need to know for... science...
i lost my girlfriend to a weeaboo
and my dignity went with it, now i have nothing left to live for
rosetta stone
I collect Nazi weapons no joke
This man sounds like a diseased frog with throat cancer.
WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE FILTHY FRANK, YOU ACT LIKE PEOPLE WHO APPRECIATE JAPANESE CULTURE ARE WEABOOS. ACCORDING TO MY FAVORITE ANIME ATTACK ON TITAN, WE SHOULD ALL JUST GET ALONG. JUST BECAUSE I LIVE WITH MY MOM, APPRECIATE ASAIN CULTURE, MASTURBATE TO HENTAI, OR HAVE A WAIFU PILLOW DOESNT MEAN YOU CAN JUST GO AROUND AND CALL ME NAMES. I AM UNSUBSCRIBING AND TELLING ALL OF MY FRIENDS TO DO THE SAME. FUCK YOU
3:25 XD
REALITY CHECK HAHAHAHAHA
Weaboo jones is a new character?
So, if I understand this, if you have an anime profile picture you are automatically a weeaboo. Is this the logic everyone goes by?
weeaboo jones sounds like the godfather
Hmmm....Cosplay doesn't really define weeaboos...Having:
Body pillows
Acting like your Japanese
Defending against anime
are all weaboos

Going to japan and learning the language and the culture is fine
What is the music in the weeaboo protection chamber ??
1:57 is so me,... Dawm it!
I think a well-written movie starring all of the Filthy Frank characters would be the best thing to happen to the world. Think about it; the main protagonists would be Frank, Red dick and Prometheus who go on a journey to round up the other characters like Pink Guy, Salamander Man etc. to fight off Chin Chin and his army of autistic, cringe-worthy fucks. I'd pay money to see that shit! Not really though, I need the money.
* types while breathing really hard, specifically typing about your acknowledgment of people who like anime hardcore in all caps *
i love when you can see him laughing at himself when the frame jumps
Anime belongs in the garbage
Ya know, its kinda weird how people judge so openly over the internet yet when it comes face to face silence is golden.
Everyone who keeps asking "if I do this and that, am I a weeaboo" must be a little insecure about themselves.

btw Grey's Anatomy is the best anime
IM DYING XDDDDDD alot of comic CON's population are weeaboos sadly.
You know what? That weeaboo montage was nostalgic as fuck..
i like anime... o.o but im not a weeaboo :3
I would consider my self a Weaboo but I've decided to leave the culture because my Waifu has become abusive..
That voice acting though xD Impressive. Love your videos btw.
Anime avatars? Pfff....
Thanks to this video I actively attack WEEABOOS on Ifunny
I've been called a weaboo before, but yhis is fucking histerical. Almost had me falling off the couch. I just like the japanese culture, certain fashion, and anime, but I don't go around acting like I know everything like actual "weaboos" do. I don't like spreading ignorance, so I try to stick to the things I do know. I do wish to visit japan to learn more about their culture in person. The best way to learn about a place is to go to that place in my opinion.
I have a katana for self defense, watch anime OCCASIONALLY, have a balance social life, and I hate the thought and idea of hentai. Phew, i'm safe.
You should make fun of capitalism.
do one about bronies you faggot
WTF IS WRONG WITH YOUR VOICE ._.
fuck me your so informative
+TVFilthyFrank¬†What do I do if I find out that my friend is a weeaboo?
brony's are worse than weaboos
Wait, so am i a weeaboo if i want to learn japanese to watch anime without subtitles?
darude-weeaboos
I am actually Japanese and weeaboos piss me off so much. Oh, and my profile picture isn't for an anime it's just a cool picture of a robot Samurai.
oh, just spotted melon pan as expected
Tbh weaboos disgust me.
Anyone that watches MLP is a weeaboo.
What about furries?
he said there are two jewish guy in my closet in japanese
but, but... i like samurais :(
fuck me this is great
I am a WEEABOO and there is so much love in this. Very tasteful and hilarious. I love how you even said the awesome words "IYAA!!"

And then later you even said "YAMAETE!"

Or how the weeaboo's ability was SHARINGAN but he said RASENGAN

Thank you for creating such a masterpiece!
Wait, I have a Pokemon as my profile pic, enjoy anime and am leaning Japanese. Does that mean I'm a Weeaboo?! FUUUUUCCK!!!
I feel the exact same way. I couldn't have said any of this better. I hate weeabos.
I want to get an anime avatar ¬†because of this.
I'm laughing my sphincter out @ 0:09 because he said "I have two Jews in the closet, and they're both dead."
I used to be a weeaboo....never again
Black people smell like chicken
Great video xD so funny
4:25¬†
Borderline?
I don't mind anime that much but making fun of naruto is okay I guess but people have there opions on what they like I like some anime and not so much on the fan favor ;) jk jk I don't give a fuck :P
i know bankai
so can i go to japan
Cowboy Tanaka, my sides
FRANKU YOU ARE A FAGGOT
Funny and educational. Although, a weeaboo video isnt complete without a SAO reference

111!!!!!
Lol the pillow joke killed me xD

OMFG I JUST LOOKED UP WEEABOO

OH MY GOD, HEARING HIS VOICE MAKES MY THROAT HURT! PLEASE CLEAR YOUR THROAT!
Does anyone know the ukulele chords. I'm pretty sure it starts with an A.
Cory in the house is best anime.
I dont like anime. But what is wrong with his voice? Did he have an accident with his throat?
Lollll you're hilarious
So many of those images made me cringe.¬† Where do you find this stuff?
When he started to laugh when talking about Thomas the train, I couldn't keep from laughing. His laugh is infectious XD. Also, I love his Jeff Dunham fuck doll and I think that's Hila's art in the back. 10/10 would watch again.
IT'S FILTHY FRANK MOTHAFUCKAAAA
IT'S FILTHY FRANK BITCH
He Frank,
I just wanted to say that I love you too,
but I love in another way, I like as a... as a friend Frank.
I know that you may hate me after saying this after all these long awaited years for an answer.
but, it's just, it's just that I`m sorry Frank!
I already have a wife and two boys you know.
Sorry.

Regards Harold The Chopper
I fucking lost it at 3:40
i need a sword ¬†for the zombie apocalypse and i also need guns tons and ¬†tons of guns. :3
my friend may be a weeaboo how do i kill him inhumanly
God daymn!!
This is one of the funniest videos I've seen yet!
I'm dying of laughter over here, keep up the sick work!!
Literally xD
The only anime i like is pokemon.
xDDDDDD
Omg. So I got Weaaboos as friends!?!?! Oh shit! Btw I'm in love with anime, I think anime is my life... I'm just not too obsessed as in trying to learn the language or having an anime boy/girl on my pillow (wtf, I didn't even know something like that existed! LOL). Bye Franku
you attack the anime community? frank have you even seen your fan base it full of teenagers with anger issues.
Can people call me a weeaboo or otaku if i only watch anime and like it? I'm not a 'japanophile' or something like that. I just like the country and i like anime. :3
your impression at 4:10 is fucking spot on. You should totes begin voicing anime.
Am i a Weeaboo if i only pretend to be Japanese to fuck around with people?
10:11 Chis-Chan before he/she became Christal-Chan AKA "Extremely Disturbed and in need of extreme psychological help"
Also that fag lives in the same state I do. Good thing he/she live on the northern part of the state, far the fuck away from my neck 'o de woods.
7:04 CAAAAAAAAAAAN SOMEBODY GIMME DA PUSSY PLEASE!!
lol I saw the image on 9:15 on 4chan and that guy was talking shit about going to japan and how he's going to live the life has he has always wanted and¬†has a degree in some bullshit swordcrafting
I'm Japanese and I heard you say "they're both dead" and shit like four times XD
im a weeaboo
anime is for basement dwelling faggots
i wish he wouldn't yell so much
i cry evrytime so tru XD
4:27 Papa Franku realizes his drawers are open.
his reaction to the pigeon is just priceless
THE FUCK OUT
Not a day goes by that I don't cherish my vast collection of korean komics or filipino animations
What song are you using for the Weeaboo Jones part? xD
good work dude xD
Herow! Mai namu isu COWBOY Tanaka!
People who think japan really is like it gets portrayed in animes are pretty stupid but people who say anime is intrinsically bad because it portrays itself differently to real life is are equally stupid imo because come on, you think life in america is the same as it is in the iron man movies? or life in Britain is like it is in episodes of doctor who? tv shows, movies, cartoons and anime from no matter where are fantasy, it's called FICTION, not a documentary.
Franku, there is another Epidemic that is springing up into life, and is growing like a fucking tumor.. it is known as 'Homestuck' in order to spot the host for this disease, it paints itself gray, has these candy-colored horns, and really just acts bad in the general public and society. its ages range from 12-27 in its fandom. but the difference is, the shit hit the fan hardcore. the pornogrophy is getting out of hand. please Franku, help us with this Epidemic... please B0ss..¬†

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† - For the lolz
P.S. i'd appreciate it if you gimmie pussy girl...
I love anime alot and i literally couldnt stop laughing and i was tearing up cause this was so funny and i was trying so hard not to wake everyone up cause its 4 am
Weeaboos are just plain awful. They make other people who enjoy anime/manga look ridiculous and completely disrespect Japanese culture!

I've gotten the displeasure of meeting a weeb IRL... hopefully none of you will ever have to experience that.
don't forget private SNAFU!
Gotta love some good old filthy frank
Sorry to say, but the whole "anime expertise level" thing that Frank makes fun of is still a fucking legit thing, regardless of him making fun of it or not. People whom have seen more anime, and have experienced more cliches, tropes, and plots - are often considered more knowledgeable than someone who, lets say, has only seen about 20 anime total, and ONE persons facetious, satirical opinions about "anime expertise", claiming its "stupid" or "irrelevant" doesn't somehow magically make it so. Anime "expertise" IS a thing.

Anime "expertise" is a way for more experienced people to distinguish themselves from the newcommers, separates the ignorant from the educated, and often allows other people to determine who's opinion of a specific subject is more likely to be accurate or well informed.

It's like saying that you're somehow an asshole for not listening to someone who's less educated on a topic simply because the ACT of not listening to them because they're less educated on a subject seems like a dickish thing to do. Honestly I don't give a fuck if it seems like a dick move, people who've seen more anime than you, know more about anime than you - so on and so forth, are often the ones people go to first and foremost for recommendations, suggestions, and to have their questions answered.

Im sorry, but favoritism DOES exist, and it exists for a good reason. I don't give a fuck what filthyfrank says, I will - more often than not - take the advice of someone who's seen upwards into the area of 500 to 700 anime, over someone who's seen a shitty, small, irrelevant variety of anime that strike mostly in the zone of "anime for young adults", because in reality, the person who's seen 500+ anime have superior tastes, more experience, and probably know what the fuck they're talking about.

Everything else frank said is true though.
needs more emphasis on the fact that otaku = weeaboo bc there's too many weebs who claim they're not weebs bc they're just otaku like no
fucking weaboos they ruin anime for me
I burst out laughing at the xenophobic comment
While I was raping a baby rhinoceros, taking a enough acid to turn you into a vegetable, a praying to Chin Chin, I swear I thought I saw Pink Guy eating a sandwich and selling Ramen Noodle to Rick James cat. Confirm this please.
anime is trash
2:36 GOT ME LAUGHIN HARD
been seeing a lot of people calling people with anime pictures weaboos and i can't help to think that those people are idiots. the true definition of weaboo is an English slang used to describe a person (typically of non-Asian descent) who prefers Japan and all things in Japanese over one‚Äôs indigenous culture. you can like anime and have the pictures of it and still not be counted as a weaboo. by calling people like that a weaboo by that logic it is the same as calling someone an american wannabe that has an american cartoon character as a profile picture.
its funny cos i have a best friend that is indonesian and loves and anime and she goes to all these anime cons and she's at japan for a holiday atm... xD
I too wanted a piece of that sweet, sweet Percy ass. When I got frisky though, I kinda wished Gordon would ride his big train on me.
FICK YOU AND FUCK YOUR WEEABOO BUDDIES ALSO DAMMIT!!!
GET YOUR ASS OUTTA YOUR HEAD AND WAKE UP, PLEASE!!!
LMAO you can be Japanese by getting Japan's nationality lel epic FAIL
< I have an anime avatar
tbh I just like the art style
hahahaaha wtf hahaha
god damn chinese cartoons
Favorite animes:
Teletubbys 
Bob the Builder
Barney
Jay jay the jet plane
Fresh prince of bel air
i guess cory isn't the only one in the house
Attack on titan is a good show, its just that hipsters found it
Oh what if one tries to dress up like Ayatollah Khomeini? Yes in japan or in an anime convention thing that the weeaboos do.i be like yes i been learning arabic (not iranian language) from watching mujahideen videos and reading pieces of the quran (cannot read arabic at all).

Weeaboos keep typing and saying kawai desu, konichua, arigato, and other common japanese. I type and say hamdallah, insha'allah, takbir allahu akbar, jihad, caliphate, kuffar and asalam alykum, i kill you. You got katanas well guess what i got scimitars (that no one would use even if they had training and martial arts)! Got kimonos and yukata, i got thobes, perahan tunban, turbans and keffiyehs.

Doing all these thing both side have one thing in common, its pointless and unnecessary. You dont need this in order to survive i mean you can do it occasionally and in moderation but not on the "over the top" "obsessed" level so to speak. Where you deside to disown your default culture you grew up in just to cherry pick a few traits of another (particularly japanese). Cherry picking meaning you choose to mimic a few behavior(may not be a real ones) of the Japanese or any other culture while neglecting to mimic the other behaviors they do. Lol
OhMyGod.
Japan man, it's such a great country. Getting treated like garbage for being white? I'm all for that. I want to shave all my hair off and eat lots of rice and drink tea piss and get big and fat sumo wrestler and kill myself.
Sooo... everyones just gonna ignore the fact that he's got two dead jewish people in his closet?
Wigger trash ranting about weeaboo trash, the irony.
Whoa you're really 50 filthy frank? :O you look like you're in your 20s honest to god. You look pretty good for your age :D
Cory in the House is only for true anime fans!
Hahahahaha!
nigga you talking shit on attack on titan? ill give you 24 hours to say sorry or ill bring my katana to your house and kill you nigga
I have an anime avatar m8?
Pls help me exterminate my autism pls b0ss.

When will you address the furry problem
ROFL
7:58 me when i try to do homework
Sensai Franku, at school today I walked into the student lounge which is infested by weeaboos by the dozens, when I entered I yelled "I stole all your body pillows and shat in them"! Is Sensai Franku pleased?
kawaii in the streets
senpai in the sheets
hmmm... It's kinda like the equivalent to wiggers.
do people come to this video to hate on anime, some aren't bad, just the major ones in america are
Come to brazil
"I'll always be one step ahead of you... CAUSE I READ THE MANGA." Damn
I love anime and all d shit he said its actually true XD
I would say weeaboos are dumb and shit but people would just go buttangry and say I'm worse because I have an anime/mlp filthy hybrid avatar.

Remember kids, no matter what you like it's always wrong on the internet. Just don't obssess over it, specially on real life.
I'm terrified. o_o
Senpai notice me!
this must be the best fucking video on youtube period.
reallyy
6:57 for everyone who thinks thats the best "Hey B0ss" ever
Please notice me.
I DIED AT 4:10 xD
looks at the comment section "omg frank was right, the weeaboo invasion is real
I love it when Franku breaks out of character it's hilarious XD
Rant about brony's!!!!
FUCK THIS COMMENT SECTION. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FRANK YOU FUCKING FAGGOT
I wanted to go Japan because I watched a lot of Studio Ghibli and Makoto Shinkai films lately. The beautiful sceneries, the interpretations of the artist's views into art and the culture there that are quite similar in my country. Am I a fucking weaboo?
Dragonball Z is the only real anime. All the other ones are shit
FUCK ATTACK ON TITAN
And i thought i am the only guy who liked some anime (99% of anime are total crap tho) but thought that most of anime fanboys are little faggots who desperately try to be as japanese as possible to be as much different as possible from everyone else around them. And god i couldn't agree more attack on titan is some piece of shit, overhyped by weeabooos.
I have a gun collect and no I'm not from Texas. Got to be prepared for the zombies.
key word: border line
So next year on Janurary a schoolgirl from japan is going to live ¬†with me for a week....I wonder what kind of convoluted schemes await...c:
Calling someone a 'weaboo' is a derogatory word for someone who likes a different culture. It's like calling a gay a faggot, a lesbian a dyke or a black person a nigger. I mean it used to be bad to be gay so they called those people faggots/dykes. It used to be bad to be black so they called them niggers. Now all of a sudden it's bad to love another culture so you call them 'weaboos' along with a bunch of other insults. Honestly, I would always hear this argument everywhere so I had to look it up. As "annoying" as 'weaboos' are, the people who say these horrible things about them are A MILLION times WORSE. My best friend would be considered a 'weaboo', I don't blame her. Her life wasn't so great but she became obsessed with anime and soon Japanese stuff. Now she wants to go there and learn Japanese. I guess you'd consider that annoying or cancerous. I mean, immigrants who come to American who fall obsessed with the culture aren't called anything derogatory. Not even close to annoying or an epidemic--simply patriotic. This just goes to show how shitty this generation is. Humanity is taking fifty steps back because of this 'weaboo' hatred. Let them be who they want to be. Equality for all people. Either we accept 'weaboos' or we accept no one.

For everybody talking about how you respect Japanese culture and shit and say you're not a weeaboo, here's a little tip: Nobody fucking cares. Nobody cares that you aren't a weeaboo, nobody cares that you like anime, that you speak Japanese, at all. Keep it to yourselves.
Anime faggits, read a fucking book
"follow your dreams, son" gets me everytime
.....
90% of the people in the comments section fit this description.
Never understood the thought process behind having to love and respect your own culture because you were born in it. It's basically saying that critical thought and freedom to form opinions should not be applied because you were raised with it, and this is the kind of attitude that racists and zealots are formed from. Human beings have the right to like or dislike something no matter how closely they were affiliated with it at birth, because you can't control that shit. If I was born in 1930's Germany, should I be okay with killing Jews? If I was born in modern day North Korea, should I defend Kim Jong-Un and concentration camps? I mean, fuck man, it's just my culture! It would be wrong for me to look at it objectively!

What do you do when you're half Japanese and you have no idea how to fucking reconcile the fact that everything is wrong no matter what?

I want to learn Japanese, but if I do, I'm a weaboo trash. Or am I? I'm technically Japanese, but I don't look it, and I'd come across as some japanophile idiot pretending to be Japanese, the kind I don't like because there are so many things about Japan I hate, including the fact that I'd rarely ever use the language outside of communicating with my mother if and when she loses her ability to speak English...

is venus angelic a weaboo? please teach me franku senpai
the quality of your videos has skyrocketed lately
yo, I do rosetta stone for japanese. Does that make me a weeaboo?
I do not see a problem with collecting Japanese weapons, some people collect guns, some people collect stamps...stamps are little pieces of paper, whereas Japanese weapons are badass and make for a cool display.
Being obsessed with anime does not make you a weeaboo, I see weeaboos as idiots who think they know everything about Japan simply through anime and do not care to acknowledge Japan for anything else.
Those who take it upon themselves to actually learn the language, not just by picking up words from anime is commendable, learning a language is a great thing to do, should not matter what sparked your interest to do so, learning about a different culture is great.
Watching a shit ton of anime does not make you a weeaboo no more than watching a shit ton of American or British TV shows makes you a wannabe American or British person. Anime is extremely versatile unlike TV shows which use real people (No shitty green screen or CGI effects) And Western cartoons usually have an art style which is really basic, (Not Dreamworks or Disney of course, but they really only do movies).
Anime avatars, guilty! But it is no different than having an American or British TV character as your avatar :/

Lol, one time I mentioned my mum and I going to Japan to visit her college friends (one Japanese, the other American) who recently got married... and got accused of being a weeaboo. Yeah. Visiting a country so your parents can see friends totally makes me a weeaboo. Plus I, like, hate the majority of anime. But whatever... mention Japan once and you're a weeaboo. LOGIC!

This video made me cry like a dozen different times... Oh my God, my LUNGS.
AIR. WHAT IS AIR?!
I want to be your friend.
So I just watch anime in my spare time, cosplay occasionally so I can go to conventions with my friends and jack-off to Yaoi, does that make me a bad person?
its funny cuz 95% of your fan base are weeaboos
+Surgeon 117¬†I see
"We all have dreams..... I just wanted a piece of Percy's ass. Know what I'm sayin? "
One Piece > Naruto > Attack On Titan
Surprised you didn't mention furries at all. Wondering what ur opinion on that may be (probably similar)
My dad asked me why I watch the subtitled versions of anime. I told him "sometimes, the voice acting is better in Japanese. You kinda need to hear both, then decide" and he said "but then you ignore the animation itself"...He has.....a bit of a point, but...
The comment section is filled with people that¬†are making fun of peps that just like anime (not weeaboos). According to people in the comments: If your just a person that just watched or¬†still is watching¬†anime or has an anime dp (your a weeaboo)
In my opinion "that wont work" because 90% of the comment section probably grew up on Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z, collected yugioh cards. don't for get about the people that go to ComiCon, that go and dress up [for an event]
[Weeaboo: a person that wants to be Japanese through the anime they watch]
[an obsession over anime]
[an obsession over japan]
Both, two vary different things, but a thin line between them.
Oh I gat to get¬†some of that helicopters ass brb
Lol filthy you should become a voice actor
Why didn't you include avatar the last airbender in your anime list?
"Hey Boss"! This cracks up me up.
why does his voice change when he speaks different languages?
Cowboy Tanaka collects $50 ebay 19th century muskets
Excuse me, sir. I would like to say that while your jokes are hilarious, implying that a person cannot become Japanese is insanity. After studying Japanese on Duolingo and watching over 100 anime series to completion, I am Japanese. A filthy gaijin like you would not understand the transformation I have gone through.
Bronies scare me more than Weeaboos. *shudders.
Sumatran rock carvings are my favorite.
so funny :D it sounds like it hurts when you speak with that voice though xD
i bet joji has a small dick coz hes japanees lol
you're a strange china man.
This is so true, I see these weeaboos everywhere made my night X3
So you got two jews in your closet? and their both dead? o,o
Im seein some reeeeeeal cancers in these comments, and i aint talkin about the people woth the anime pics. Didnt you hear him in the comments, not everyone is a weeaboo, he is nit picking the actual over the border idiots who think anime and japan is some based god. I know like 99% of you are going to be really butthurt, but please dont nitpick at EVERYONE with an anime profile. Thats kinda not logical.
I liek Buckets
I'm probably wrong but... in the intro, does he say something like this?:
„Äå‰ø∫„ÅÆ„ÇØ„É≠„Çº„ÉÉ„Éà„Å™„Åã„Å´„É¶„ÉÄ„É§‰∫∫„Åå‰∫å‰∫∫Ë®Ä„ÅÜ„Çì„Å†„Äç
This guy scares me but I can't stop watching. He personifies Japanese comedy itself and it's scary haha.
weeaboo and general fan of eastern culture has become so blurred. I am a fan of eastern culture more than western, but not because they are strictly better as a weeaboo would say, it's just preference. An analogy would be all my friends eat vanilla ice cream but i like chocolate.
I'd just like to point out that the guy at 9:02 is a Homestuck fan, not a weeaboo.
Am i the only one to have noticed, that subtitles at the beginning are wrong.
He says : " There is 2 jews in my closet, there are both dead."
Cowboy Tanaka

Just a canadian who watched aot, it was pretty good. i mean I want to know what was in eren's basement but
my mom caught me watching anime one day, and so we had a long talk about what anime was (trust me...shes a little hard to talk to) and then we got on the topic of weeaboos. instead of trying to explain what those were to her i just showed her this video.¬†

needless to say im not allowed to watch anime anymore.
i watch anime and i think this video is a peace intellectual art.

I accept any price, the quality isn't important.

Please do a broney video. I would love to see what you do with it
Is it wrong that i watch anime read manga and wanna learn Japanese? :L

You call me names like westaboos, weaboo or even retarded and see if I care. Well I don't, because I know I'm not any of those categories.
does my profile pic count as anime? (only respond if you know what its from)
I had the game "The Forest" idling on its main menu in the background while I watched this. Perfect.Fucking.combination.
Damn that had me dying lols

Holy shit this is hilarious.
Well, he got the voice acts down.

I wonder how many of the Weeaboos shown on this video will even make it past their mom's basement, never mind to Japan.
Furanku-san, I became fluent in English just so I could play games and watch cool TV shows without subs, does that make me a weaboo?

lmfao this is hilarious im crying. who is this guy and why did it take so long for me to find him. on a side note i really hope he doesnt talk like that too much because that might really mess up his throat in the future haha.
`Fuck you Weeaboo Jones, I love Family Guy!` ahahahahha
Why is he talking so weird?
Please do one on bronies, I hate the gay autistic retarded fat greasy bad breath fags
Glad someone finally nailed this shit. Fucking faggots! Spend so much time watching shit-anime, can't even speak a fucking lick of Japanese.

Frank, bash some stupid ass Asian Westerners (mostly Asian American), who think that because they are Viet/Flip/Thai/Cambodian/Laotian/Korean/etc, they think they belong to, and identify with Japanese culture. Delusional fucks.
Damn it. I lost my best friend to the weeaboo culture. He is now such an annoying idiot, he thinks Goku can beat Superman.
But I didn't choose this avatar because I'm a weeaboo... or did I? Have I been a weeaboo all along!?!?
I'm a Weeaboo and I find this offensive
I thought u were saying Kantai Collection this whole time lol XD
Cory in the house is my favorite anime too

I have to confess I thought I was Japanese once someone kill me
You gotta admit that misty was not that bad xD
Does anyone know the name of the song that played around the time when Frank entered the Weeaboo Protection Chamber and during Weeaboo Jones' debut appearance?

Hey did you take a lot of your influence from the Gradual Report, nice video was just curious because you reminded me of him.
japanese people probably cringe when they see that shit. I appologize on behalf of the wapanese/weeaboos, my jap friends.
Do I class as a social degenerate if I like feudal Japan? I am a bit of a history nut.
at 9:19 is that from zelda e-e.................... cuz like it looks something like zora almost e-e

Yeah, i've been living in japan for the past two years. My japanese sucks, and when people ask me to speak it I don't. Reason: I don't want to sound like a faggot weeaboo.
hahahaha i only want to say that i love this shit, man. i love u b0ss
Your voice is grating, but this was funny.I honestly don't see what wrong with collecting japanese anime merchandise though :/ . I do because its fun and a hobby and I in no way want to become japanese anime is just a fun hobby of mine it doesn't make up my entire existence. I do know some weeaboos though who like randomly break out into butchered japanese, and wear cat ears like everyday (seriously thier at my college). Also I like my avatar :( but funny video man I enjoyed it
Dude weeaboo Jones looks like he has straight up down syndrome
Please let this not be the last we hear from Weeaboo Jones. He is the ideal villain.
Funny thing with me is, I love the Japanese culture, But i liked it since before i even knew what anime was. I watch anime now and then but the Japanese culture is what i really love. (I actually would like to go to Japan for their style of food and their cites) Now that i think of it, I love Taiwan, Korea, China, Japan, Thailand. I guess i just like the Asian culture in general. But i would love to take a 2 week trip or something to Japan or Korea.¬†
~~
Basically what i'm saying is, don't feel bad if you like anime, Asian culture, or maybe just want to take a trip to japan or somewhere. There is nothing wrong with that. What this guy is telling us, There is a such thing as going too far. Don't be afraid to show what you love, Just don't forget who you really are. I'm a teen who is 50% White and 50% Mexican. I will never forget that.

LOOOOOOL I just notice Mad Thad at 9:48. Rest In Prison LOOOOL
The filthy frank show is the best anime.
+AverageSpaghetti¬†Hey i can copy what rog said so I'm cool.
Thomas the train engine is my son.
4:49, repeat.
i love anime 2
Can somebody explain his voice?
Attack on titan sucks balls.
talk about bronies
Frank, if you REALLY want some heat on you, do a episode of "SuperWhoLock" fans.

I swear to god, you will the heat of the fucking sun on you because they're crazy as shit.
Anime is trash? I know, right?
Homestuck? Yeah, we know it's trash.
SuperWhoLock? They will and I quote "WILL MURDER U AND BURY THA BODY!1!1!!"

Seriously bruh, they're on a new level of stupidity.
Dis fuckin gui, dis FUCKIN GIE.
He is my goddamn inspiration to continue on.
I FUCKING LOVE THIS GUY.
"Anime is the reason why two nukes wasnt enough"- Someone with sense.
Watching this at 2 A.M. I'm pretty sure my parents think I'm watching porn
Nigga, I fuckin lost it at "where are the subtitles?"
Gomenasai, my name is Ken-Sama.

I¬Å'm a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)

I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.

I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%

When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!

I own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.

Wish me luck in Japan!
MAKE FUN OF ANIME
I lose my head at 1:56
Please start a brony rant.
hi frank i happened to notice your lips and thought they were nice

remember to drink plenty of hydration when drinking because then you dont get bad
Anime is for gayfags
weeaboos are satanic and Against jesus
Am I the only one that noticed that at 0:10 the subtitles are intentionally wrong, and he's actually saying, "There are two fat people in my closet. They're both dead." ?
i am an anime fan and this shit is the best thing on youtube for me
wat
Is that your real voice? And oh my lol i love Japanese culture but that doesn't make me a weeabo oh and what do you think about the my little pony people? I wanna hear your honest opinion :3
Rosetta Stone - LMAO @ That xD
Does he actually speak Japanese or was that just really good faking? lol
Please talk shit about bronies i want to see butthurt bronies XD
"Don't worry guys, me and pink guy gonna take carry of it, Pink guy do you remember the training??? QUICK TO THE WEEABOO PROTECTION CHAMBER" like.. *Fuck salamander-man and savana guy, i'll save pink guy, and then ChinChin will love me... finally.."
Anime.
I have to say almost every single anime character looks the fucking same. Seriously take all hair off of all characters and you have the same triangular like head, or a pentagon, with huge freakish eyes for no reason, and usually no nose. Like wtf. I can understand liking anime for the story or art style, but why does it all have to be the same, it is so fucking annoying. Plus tell me why they all kind of have the same voice, close your eyes and listen to anime and try to guess all of the voices, especially in japanese. Well that was my rant of the week. "FUCK HER RIGHT IN THE PUSSY!" -Abraham Einstein
remember pearl harbor
WHAT IS THIS
his mother is Japanese i think
Talkin shit about us weaboo's?? Dont make me go Weaboo No-Jutsu on your ass.
My favorite anime is sponge bob
People with long names referencing an anime are weeaboo faggots
Will you marry me filthy frank!?
Do a video on wiggers
dude omg yes weeaboo piss me off but i think that people who cosplay are not always weeaboos you could just be really into the show
When I was a boy, I wanted to be white. Thank god I am. I wouldn't have it any other way.
I like ur bamboo drwing pad
Frank is only 52?

Your videos are amazing. I cry laughing at every one.
hello people ! I watch anime a lot and like to talk ¬†about it with my friends (who watch anime too) , sometimes i use insults in japanese ¬†also i have a cosplay costume of c.c ( from code geass ) , after this video Im worried that i may be a¬†WEEABOO , please tell me if I am one or not
You forgot to mention that weeaboos hate cartoons and comics. I read a story saying some weeb ripped up a comIc book saying its not "sugoi".
WERE FUCKING FRANK



BASEDGODSCURSESWAG
GOD BLESS U PAPA FRANKUU! TIME TO FUCK WITH WEEABOOS!
this video is best franku
Yez bruda tell de whytez bout teh reel aziunz i luv riceeeeeeee.
The video was fine, it didn't anger me at all, but the comments did quite a bit. I'm a teenage white girl who likes cosplaying, has Kingdom Hearts posters everywhere, and watches anime. I have friends and I have pretty good grades. The fact that people claim that anime is a cancer, is like saying everything you love is a cancer (which is a pretty damn good metaphor). So basically, if you're a book collector, you'd totally look like a freak with all those books and how protective you are of them, which coincides with some weeaboos. Other weeaboos actually have a problem.
He's right you know
Talk shit about beliebers and directioners or how people call that shit k thx (and furries)
Bronies
bring much honor to Percy's ass
What realm does Papa Franku live in?
Why do you sound like you swallowed a chainsaw
Jesus Christ I really need to stop watching your videos at 2 in the morning because I laugh so fucking loud! XD
I love you
Lols, just stared at the comment section for 10 minutes reading the fights between the weaboos and the bronies over who is worse....honestly both are weird and both get you in a basement or attic so....
Bronies are FUCKING GAY
i have seen weeaboos, on my friends list on facebook....
Seinfeld was my favorite anime
+TVFilthyFrank¬† whats worse?? A Sonic Fag, a Furry, or a Weeaboo??
This is so beautiful
1:44 - 2:16 HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHA
Don't know how I feel about this one.

....Dr. Phil is best anime.......
God damn it. I was drinkin when he said "i just wanted a piece of percy's ass" now my screen is soaking and i cant breathe
hentai is my shit bro, what titles have you seen? or what do your recommend?

As an anime and manga fan, I have to say this.

This was a great fucking video.¬† Subscribed.

I wonder how many pounds of blubber are in the 269 dislikers?
i want this video tattooed all over my body, played on my gravestone and shoved up my ass
Does anyone else think this is funny as hell? XD
Good job! I have personally grown up and listened to arguments made almost daily about how much greater Inuyasha was than Kouga, Sasuke than Naruto, Ichigo than any character in bleach, Kurama than Yusuke, heck, even Kiba than Shikamaru.

What you didn't cover enough of¬†in this video however was the¬†women or¬†men who claim a character is theirs to the point. of .DEATH! XC

Has anyone here talked about your favorite character in an Anime/Manga/Light Novel to a friend, only to find said, "friend", is trying to tell you the character is theirs? News flash just in, stop the press people, the characters belong to the brilliant people who thought them into existence. Not to someone so in love with an animated character it actually ruins your conversations with them, day (in the case said friend harps at you all day), and friendship, and as you mentioned, dresses up in cosplay of the characters love interest. Or even worse themselves.

Also, your Japanese is great.
Ah yes, I remember going to an animethon and people there were way too fked up, but I was like maybe they are just asshats.....WEEABOOS WTF, idk if i can ever go there again, i'll probably get schooled in shit, ps leave my pegion's alone, just becasue of that i've made sure to type an extremely long comment and made an anime profile pic to show you.
ÏùºÎ≥∏ÏùÄ ÎÇòÏÅòÎã§
I might be also a weeaboo but gosh not that hardcore. I want to learn Japanese and I watch anime but I don't care if you make fun of it. I also want to use chopsticks to feel whats it like to be a Japanese person and buy a little merch but not tons of it. PLEASE TELL ME AM I TURNING INTO ONE
Damn... deleting Rosetta Stone... I thought it was pretty good...
b0ss
Damn when you use that deep voice, Franku...
I love animes. Like that famous anime...what was its name again, oh yeah, Harry Potter.
:D.D.D i am fucking dieing here. Best video.
yeh, you gotta learn how to USE a weapon. everybody can swing a sword, but can they REK someone with it?
What do you get when you cross a weeaboo with a bronie? jesus, because you need him.
Literally couldn't stop laughing.
Weeab00s.
Thank you Filthy Frank, for this god damn piece of art.
EBOLA-CHAN ^_^
I fucking hate anime
Legend of korra gud anime.
I didnt knew¬†Quentin Tarantino was a weeaboo
My old friend from high school has:
1.) Multiple katanas 
2.) Learned how to speak Japanese online
3.) Only watches anime in Japanese (no subtitles )
4.) Knew about AoT before it even came out
5.) Has a shit tone of manga
6.) Beats off to hentai
7.) Has his Facebook profile name typed in Japanese symbols/anime profile picture 
8.) And he isn't even Japanese 
I'm not kidding. I called him a WEEBOO, so now his parents won't let us chill anymore!    (-_-  )
Attack on Titan and Kill La Kill brought back the weeaboos.
What if it's American anime u know like RWBY
8:47 - Fat Basshunter.
who likes this stuff? Why the hell is youtube suggesting this to me?
264 people who disliked the video
Are weeaboos
Unsubbed, I'm sorry Frank but when you make fun of my precious Airplane Instruction Videos from the 80's anime series I get pissed.
I-I don't understand... what have Chinese cartoons gotta do with Japan?...
LOL! Frank you're the best! :)
LOL THIS GOT ME ENTERTAINED XD idk why but you started appearing cute to my eyes? HAHAHHAHAHAHA definitely subscribingüëç
Nigga my geometry teacher is a fucking weeaboo hahah
OH GOD DID I JUST SEE AN IMAGE OF CWC OF GOD WHY FRANK WHY.

Cory in the house isnt anime... Weabooo
Cory in the House! XD I can't stop laughing!
"you should notify your school"¬†
Implying any of these weaboos have the physical capabilities to kill anything with one of those swords before the Jocks beat the shit out of them.
I collect weapons... or I would if the U.S government would let me legally own flamethrowers

Guess I'll settle for propane torches
also your voice in the beginning is hot af
i learnt japanese from filthy frank am i a weaboo?
he's just a middle aged man, living a pathetic life. A sad old man, a man who knows nothing above anime message boards. It's caused by little self control, all that John knows is anime and all he wants is someone to help. Please will you help? Show him that you care? Your support can bring sunlight for people like John. You can help right now by calling 1-800-dis-dick and donate a dollar a day. A dollar a day can provide a weeaboo with a life, a life that goes beyond anime, skimpy school girl outfits, and¬†unnecessary samurai swords. You can bring hope, life, and love for these men. You can help by dialing 1-800-dis-dick or by simply visitng SaveTheWeeaboos.orgy and give a dollar a day starting now...
This is my favorite.
You say that We support equality and that Everybody gets shit, Do a Video about the BRONIES then.
WEEABOOS > BRONIES
I know people who are exactly like this, it's pretty sad.
No but for real.. don't talk shit about AOT or else imma find yo ass and kill u :>
I find this guy funny, it's just such a pity he has to put on that fucking voice the whole time it hurts my ears
electric anime batman doesn't count as anime avatar
I have never cum. I am 46 years old.
+TVFilthyFrank¬†2 questions 1. I dressed as a ninja for halloween, real katana and all, does this make me a weaboo? 2. I don't trust the subtitles for safari man... whats he really saying?? :/
God, those fucking weebs. Disgusting.
/cringe 8:50 - 10:25
tumblr wasn't lying about the comments section of youtube omg dying
What is the song at 6:45
i hate weeaboos. I don't conisder myself a weeaboo, I'm actually Japanese for real, well almost. I will be when I live in Japan though. Right now I'm studying japanese, japanese history and I'm following Bushido, the way of the warrior. This is why I hate weeaboos that know 5 words in japanese and use them all the time, kawaai baka DESU NE MOTHERFUCKER. I'm actually trying to become Japanese for real unlike all these faker wees. FUCK YOU WEEABOOS

So my question is, how good are my chances of becoming Japanese for real?
I thought Weaboos were mythological creatures that only exist in the deepest and darkest of basement realms
I like anime and Japanese culture but i prefer to be a Serbian redneck and legally drink (rakija) from the age of 16
Go team Serbia!!
The Filthy Frank Anthology Part 3: On Weeaboo Jones

Now unfortunately there isn't much to tell on Weeaboo Jones, ever since leaving his mothers dry as fuck pussy he's been a Weeaboo. At the age of 13 he was so cancer riddled with the disease that his father disowned him and he moved in with the rest of his local Weeaboos, which is to say the local homeless shelter. There he was trained in the ways of being the most absolutely disgusting piece of human waste that he became stronger than all of the other Weeaboos and consumed them and their knowledge of Rosetta Stone Japanese classes. This however did not prevent him from still getting everything messed up and he simply became an even larger faggot. How he came to travel across dimensions into the realm of Filthy Frank senpai is a different story. It all began when Weeaboo Jones was out for a stroll after devouring his third homeless person when he saw a flier for jobs in Japan, being the disgusting Weeaboo that he was he took the flier and proceeded to pack up all of his stained body pillows and dolls for his trip to what he claimed was his homeland. This trip however was secretly a plot by the US government to destroy Chin Chin with something they thought was equally powerful. Weeaboo Jones got onto his flight, but halfway through his laptop turned off in the middle of a Rosetta Stone session, he attempted to get a flight attendant as he screamed out in his ill pronounced Japanese to find out what was going on. Little did he know that no one else was ever on the plane, even the pilots were just robots from Japan. Everything needed to be Japanese on this plane in order for it to cross from the regular dimension into the dimension of Chin Chin which is also the dimension that Filthy Frank senpai lives in. As the multi dimensional portal passed through these two dimensions Weeaboo Jones became even stronger then he was before, he was able to shoot beams of energy out of his hands, much like his favorite anime Naruto. As the plane slipped into the other dimension it's engines blew up throwing Jones out of the airplane to what many would seem would be his death, but his extreme anime expertise helped him survive as he landed in a rice field and blacked out. Over the next several weeks he spent his time chasing Japanese girls around the country and being arrested by five different police stations, only to breakout killing everyone in the process. As the weeks went by he began to sense a sudden jump in hatred for his kind, he sought out the source only to find a run down apartment building in the ghettos of Tokyo. He blew up the door following his search for the source, determined to end it and assert Weeaboo dominance. It was at that point he found Filthy Frank and Pink Guy in the weeaboo protection chamber and was defeated by their filthiness. Now Weeaboo Jones power lives on through Filthy Frank and his apprentice pink guy, finally allowing him to get a piece of Percy's ass.
dear filthy frank...you are the number one cure for all of the retarded shit on YT!
I feel like showing some of this to people who judge me instantly and call me "weeaboo."
One of the suggested videos is "In defense of weeaboos" with a bunch of japanese shit I can't read.
this is so fun XD
One thing about anime.
I'm ready for the heavy breathing and fast typing.
wtfs with all this pussy shit anime best anime is obv sesame street that shits tight
this guy is a faggot
The fact that he is speaking fluent Japanese says something.

I don't know what, but something.
Favorited, subbed, and appluaded.
ugu
am i a weeaboo if i learn japanese from your videos
I swear those images are in every single cringe thread.
Fuckin' bronies
I just fu**ing Died
Where the fuck does Frank shoot all this shit? Seems like he has access to a bunch of cool shit.
My favorite animes are Avatar the last airbender and jimmy neutron
do a video on the brony community plz
Your weeaboo impression is rather disturbing.
...
I like you, good sir.
Best anime ever = Cory in the house!
"KONWICHI WA YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARDS!" I'M CHOKING IM FUCKING CHOKING.
The japanese should make more games for People outside JApan ... dont wanna get a WeeBOO but i like to play dat shit
It's funny because when he says "Are you ready to have some fun?" He's actually saying "There are two foreign people (i think) in my closet".
The first time I have ever watch TVFilthyFrank and I'm so fucking confused.
Filthy Frank you are my waifu.....5evr.
What's a bronie
Heavy breathing F.R.I.E.N.D.S IS SUCH A BETTER ANIME THE SEINFIELD
thank you for covering important news
This video made me shit myself laughing. thumbs up.
3:07 Same with Minecraft.
Things you should like Japan for
- Rich history and culture
- Food which is somehow healthy and nice at the same time
- Authours, Musicians, Artists etc.
- Importance in the global economy¬†

Things you shouldn't like Japan for
- A nerdy subculture ostracized the world over for being obnoxious and flat out stupid

You like anime, we get it, that's fine. But please shut the fuck up.
Imagine pulling an all nighter in that study room in the back corner and filthy frank comes in to film a video and doesnt know you're there...
Many of the subtitles that he posts are bullshit and I find it hilarious because I'm Japanese. In the beginning, he says that he has two dead jews in his closet, there's a part where the safari guy says he loved pussy
COWBOY TANAKA
That anime voice acting impression was fantastic.
My friend is suck a weeaboo its annoying
I fucking died.
9:44 I'd hit that. What can I say, braces turn me on.
King of The Hill is best anime
I can't imagine how fucking concerned his neighbors are
I used to hate bronies, even the shittiest parts of the fanbase don't even fucking compare to japanophiles/animetards. (Yes, I've had personal experiences of those festering weeaboo manchildren)
i showed my mom this video and now she's inspired
Frank! Make one about bronies PLEASE.
Can you do a rant about bronies? Or are they similar to weeaboos?
lol if you're a hot weeabo you're automatically forgiven
makE fun oF BRONIES
am i the only one who eats sushi with a spoon?
Nigga ain't got no shit bout animu an shit.
I love you papa franku
9:53 oh my fucking god
I wonder how many times the cops have had to talk to Frank about his "noise level".
My bro ALWAYS watches you. I watch anime because I get bored and I like the concept of it. My bro calls me a weeaboo shit 'cause of you. I actually completely agree with you, Frank, but my brother is so freaken stupid. o-o You made me laugh though.
This is drugs...can I have some mo?
Yo franku I see that fucking bamboo tablet you kawaii anime drawing weeaboo.
U sohai haha. Sohai why is Maki involved with this. ‰∏ÄÁï™„Éì„Éá„Ç™„ÄÇ„Åù„ÅÆÊõ≤„ÅØÈù¢ÁôΩ„ÅÑ„Çà„ÄÇ All the editing skills (yL
But can you translate this video into Japanese then put English subtitles on it?
I so want to remake the show perfect stranger with me and frank. in it we break into¬† Bronson Pinchots house and beat him with a bag of potatoes and sing¬† the humpty dance song
This is fucking gold!
Oh my god.. Bruh. Dat me~
Frank, i hope you know people who can get rid of all the people who have videos defending weeaboos, then everyone will realize how useless weeaboos are, and nothing will stop us from eradicating them
jesus fucking christ m8! kill all people wit anime characters/pony profile pictures plzzz
You're a weeaboo for making this lol
why do people feel the need to segregate anime from just general video discussion? ¬†"I'm not watching cartoons, i'm watching anime." ¬†It's the same shit, different toilet.
i died at 4:10
Well... That was fucking TRUE !! All Hail Filthy Frank !!
rakis
I am afraid my brother is evolving into this ,my first sign was when he prefers sub anime even when the dub was good,
Anime suck's like seriously if you watch that crap your a fag.... all it is is a bunch of Japanese people moaning. +TVFilthyFrank¬†is right haha!!! I can already see the weeaboo's breathing hard and typing in cap's. lmfao.
I don't like those chinese cartoons.
"Weaboos go to japan and be like "where the subtitles!?!?" Lmao I am done
Frank chuckling during that Thomas the Tank Engine joke was amazing.
I collect Arisakas? That's a Japanese weapon.

3... 2... 1...
IT HAS BEEN SPOKEN
AMEN
PRAISE THE LORD
0:09 real subs:
"There are two foreigners in my closet."
"Both whom are dead".
This epidemic of fanbases being represented by the worst of their kind is quite an issue. Otakus, Bronies, and Furries all have the pretentious, incredibly insecure teenagers/man-children owning their brand and effectively are most people's gateway into what the fanbase is about. This, I think, comes from the fact that the Weaboos of all the fanbases are far more easier to find in casual, unspecific, and especially irrelevant searches, forums, pages, etc. than just the normal fans. The normal fans are too quiet and don't often openly disown the assholes that give their fanbase a bad name. Also, both sides most often live by the "I don't care what anyone thinks" code of arms which leads to complete oblivion to how you are presenting yourself and your credibility as one who stakes a claim to what their interests are. Especially with Weaboos, who are so far deep into that mindset that they have thrown out the idea of considering the direct and peripheral consequences of their asinine, childish actions.
Pls do one about bronies, you neeed to blow up their fanbase
Where does he get these ideas are beyond me
I'm a fan of main stream animes (like Sword Arts Online, Dragonball Z, Naruto, etc.), and as soon as I mention one of these on an online chat/post/thread, I get my ass stomped out on how they are shit and I should watch animes I never even heard of. So I see where this vid is coming from.

Like what you wanna like but holy god don't try to deep throat me with stuff i'm not interested in seeing or never even heard of. Weeaboos are a scary thing.
I gave this to my Japanese teacher. He's going to show this to the entire class. Thank you based Franku.
People with anime pics huh?...
That was pretty r00d, papa franku.
Its like I'm part Norwegian, and you don't see me walking around with a Viking helmet on praying to the Norse Gide Thor and Odin carrying an axe and yelling SKOAL! Sure I chew SKOAL and occasionally root for the Minnesota Vikings but that's as ethnic as I'll get. I'm also Irish and drink a lot and root for Norte dame but that has nothing to do with heritage
When you've recovered from this ordeal...

Bronies.
Is that an Osu! tablet in the back?
I dunno, even if you aren't trying to call yourself Japanese.. if the first word I associate with you when your name pops up in my head is "anime" and if I have to describe you to other acquaintances as "that anime guy", you're still a fucking weeb
I was walking down the street and i saw a raving midget, it was like looking at a black kid trying to like Starbucks. I shoved a toothpick up my dick hole and now its bleeding. My doctors say that i am mentally disabled but i think they are the ones who are mentally disabled. Sometimes i wonder what the world will be like without me? Will it be normal? My balls went inside me when i came.
plz help me my love
Frank i have chin chin in my room O_O
Frank plz give me love <3
I've never seen this guy's videos, but I really hope all that he said was for comedic purposes. (Cause it was really funny) But, I seriously hope he didn't mean any of these things cause it's just full of irony.
3:52 ''This is my swamp''
There are also these people who hate their own culture and pretend to be French. They're called "ouiaboos"
i masturbate to ninja turtles... does that count?
I'm just wondering is Frank just a white person living in Japan or is he Japanese?
Fucking Weaboos
