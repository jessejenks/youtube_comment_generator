This man deserves 17 rice balls up his booty hole, cuz he more garbage than my left esophagus, WOOORDD!!!
with those glasses on he looks like     johnny depp
That's not how you open a fucking can
I feel like the shitty ass apartment adds to the aesthetic but at the same time I'm feeling really bad he has to live in that
reminds me of Tyler, The Creator this shit
this guy can spit fire
hell yah

the beat of the song is cool but the lyrics are super messed up

Fucking Ricegum should take notes with this guy
Pink guy should be a legit artist. Like his songs should be on Spotify or some shit
The people who disliked this art are just angry white christian moms
11 million

Im not into trap or rap but man why is Frank's music so motherfucking good
he's actually really gd at music rapping and singing üòÇ
You could've been a real musician with all the types of music you make and ur name could be filthy rich in not hating I'm just saying that could be your alternative for if your channel dies out

Bass dropped harder than my views
Those onigiris look damn good
That poor bath tub
I really like this song and this channel
why does his face and voice seem so much more mature, compare his face in this vid to any other and you'll see and compare his singing voice in this and any other song he's made
kotori remix is awesome
Pink guy..you bring light to what seems like everlasting darkness. Thanks dude.
Does Papa Franku actually smoke?
Filthy needs to roast ricegum
2:33 Fucking skills. it even landed on the wrong side and he had no reaction.
better than most shitty rappers
No! You deserve better amount of subs, frank! You should be on the top
the beat is sick
Were those real or fake cigarettes? They looked pretty good

You are awesome Filthy Frank!
One of my closest hoes asked me if I were to go for anyone who would it be, I said papa franku which is prolly why I wasn't able to smash
Keep it filthy muthafucka

This guy eats a bowl of meth for breakfast every morning.
This is real music, slim Shady what you gotta say?

I wish more people from my generation could appreciate this type of music.

Francis of the filth you cheer me up when things are down. I listened to this and cried when my crush legit denied me. He banished my heart to the rice fields. now I'm just a henchman for chin chin.
"...a culinary....funny video..."

You are probably the only person on the PLANET who is just like me..
I've watched this 23 times today

Filthy furanku watashi wa g≈´guru hon'yaku de kore o hon'yaku shimashita
Love the beat

I wonder how hard it is to clean up the messes he make after each video
I am sure that he is the founder of how to basic
Did I just hear "is that too rude" on the filthy frank show
Could  someone make an instrumental version? I want to do a cover but all the instrumentals are just loops of the bass track
I love how the advertisement I got for this video was "Be the generation that ends smoking" as he's smoking through the entire video.
Lobby
0:00> 0:10 same sound in outlast whistleblower :)))))
he looks like john lennon in a undercover pinksuit who trying to make atheism
what if he collaborated with tyler, the creator

Your kitchen looks nice.

Hanayo
My Japanese high school teacher wasn't very impressed and looked at my friends and me with quite a shocked impression after one of my friends said "Hey miss, Ore wa ochinchin ga daisuki nandayo" none of us had any idea of the real meaning or what it translated to in English all we knew is that Chin Chin the almighty lycra god said it quite a bit... Well, let me tell you that's the last time we say anything in Japanese that filthy frank says! 

- Great videos, keep it up Frank!
TBH I jus learned how to make rice balls

Pink Guy has taken my bathroom hostage.

Honestly favourite Pink Guy track
Pink Guy can make music out of anything from Weeaboos to Uber Pussy to the AMC "Lets go to the Lobby" shit so I'm making a song called "White Toothpaste is my Cum"
Can't this guy afford a better place? üò≠üò≠
Frankypooh, i want to have your babies. #nohomo

Frank is better than all the modern rappers ive heard

Mini golf champion, you got no drive playa.
Welcome to the terror dome;¬†the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these
This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog, I can smack E.T
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

[Hook]
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 2]
I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday"This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role model
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday
I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)
Fucking awesome filthy, I got mixed up with Fried noodles and rice  balls, but these songs are awesome, please make more

Thanks dude.

Dude I love your "I don't give a fuck" style.

Pink Jesus.
Best pink guy song ever heard so far. I listened to the pink guy album and pink season.
La- LaLa Be-Be
To be honest. I have a friend who acts like pink guy. Got me to wonder if he is going to be some 2nd Pink guy. But I don't think so...
hjo

üçö balls üçö gum

This shit is actually dope
Yooooooooooo Japanese guy you can have my bitches

Thinking of pink guy as a hip hop artist instead of a monster is weird lol
„Åä„Å´„Åé„Çäüçô

This sounds like something tyler the creator would make
so pink
......Wew. He smokes.
daddy
i wonder how many christians reported this video... not joking yo
Him and how to basic need to meet
I live in a constant state of fear and misery
I love pink guy.
I can't wait for someone to make a channel like this called "filthy female" or something where it's girl versions of each of them
I JUST KNOW IT'LL HAPPEN
Ich liebe Schmutziger Frank. <3
1:10
Ping ping ping ping
i wish he made his real music, because its actually very good.
filthy frank ft. rich chigga plssss
i used this video as a cooking tutorial...
All the gay kids listening to Macklemore when there are real rappers that aren't gay like Eminem and pink guy is pretty damn good if I do say so my self!
is this sampled from how you like me now - Hopsin ft. SwizZz
Pink Omega so hawt
I want to eat that shit and then suck Frank's dick. Or the other way around, IDC.
can we just acknowledge the fucking amazing beat, amazing ass beat machine, his macbook and keyboard and just the fucking fact he's amazing than most artists on the radio .. FUUUCK
you're howtobasic
Nice Beat Bro
is it me or is Jim Norton saying at the end "that's not funny "?
Sick beat.
Is he singing about jelly donuts?
I'd listen to this to fall asleep tbh like it isn't bad at all

I'm just tryna strangle these fuckers
I'm just tryna scramble these fuckers
Pink Guy needs to publish a cookbook.
Let's all go to the lobby
That bass though, holy shit
I think I just turned gay o.o
That's some nice monologue in the end. As a fan of frankjavcee and PC music, i really appreciate when people accept there are no rules as to what's "real" or not. I just hit it or not, and i think that's really how everyone could fully appreciate art or whatever it is - this is the ultimate no prejudice, no need for categorisation or putting it in a genre box
I love jogi üòÇ
he makes some dope mixes actually
When is the Filth gonna clean his place?
I need a man that can do both




cook and rap simultaneously
When you actually learn how to cook stuff
I want to donate to get him out of that shit hole. He deserves better
Frank can have ten million views a vid and still be considered a Niche.
Pls, what's the name this cloth..

This ones for them folks who be dead inside, 
Mini golf champion you got no drive playa,
Fuck boys treat my dick like a trampoline, 
I only work with paper like a fax machine,

Whippin through the flannel, 
Burn out ash on my chest with the camels, 
I'm here to be an act not a role model,
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle,

Ereyday,

the things that Frank does just blurs the line between artistic and autistic
He made this beat when he was 15.
Harambe deserved to die. :)
These donuts are great! Jelly-filled are my favorite! Nothing beats a jelly-filled donut.
His face when he says "big cock" with the cigarette gets me every time.
watch out Dad, i`ve found him, Vincent Cyr he will find you, and he will kill you. Meet me in the Rice Fields at 3:47 am in the dream realm and i shall protect you.

This track has glimpses of Chloe Burbank. It makes me tear a bit.
Who is the singer?

I thought pink guy couldn't cook
I'm concerned that he might actually live there.
Who else hears the sexy bari sax in the background
I love it so much.
This beat is TooDamnFilthy
He landed the cigarette in his mouth backwards
is it me or this beat is made out of a happy wheels sound effect???
this beat is my favourite beat bw
I get that the songs are for comedy purposes but they sound legit as fuck, Pappa Frank you are the man
this is my shit,
brendonyoulden
This beat is so fuckin' heavy
best Jojivlog yet, gotta say.
REAL MUSIC YAY
Frank's real voice and rapping personality (probably closer to his real one) is better than his filthy raspy one.
What the fuck he made the beat when he was 16
this reminds me of earl sweatshirt. something about the beat
Hey, that's pretty good.
This song is so good in my opinion that I put this on my anime playlist lol üòÇüòîüòÖ
ALL HAIL LORD FRANK
did i just learned how to cook onigiris?
How is his singing different from him speaking?
Best tutorial of rice balls EVER
-He can cook
-He is funny
-He sings
-He is strange

I want to marry him ;w;
y'all who are saying this shit is "actually good" are throwing disrespect at papa franku. like no shit its good. dont look at it as comedy look at it as a fucking sick track.
buy pink season on iTunes
this man gives 0/10 fucks
You should do a song with lil dicky.
Tbh Frank's a good rapper and surprisingly enough a good cooker too
loby
reminds me of odd future
okay the lyrics are obviously for comedic effect but that beat is fucking insane
the piano part should be beat on it's own 
so
ÔΩÖÔΩçÔΩèÔΩîÔΩâÔΩèÔΩéÔΩÅÔΩå
these anti smoking ads are getting out of hand
He looks like John Lennon.........
Now this is music.
I write raps
filth wanna join channels.... im pretty crazy...Hahaha... trust me... you is what I do daily without trying
This was not only a great song, but was also a fucking lit cooking tutorial.
Love the beat at 1:12
i would eat anything filthy frank has ever made. (including hair cake)
coming back to this cuz he said he produced this when he was 16
straight fire
Damn this song is fucking good
Hes unreasonably attractive
so fucking bad lol
This is lowkey hikey lit
It's actually a rice ball recipe.
oh shit i've never rinsed rice!!!
he made this beat when he was just 16
He apparently wrote this when 16, that's pretty good huh
The reactions you get playing this in a car with the windows rolled down are priceless. I suggest everyone try it
–û–•–£–ï–ù–ù–û
he made this beat when he was 16??
still fine though.... zipper head or not. He's way too hot for his own damn good.
Humor aside, his music is incredible. I love it. I can't stop listening it it.
Something has to be wrong with me. I find this weird and hilarious asshole strangely attractive. Even/especially his ridiculous faces and noises. I would rape him sooo hard in the face.
He produced this beat in one day when he was 16
We need to smoke together. The same one. On both sides. You eat my smoke ash's
I don't like rap but this is good.
if he made serious music it would be so good
you and rich chigga should collab
bro his house is so fucking dirty worse roommate everrrrrrrrr
I don't need a microwave.
Tyler the creator collab
Is no one going to acknowledge who much of a musical genius he is
did he say he needed a microwave? I can't tell.
Killer frank
Can their please be a lyric video
Is the voice franks actual voice
At 1:27 you look at the bottom you see that he tried to do a waterbottle/beer flip challenge but failed
I was thinking I can't decide whether I like the gritty rap or the soulful music more.. but then I remembered I don't have to choose, found a guy that can do both. Your music helps me relax, both kinds. Thank you, dude.
Can you do a video where you teach us about the equipment you use and where you get samples from
the beat is so goooooooooooood 





lyrics ate shit tho
Can i have an instrumental version for an edit?
10 out of 10 true japnese
can i just say that onigiri is freaking delicious
I have the same glasses
xur I owe me I paid u enough for three of coins and i didn't get is it u hentai squid face fuck lol
Omg, Frank you are starting to show symptoms of INTERNET RAPPING!!!!!!!!!!
is that a microkorg XL?
Every time pink guy cooks, he has to make good songs as well.
You should collaborate with childish gambino... you'd make amazing music tbh
how the fuck those he have such a good voice üò≤
Sou o √∫nico BR que escuta isso todo dia ??
Thanks for the recipe, stuffed my rice balls with diarrhea
hahaha
If you get your albums onto actual CDs or even vinyl, I'd invest.
I actually use your songs as food tutorials
So fucking happy its on iTunes now
I wonder how funny this would be without any music??? Plz make a second one like that it would be hilarious
This was over a year ago.... felt like it came out a month ago. what?
fukin pink teletubbie ...bro i always hated that fuker
[Intro]
Let's all go to the lobby
Let's all go to the lobby
Let's all go to the lobby
To get ourselves a---

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the terror dome;¬†the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these
This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog, I can smack E.T
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

[Hook]
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 2]
I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday"This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role model
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday
I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)
Filthy frank, I think I love you. ‚ò∫üòÇüòçü§ûüèª

Killer whales, Humpbacks , and these Narwhals.

I'm just tryin' to strangle these puckers,
I'm just tryin' to strangle these fuckers,
I'm just tryin' to strangle these,

This the Bleep Blop,
You make the beat flop,
Breathin' more kush than the seat got
so we got the beat drop and
harder than your son's balls at 12 not
to mention that we harder than Viagra with the big cock.

I'll fuck you in the mouth again,
I'll let you know that I'm a schitzo so I be hearin' shit, 
so don't be fuckin' me cause bet your ass I'm hearin' it, 
when I get done with you I'll make sure that you celibate.
(Eewwww)

Fuck your dog I can smack E.T.,
and I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe, huh.

(What is that too real?)

I'm a fuckin' nuisance with different types of abuses,
I'm runnin' up in the premises, helpin' you tie your nooses,
Cause all of you fucks are clueless and do not know how to do this,
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses like oh.
Like oh.
Oh.
Oh.

I fuck around for money like a cam whore,
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some GAY SHIT.
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
beat their fucking teeth in cause they raise shit.
You sound like.

I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday.

This one's for the folks that be dead inside,
Mini-Golf champion, you got no drive playa'.
Fuck boys treat my dick like a trampoline,
I only work with paper like a fax machine, uh.
 
I'm on the cars hood screamin' like a mammal
rippin' through the Flannel burn my ass on my chest plated camels.

I'm here to be an act, not a role-model,

x1.25 way better
one of the best song intros you have ever made dude.. I liked how you made it like you were just tuning the beat and then that first line with the greetings and after that the high pitched rhyme "shit" "in it" all that worked to make a really good intro man I hope we see that again somewhere. I know this is an old video but I keep coming back here just for that intro
the bass is too strong
This song expands my mind.
Laik
Papi tu no sabe lo q dise... ya yo tengo mucha cicatrise
hahaha when he reaches down in dramatic slow-motion and ashes his cigarette in the rice as it's cooking, I almost pissed myself laughing. Like "how can this get any filthier.. ahh okay there we go" xD
I'd eat his rice üòè
i finally got the wading Japanese joke
Pussy boss
lol do he clean?
Can anyone help with what those piano chords are in the bridge?
Somebody watching at 3-January-1,000,000?
i'm hungry‚Ä¶

The bass is so great, that if I put a bass boost on it just distorts.
How come you have so many subs but live in a tiny flat?

Not gonna lie. The fucking bass in this is insane.
he actually talked like a normal person at the end
I like how at one point he thought "Okay, time to film myself sitting in a chair eating a rice ball and holding a cigarette.
i find it impressive that he uses gargeband for alot of his songs. He really knows how to use it.

you should release your instrumentals into your main channel.
I wonder if he ever got that girl to be celibate?
I guess his rap genre falls in the same category as lil dicky since his intention is for a comical rap style

i fucking love rice
L i t  a f
that beat goes deep
that beat drop at the start is better than any drops you can hear on radio, it's insanely good
If he would put this on spotify and tried to make like more serious music Id actually put it on a playlist. Flow and voice are really cool
fucking jews
i love all the songs you make there so hard to stop listening to  you're really great at making these songs and all the rest of the content on your channel is amazing
This is actually better than most modern music.
I WAS BORN IN THE RIGHT GENERATION IF THIS SHIT IS WHAT MY GENERATION LISTENS TO.
Oh man the last part was an entire dis to his own community and so true.
let's all go to the lobby yo get ourselves a treat.
I creamed
I thought pink guy couldn't cook.

I love all your music, whoever said i want real music is not a real fan
I always wanted to ask is that his house if so it's a bit of a mess
I'm so offended that he's Japanese and cooked rice on the stove.... Real rice goes in the rice cooker obviously
some ofwgkta type shit, hell yea.
Oh I see how you make authentic rice balls now. You have to use the rice itself as an ashtray. Thanks Frank.
I bet everytime you come up with an idea for a vid you are either drunk or high...love it
i love how meticulous he is with his rice balls
This entire channel was just A WAY TO PROMOTE HIS FILTHY RAP MIXTAPE
do you guys like fried noodles or rice balls more? i'm curious.
Watching this high changed my whole perspective on rap and music in general thanks frank.
"At it again for the OG's.

I made this beat a while back but I had to spice it up and make it into a track (prod. me)"

if you're too lazy to read the fucking description.
Hey, Thats pretty good! ~i dubbzTv
Narwhals
Thankyou franku, your amazing music has inspired me to become a chef, I cooked rice balls for the local farmers in the rising sun until i got fired, I now feel like life is worth something more than merely telling people to "turn it of and on again" in my local call centre, you gave my life meaning.
probably his best song
The shit get's awesome at 1:11
my balls itch
I got skullcandy earbuds so I got ALL the bass without lowering the audio it hurts a bit but yet I love it XD
He's actually a dope rapper,reminds me of Tyler the Creator
lit
This guy makes smoking look cool
GOYA? wtf no me esperaba esa XD
2.30 that was fucking sick
cool music studio...comes with a toilet too.
suck my balls
The bass when the beat drops at the beginning...
what's the beat man
nigga you trash
FUCK MANüî•üî•üî•
Gotta admit this is fire.
what the fuck the outside of your window looks so fucking depressing
the chorus' are the only reason i live
wait , he can speak english?
Remember when misha said he would overtake franku? life less pile of shit with no talent misha is.
thank you mrcam
dope shit but you didn't clean the rice properly
i like it
this song is so fucking
fuck this
2:35
I want to clean his house
this is how pink guy hears himself in his mind he is an awesome rapper
This song is epic, I wish more people from my generation appreciated this music. Fuck this, Let me get my pink guy album travel out of this stupid generation shit.

PUT THIS SON GON PINK SEASON PUT RICEBALLS ON PINK SEASON
the pink guy ad tho
Is that franks real voice?
his voice sounds like someone familiar
I just got, like, a Japanese add of Frank in the STFU vid doing his shit while anime shit music was playing in the background.
This was the first ff video I ever saw.
This has such an Odd Future vibe to it üíï
we want real music
My god, It's Asian Rick.
You're the white earl sweatshirt
the advertisement I got for this was a repost of a pink guy music video that someone stole and used as their own.
let's all go to the lobby
Best
Everyone i showed this to didn't get the "whaling like the Japanese" bit. They are morons, you are a god.
Necesito que alguien traduzca este video D:
this should be in a museum
When I clicked this, there was an ad for Pink Guy's "I Just Want To Dance" thing.
Pink cunt clean your feet faggot
Can someone get me all the lyrics pls.
when pinkguy has on those glasses his voice changes when he doesnt have he is normal its like someone took over his body (yes im aware thats franks real voices)
That moment when Frank makes better music than you.
I'm not really into modern-day rap but I can't stop listening to Frank's stuff, perhaps it's because this is actually high quality rap.
Do you need a microwave?
quem √© eminem perto desse deus do rap
ey b0ss. u killin it mane!!!
Lobby!
When the bass dropped in the beginning it almost blew up my headphones
Thumbs up O^O
Lit af
lit fams
Dude all his songs have millions upon millions of views if he put this shit on iTunes he's ba making hella bank not that he already isn't but holy shit I'd buy an album lol
Still my favourite Pink Guy rap
[Intro]
Let's all go to the lobby
Let's all go to the lobby
Let's all go to the lobby
To get ourselves a---

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these
This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

[Hook]
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh
Smoking kills
i tastes like shit idk

I am just going through his previous videos and the beat for Rice Balls was also used in Human Ramen. lol. I'm really curious exactly what and how much more he has in store for us lol. ...and also, "hhhwelcome"?

In school I was listening to this with headphones. They unplugged in rme on the exact line I will fuck you with a radiator pipe
Tyler the creator and frank need to fucking do a song together
You mispronounced "echelon" -2/10 .

Every single video: "this one is for the OGs" Ok buddy, then where is your actual content?
imagine papa franku and tyler the creator making a track
What glasses is he wearing in the bath tub? I need them.
Wait I thought he was Australian... why doesn't he have an Australian accent?
Here's a producer better than Kanye and Jcole
He just roasted his own fandom I love it. This man is a god.

You know I wonder how many vids of Franks got demonetized
So underrated
Better than any shit Ricegum has "created".
that beat dropped harder than my poop
Not gonna lie when I first heard this song I thought it was "raw beat"
It made my day when he changed that song into his own thing XD
Fire like Kobe in 1945.
Sounds like an Odd Future beat
1:19-1:34
That's what life is all about. You've got it figured out, man.
I DONT NEED A MICROWAVE!
pink omega, what do you use to make music?
Aye Lmao
It's sad that I have to come here to hear this going along my song on play list ;(
I've not seen anyone mention the fact that Frank has one half of a chair in his kitchen.
Why the fuck does he have only one half of a chair in his kitchen?
Awesome song and a useful recipe
Why the fuck is this in 60 frames per second

Aren't you supposed to use some rice vinegar to make rice balls so that it sticks together like traditional sushi rice
This shit is to fire üî•
Tyler the creator vibe anyone?
Don Hertzfeldt anyone?
I genuinely like this song. Not as a meme or prank song, but as an actual song.
Yo frank, you probs don't give a shit and I'll get blasted for caring

But are you ok man? Mentally and Physically?
Ahh, onigiri tastes so good.
I love this song¬†too much, i'm not okay

Where the fuck is that Grammy

poucos Br's conhecem o papa franku :(

why are you talented musically xDDD

Went and made rice balls after this
This reminds me a lot of tyler
Anyone know what audio equipment he uses?

Lyrical fucking Guinness.
petition for pink guy to go on tour
ITZ PINK SEASON BOI, DAMN LIT AF
I've never seen such an openly chinky chink

adult swim won't take frank because he's too crude
THIS WAS TOO LIT.
I learnt how to make rice balls today.
How the fuck does this asshole make decent music like I mean come on really?
learned how ti make rice balls because if this video hahaha. love your music frank
dope
pink guy needs to collab with rich chigga
It takes a genius to act like an idiot.
A-mei-zing song
I want him to be my dad
Why is his channel not a show on adult swim yet?
dude no joke I like pink guys musical talents
Better then Eminem
God, he's so talented. It's a shame that his fans force him into the persona 24/7, because the Chloe Burbank album was fantastic and he doesn't really have so much to work with as Frank, but he's just amazing, even with these Pink Guy songs.
Fuqbois treat my dick like a trampoline,does that mean he's gay ?
someone please do a version where he says im just trynna strangle these... and then keemstars face appears and yells niggers.
Jelly filled donuts*
is this an song on google music and the appstore?
This is my SHIT !!!
the bass makes my behringer headphones vibrate furiously
that ass at 1:24  :333333
Whoa... I didn't expect this.
this shit is the best,fuck all the "real" rappers
damn the bass
this beat is sick
Is this him rapping the whole way through
what software to make the song
Pink Season
how can one man posses so much talent like cmoon brah
this is so good
That piana beat at 1:12 is so damn smooth. I love chill-hop beats like that.
seriously questioning if he actually lives in that shit hole or they make it look like that for videos either way its pretty dope.
Pink guy can rarely ever articulate thoughts effectively to the layman, however there are exceptions to this ever relevant rule.
Particularly when spitting them sick bars mang.
Good music like this used to be on the radio, but now we just have Justin Beiber and Miley Cyrus? I was born in the wrong generation.
top
I think I'm I'm love
Its just him cooking with rap if you will in the background
The John Coltrane of this generation.
https://vk.com/search?c[q]=Pink%20Guy&c[section]=audio&c[performer]=1

jojivlogs()b/mp4.sjct#hwh###hsijd/Trojan/&@piavu694?&√ó"
So. I've noticed how many of these Music videos (all of them almost) involve cooking. So I think this is a continuation of conveying co-ordinates to Frank via smell
That 60fps though
1.25 Speed is way better!
It actually sounds alright :D

Well. Still better than KSI's songs together no offense xD

Anyone else have a Tyler feel to this song? Especially around 1:11

Something that makes me love this guy is that he doesn't use any ad in his videos, instead those shit channels
Why act stupid instead of rapping dang man ur so good
are u a japanese?
x1.5 Is Amazing.
i was mumbling this in my skype group call and they removed me thinking i was chanting a devil curse. smh
Pink Guy is so edgy, he puts cigarette ashes in his food masterpieces üëå
FUCK ME
don't you mean jelly filled donuts
he's so talented like does he know he could probably go into any profession he wants
Is it weird that I legitimately learned how to make rice balls from this?
balls.....
my favorite
I actually learned how to make rice balls, thanks pink guy
when i was a pussy nigga i thought howtobasic had the hardest cleaning job
Onigiri? More like... OSHIRI! Because I EAT THE WHOLE ASS!
I love you filthy frank! Date me!
And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.
This used to be humour. Now its humbling
I thought pink guy cant cook
Is this on iTunes?
isn't onigiri Zoros move from one piece?
he's actually pretty good at raping
he's got a tyler the creator type flow its cool and different
I can't play fucking tf2 anymore it's ass
As soon as he starts rapping I realize hey could be a professional rapper
what a spiritual miracle lyrical
This should be on spotify
I really hate niggers
Man his songs are actually really good.
beutiful
Play this at my funeral
I listen to this as music like Un-ironically, I think I need helpüòÖ
Play on 1.25x speed. Its amazing
wow papa franku's voice is so... soothing
If anyone's wondering, I'm pretty sure the piano chords are:
F# minor/ A‚ô≠ minor/ F# minor/ A‚ô≠ minor/ B minor/ A‚ô≠ minor/ B minor/ A‚ô≠ minor
The bass gives me orgasms
I used this as a tutorial on how to make rice balls
this is fire
Beat reminds me of Jamba
I loved the BMO sample lmao
He doesn't need a microwave
nice
Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these


This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)
[Interlude]
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh



I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday" This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role model
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave


Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)
This must be the fake pink guy. He's an incredible clone of the original, just with the extra intelligence to speak and rap better. Probably the next best thing to. Still you can't beat the original.
Switched from Tyler, the Creator to this because it was easier to explain to my parents.
If I had a voice like that I wouldn't care if my apartment was a mess either
Frank and Aesop Rock should make an albumn together, or maybe with Slug lol
5 seconds after this comment is posted im gonna jump out my window
Can't wait for Pink Season to come out
is the cigarette needed for this recipe Francis?
I wanna see Brandon Rodgers and Frank  collab üòÇüòÇ
"Bring back jojivlog" 
- Retards

Lol when I saw the title thought u were roasting Rice Gum
Is that BMO at 2:23?
In class I was listening to this with my headphones (Arts teacher lets us listen to music) and at the beginning of the video my headphones started shaking xD
Franku vs RiceGum?
Filthy frank is a god rapper better than Eminem
filthy frank and tyler creator need to xollab on a music video
I'll fuck u in the mouth again-pink guy
I love these songs
he can shove his crusty nigger cock in my butt any time
Frank should get his own YouTube Red show
This is perfect music for a violent masturbatory session!
*Holy fuck this is good*
üçô
Jelly filled doughtnuts are my favorite
Is frank still in college
Still better hip hop than drake
You're actually really good at making music. If you had a separate Channel purely made of this of subscribe immediately.
Omygoodness
1:13 pink guy is explained his life
OMFG ITS PINK OMEGA! That's what these hos will be saying if you keep this shit up big boss. Keep killen' it.

Joji's music is hella underrated he has a talent.
What happened to papa laifu?
x1.25 Thank me later. Also FUCK YOU B0SS.
Holy shit dude im so FUCKING HIGH WITH THIS .
Your delivery and creativity is orgasmic Dad.
Frank drops more fire than RiceGum ever will.
he is actually a good rapper he just needs to change the lyrics a bit
Frank's now smoking cigarettes?! That you can legally buy in shops?! I hope my parents don't catch me watching this - this shit should be age restricted.
My mom thought this was a legit tutorial...
they need ur music on pandora
Yeeeww!
Poppa frankue is sempai
the like to dislike ratio is almost orgasmic
Hey, that's mildly adequate!
That beat is actually amazing. You honestly would get signed with a contract.
I really love the base at the beginning.

HE'S LITERALLY EXCEPTIONAL AT EVERYTHING
he's better than Kanye
Good music doesn't exi.............
This is high quality music

low key listening for subliminal messages about the fake frank

Lahbie.

kinda sounds like Tyler the Creators style
I fucking love that track. He could be a very good rapper...
this makes me think of tyler the creator XD
I wanna see a collab with Rich Chigga
why is he not making rap anymore miss these stuff
I think he dosent need a microwave
you need to do a song with rich chigga

Great musician
Man you make sick beats.
Fuck. The ad before this was for kids bop. Weirdly enough it felt part of the video.
Your house look like fucking shit.
cleans rice
puts some cigarette ashes after
The bass on this though
I actualy put this song on my mixtape and in the car i put it in and when this song came on my friend was like WTF but at the end  he was like 'holy shit this is fire'. :P
It's funny because he's roasting fan and hater alike with the lyrics. Yes you with the "Pretty good music in actuality!!" comments and "OMG HIS VOICE IS LIKE X AND MAKES ME WET!!!" guys.

This is the corey in the house reboot intro
when franks house is cleaner than your own.
not my proudest fap...
Beat dropped harder than me.
this should be in your lyrics :
"22 o clock
hard as a rock
ready to fuck (yup)
I'm talking bout my cock!"
lets just take moment and embrace the awsomeness that is a man who decides to cook traditional japanese cuisine and rap.........HE IS THE HERO WE NEED
The way that rice ball stuck to the window at the end... This mufucka can make some damn quality rice balls mannnnn!!
i wish frank was on OF 4 years ago

"If you wanna live, you gotta stay filthy"
I want to die

Pink Guy needs to take up an actual rap career

Who is funnier Angry Grandpa or Filthy Frank
Become a rapper franku

I played this in school and started a conga line like Twenty people where behind me
Woah it got real when he started talking üòÇ
feels good listening to franks actual voice lol
I wonder if weed was legal where pink guy lived if he'd be smoking it instead of nasty cigarettes on his videos.
Can we get the instrumental of this please? It's pretty bumping b0ss.
This song is actually better good
this is what starts the fire in my mixtape
Why's your chair only got two legs?
he brings up such a good point i try to get across to so many people. music is music. if you cant jam to frank sinatra and to tyler the creator or to saosin or to so many other fucking bands, you really dont appreciate music for what it really is. even if you dont like a song, respect that the artist took time out of their day to bring you a song and thats more than what most people can do
do this nigga live in a traphouse or something?
Yeah Yeah Your Free For Now But Wait Untill HowToBasic Gets You With Your Buddy Again...
üî•

They need this song on Spotify
"Music is music. If you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem."
Ayy
Aw fuck a cat anti teen smoking ad played. The cringe is real.
This is REAL music. Fuck the people who say it isn't
This rap got me pregnant
Ugh his songs make me wet
Best part at 1:12
Is that actually his apartment?

Lob
2:50 gg no re m4+4
the starting part sounds like a song from fallout 3
he drops honest rhymes...brutal, but honest
hold on.  Does he have a different voice then a scratched up,  dying sounding noise coming out of his mouth?
Is it weird if I actually like these songs?
I disabled ad block just for franku's crispy rice balls
Can you see the chem trails now
Filthy Frank is gut, aber was ist der ganzen Kost√ºm etwa?

The Asian pink man is on fleek

He needs to work with Tyler the creator like ASAP
Hands down to the king!
This is fire.
favorite love song all the time :)
Fire
Analog 2 and Jamba by Tyler The Creator are basically ever Pink Guy song lol
Beat flopped harder than magikarp using splash.
He could easily be a rapper for a living.
Come on I just finished watching fried noodles (not complaining though).
holy shit this bass is disgusting - I love it
Hey FilthyFrank, your raps are actually very good xD
dat sax tho
Is that a contrabass saxophone in the background?
sounds like Earl Sweatshirt
this is realest shit you'll hear tbh
my dad taught me how to make these
radiator pipe... k
Filthy Frank is the epitome of every cynical being
this guy makes me wonder why and how people could dislike rap
Fuck you just scared the shit out of me those beats hit my speakers hard!
I really respect that "speech" at the end there. It's so true. Keep making music. We love you, Pink Omega! ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
When is pink guy album 2.0 coming?
absolute anthem
Why does this come up for "anyways here's wonderwall"?
I think I know why he has cancer
i find it funny that hes actually a good rapper and singer and then does this shit lol
this has some hella bass

shakes my fucking walls with my sub bruh
yo dad, wanna hook us up with a link to download this beat?
reminds me of tyler the creator :√û
FIRE
What's the midi controller he's using at the beginning, while he's in the bath tub?
him and tyler should collab
Picture this....Tyler the creator and filthyFrank?
I don't need a microwave!!
Yeah, Japan already got nuked.
If everything goes south for Pink Guy he could do some rap and singing or beat production no joke
this dude make some sick ass music tho
If you listen closely, that tapping sound is franks shotgun pumping.
this is what i call good mysic x'D
He should make more Music Vidoes, i mean he only could do music :D cuz hes rlly good :D i rlly like it, and FRIED NOODLES :D

Killer whales Cohort
THE BASS IS FUCKING STRONG IN THIS ONE!!

This song is better then most of the shit I hear on the radio! Congrats TVFilthyFrank you have made another masterpiece
THE FOOKIN' BASE BOSS!
2:43 o shit he's talking normally.
Yo Frank makes some badass beats. He could easily be a producer, hes got a good ear, vision and understanding.

I actually seriously listen to this
is that really his home?
Starngely, this made me learn how to make rice balls
1:25 I like the part where the bottle nearly nailed it, then fell over and died like a bitch. Poetry.
Art.
damn 01:12 boiiii
no lie. the Beat is beautiful af its like so chill and turn up at the same time
I'm hesitant to subscribe and like and give this views because he smokes, and so the money he makes from me will at least in part go to cigarettes... But because he is such an incredible artist with so much creative genius I think I have to. I just wish he didn't smoke.
The Piano was such a nice touch
His voice low key hawt as hell
kys
I made onigiri tonight for dinner. Just thought you should know.
lyrics?
He is actually sick at making music
COMMENT SECTION 
I HAVE AN IDEA
damn this guy is talented!
Hmm.. Thats pretty good!

Funky shit man. I like it
In all honesty, I would lowkey ask Papa Franku to marry me.
I never spank my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday.
Holy shit this beat.
Frank is a better rapper than any of these famous rappers. His lyrics, while vile, are much more intricate than modern rap. Props to him.

...And I just downloaded the full album after listening to 3 songs.
Papa Frank lives in this shithole, wow
this is dope though
Frank should make more vids like this one.
I came from rice gum xD
Filthy Frank and Tyler creator make a song together, id watch it. and then be admitted to a padded room.
He's pretty good

Ching Ching bing bong
1:12 sounds like some fckin Samurai Champloo ost XD The flow is crispy mate

Í∑∏ÎÉ• ÎÇ¥ Îò• ÍπåÏßÄ Í∞ÄÏ°± Ïî®Î∞ú
wait is his house really that messy or does he fuck it up for the video settings

im dying help
so is this pink guy or pink omega
Why does this video make my pussy so wet
The "like oh" part is 5435890/10
the worst part is that it's actually really good music
The beat is fucking killer. Lyrics need work.
"Ill fuck you with a radiator pipe"
That beat is fire üî•
lets all go to the lobby, lets all go to the lobby, lets all go to the lob, lob, lobloblob, lob be be, lob, lob, loblob, be
at least we know he drinks good beer from those stella bottles
This beat goes hella hard
i feel like pink guy is actually depressed and doesn't know how to cope with it
The last good video by Franku
Nigger Barz
From 1:12 you can tell its inspired by some of Tyler the creators stuff if you get what I mean listen to the album WOLF and you'll see what I mean.
Hear it on 1.25 speed ! its sounds so sick haha
üëåüèΩüëåüèΩüëåüèΩ
this was a awesome rap o.o nice good frank! :D keep up the good work!!
wait so does he actually smoke outside of his videos or does he do it for entertainment purposes? ive always wondered....
Incredible
I'm pinkguy's #1 fuccboi
Why is this better than 90% of mainstream music lol?
eu mesmo n√£o entendendo nada eu acho esse cara foda
I like how frank was real with us for a second there
White version of Tyler the creator
You are a very talented man.  I hope you know that. :)
Is papa Franky Korean?
He needs a record deal... Like right now
lobbeeee lolo lo lo lo lobbyyy
pink guy looking like a dapper muther fucker towards the end there
never understood why ppl want "real music" like this shit is fuckin rad u guys fuck u talkin about
sounding like watsky a bit
This is actually fire
anyone got the og instrumental?
that be very nice ty
this plus furry porn equals the best wank ever
nice cancer m87
I didn't know Frank smoked :/
The fucking ad before the video was uncle bens rice!
I actually rock this shit in my car ngl
I swear...He brings me life
This was a very educational tutorial on how to make rice balls! Thank you!
Why you are so SEXUAL??
I think I can beat Frank in a rap battle, anyone agree?
The beat makes sex seem like it can be applied to the upper orifices, other than the mouth.
he should join odd future
So when you gonna get a record deal and quit being a fucking casual :^)
thats a really good song, without the words
What's that piano sample?
Pink guy x Tyler the creator
this is kinda catchy
this song is actually pretty good!
hope you know this "not real music" kicks ass
Still better than "watch me"
We get it, you vape
What if I told you the song us in the key of D ?
Microwave
Fuck he is like a Japanese Tyler
My reaction to the comments: ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Why is ksi on Spotify but this isn't
PINK GUY NEEDS TO GO ON TOUR
Dude's actually so talented.
whe-when you and f-frank have the same dining chairs
what studio does he use?
ribbit
The best line by far is: "I don't need a microwave, because I'm already heated." It's so bad it's good.
I suck dick
I suc dick
I suc dick
I suck dick
I suk dick
Gutter brought me here :D
thanks for the recipe
at 1:24 I swear it sounds like BMO saying "Finn" over and over again
Dude I don't know why I'm telling u this but my house has like an other room downstairs and there's another family living there and there's some guy down there screaming or somthing wtf...he's probably drunk or high or just mad. But I'm just here listening to filthyfrank lol
Waiting for spotify..
what the fuck is up w that shower lolol. tile stuck to a piece of plywood shimmed w 2x4s 6 inches off the wall. that is classic. wtf. frank, u do that renovation?
DAT BOI
i need this beat
I assure you guys that this is best listened to with the speakers CS-603 Pioneer
pink sheep vs pink guy... 
all i have to say
He looks like tingle from The legend of zelda lol
Who else thinks this guy needs to be guest stated on ridiculousness
wtf did i just watch
He just might be How to Basics
But im not a rapper
watch this at 1.25 speed. it just makes it better
Why does Pink Guy only SPEAK during his rap vids?
I still like the erectile dysfunction beat better
clearly channeling the ghost of nujabes
What camera does FF use?
Vape in my pussy and call me your meme slut
this guy's actually a good rapper
This is better than Tyler The Creator.

Frank walks into a club and gets all the pu$$ies but when the bitches realize they fucked a weirdo on youtube, regrets appear faster than dick warts
This song, of course, is only in PG's mind. In reality, he's just like "Ey b0ss i have a cancer" and "EAYDNFHFHSDND" repeatedly.
who else watches him and follows his cooking and it turns out the shit is really good
Franku-San... Why? You... I need to get away... YOUVE TURNED INTO RAPPER. I DONT WANT YOUR MIX TAPE. HOW DARE YOU. I... Need to leave.... You...
I watch all these videos religiously
nice rice
this song is fucking lit, goddamn. i was deaf but after being exposed to this fire, i can hear now
the "LABBHEE" has haunted me.
cool
His apartment is fucking disgusting dude
10/10
This is the best song! So catchy and I swear it's my favourite.
that fuckin beat tho
The beat is awesome
this is no doubt the most legit track you've ever made
FUCK ME DADDY
Pink Omega - Kung Pao
seriously wtf man frank can flow
Lyrics? Please
i came here to enjoy myself before killing myself
Can I clean ur place? It's bothering me. XD
Pink guy or Tyler, The Creator?
papa franku i downloaded this song and listened it at school over and over again
Still better than Kanye West
what did he make the beat with?
You know Frank is a smart guy when he can rap in his second language
pink mang
Pick guys have barz
Colab with Tyler, the Creator pls <33
The bass in this song is insane. Thanks franku senpaii i came 5 times.
i want ur glasses
frank.......... DONT TELL ME YOURE AN INTERNET RAPPER. YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THIS.
boss
ONIGIRI
FRANKU  X TYLER NEEDS TO HAPPEN
i like the way he sampled that beat
This is Lowkey my favorite song. Other than kill your self.
A comment with the lyrics is what we need.
when the beat started I was like, "wow this is good shit"
used as a real rice ball tutorial
Still my favorite pink guy rap
this is really fucking great
Cuz im always heated!¬†THATS NOT FUNNY!
nice mix of funny lyrics and killer beats!
I sung this whole song at my school talent show ........ expelled but worth it
I honestly wish he would release these on iTunes
PIANO DROP IS SO INSANE !
how do i play on loop?
At 1:14 he turns into Tyler, the creator
This makes me moist
We need frank on iTunes
id fuck
‰Ωï„Åß„ÄÅÁîü„Åç„Å¶„Çã„ÅÆ‚ùì
This beat kinda sounds like the one in the end of Jungle Boy
i thought this video was going to be its not
Please don't tell me this is where he actually lives lol
I bought a new headset just to hear the bass in this song. It was worth the $130.
Makes sense because his a japanese...trying not to be racist...... But it's f*cking weird man
Is that his real house
Sounds Like " Raw Beat " instead of Lobby at the beginning.
good shit
I ate the acid by accident again. shit.
I really enjoy this shit yo.
Stop being a fucking useless meme and express your talent and become a rapper damn, you have talent
Lobby
9 out of 11 best anal i had in 3 years. I had some damn good anal when I was 6 though
onigiri wo tabemasu
im just wondering is this guy dead im not sure if he killed himself or old age or whatever? is he still alive if he is i cant find any new videos
LOO-LOO LOOB BY
How is this the best rap ive ever heard?
Is he Japanese? Because he has Japanese writing on his wall and he did this rice ball video...
first video I've ever liked for this channel. idkw tho
tbh you should become a raperr
im getting  tyler the creator vibe
Sounds like a typical Earl Sweatshirt beat
i watch this every day
still not as good as Politikz's Hand on my gat.
I have to listen to this song at least five times a week or I'll die.
I put this and some of the pink guy album songs in my dads car playlist, he doesn't understand English and I'm enjoying it
Easily my second favourite rapper, not playing nigro
The beat is dope mate
Tyler the creator much
can someone call asap rocky and tyler the creator to do an album with him?
a e s t h e t i c s
i want to kill myself :)
dic
I love this song and the other but I am actually concerned for his health, I really hope he's doing alright.
the fact that their lyrics actually flow and the beat is lit af just makes it all even better
wait so is frank 100% jap?
hes an impressive cook to be honest
Dope ass bass
badass song. I love when 1:12 comes in
I want a pink guy shirt that says I don't need a microwave
Never eat at filthy franks house
rice balls and fried noodles is fire
Gotta be honest, this is some of the best cinematography i have ever seen in a youtube video.
what is this ??
should we laugh ??
serious question !
the sad thing is. this is better than 90% of todays music
E-Dub, No?
wow another nice song
I love cooking videos
papa franku's raps cleanses my soul
Rice balls > Fried noodles
you gain some weight üò∂
Sir frank the filth everybody

@FilthryFrank love your vids, but what's up with the constant mess of your home. by the way is HowtoBasic really a guy?!

i was a fan but now i am an air conditioner
The only rice balls that you can eat are at the bottom of my dick.
I love how he doesn't give a shit about viewers
TYLER THE CREATOR WANNABE!







this is damn good though
Beat so hot it lit my cigaret
I actually listen to all his songs unironically
Frank is a kind of guy that are smart af but acts like an idiot
Welcome to the terror dome.
the upper echelon, investing on these large balls.
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese. 
killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals.
I'm just tryna stangle these fuckers.
I'm just tryna strangle these fuckers. 
I'm just tryna strangle these-

this the beep blop. 
you make the beat flop.
breathing more Kush in than the seat got, so we got the beat droppin harder than your son's balls at 12, 
not to mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock.

I'll fuck you in the mouth again,
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo, I be hearin shit,
so don't be fucking me, cuz bet your ass I'm hearing it.

Fuck your dog, I can smack at your teeth.
and I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe.

(what, is that too rude?)

I'm a fucking nuisance with different types of abuses, I'm running up in the premises helping you tie your nooses, cuz all of you fucks are clueless, and do not know how to do this, I act retarded kn stage and then put my fingers in pussies like
Like Oh.
Oh. 
Oh.

I fuck around for money like a cam whore, 
jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some GAY SHIT.
I fight your dad in the parking lot and/or beat their fucking teeth in cuz they RAISE SHIT. 
You sound like:
"I never spank my kids, and I raised a piece of shit, and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday."
oh
This one's for the folks that be dead inside.
mini-golf champions, you got no drive, playa.
fuckbois treat my dick like a trampoline.
I only work with paper like a fax machine.

I'm on the car hood, screaming like a mammal, ripping through the flannel, burning ass on my chest with a camel.
I'm here to be an act, not a role model.
don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle.

I'm just chillin, making rice balls
errday.
I'm a simple man,
I don't need a microwave.
I don't need a microwave.

Cuz I'm already heated
(that's not funny)

UUUH WE WANT REAL MUSIC. WE WANT REAL MUSIC WE WANT CHOJI MUSIC.

Bruh, I didn't even know that real and fake music existed. I think it's kinda your fault for separating that shit into categories.
Like, music is music, if you don't think this is music, like, that your fucking problem. Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video, ya know?
whatever, man. It's ya boy, Pink guy, PinkOmega, whatever the fuck you want to call, me, comin at ya, still doin that wacky crazy shit, bruh. ain't nothing changed.

i feel bad for your window
He can rap
He should put this on iTunes.
he uses the og method and not the wrap one
respeck
Lobby
I think this place is giving me the fear...
How did he catch the cig in his mouth??? XD
I find it quite likely that papa franku solely started smoking to look more swaggish
I am for fucking real this beat is absolute fire lol.
Pink Guy songs are better than most famous songs
why did i watch his videos.....
this is honestly such a good song I want his music on spotify
Bad internet rapers :v
He might be weird as FUCK but he's a good song writer
love this and FRIED NOODLES plz make more like itttttttt
Tingle, from Legend of Zelda.
0:37 is a beautiful wallpaper
This is actually dope though...
yo can someone tell me some songs that are like this (from filthy frank or not) i wanna hear more things like this
I want to hug him. He's adorable. And hella cool. Like jfc.
what program you use??
This is the new slim shady
the filthy frank channel is a delicate ecosystem, basically 13 year old kids find him edgy and a way to escape there drug addict father so they subscribe then 50 year old predators see all the kids with no self esteem and subscribe and act like 13 year old faggot memers to catch kids to sell to the African sex trade. then the kids grow up in Africa when they are fifty they move back to america and see all the kids on filthy frank's channel and go on the hunt for 13 year olds, and the system repeats
I would love to see him as a member of Odd Future
This song gives me life
the transition at 1:14 is really reminiscent of tyler the creator
I bet 150k views are mine, fuck im addicted
Isn't let's all go to the the lobby from every movie in the world?
so what kind of grain of rice did you use?
U smoke too much frankus
Man, this actually sounds like Nujabes on meth.
this is actually aesthetic af
Made my first rice balls ever today!
This is my favorite of your raps, the "Lobby" loop is so innovative, truly impressed.
Frank drops more bars than a jail cell.
orange guy
this is one of my favorite songs
can we have a pink omega vs politikz rap battle
Not gonna lie, ya gots Beats bOss
Beat is golden
this shits firer
I want to party with you guys so bad haha it would be epic asf
do you ever clean your house pinkomega?
This is probably one of the best videos on TVFilthyFrank
my new favorite song
drop the beat like people with polio
his stove is much cleaner here than compared to his newest song.
Filthy frank as Django 2:24
+TVFilthyFrank Hey Big Papa I need the Rice Balls!
I Like Corey in the house as well its a really good anime I get that we like the same shit.
you are cancer
Not even lying he songs are actually fire. like foreals i get Tyler the Creator vibes
Dude that "let's all go to the lobby" they play that as the commercial for Regal theaters right?
Frank you sound you sound just like Jedbrii, thats an Australian rapper or something
Why do people call onigiri rice balls if they're triangle shaped?
so catchy
1:23 Is that Hatsune Miku? Fucking weeaboo.
Your bath tub is fucking shit dude what is made out of??
What DAW did he use??
One of the best Pink Guys songs. Right?
press 4 over and over again for him to keep saying retarded
1:10
this really is my favorite out of all these songs
Anyone have a link or video of his side music ? .o.
I'm not a fan of rap at all, at least not what rap has become, anyway I really think this is really good.
His lyrics, beats, and delivery is all golden. It's like the few gems that you find on soundcloud. It's like that new age shit.
1:27 what happened to the rest of that chair?
My least favorite part was 3:24
Hello, New Spice here, 

Look at yourself in the mirror.
Then look back at the comment.
Look at yourself again,
Look at the comment,
Open google chrome/ new tab,
go to google.com,
Type into google "Bleach sales near me"
Proceed to drive to the destination
Buy bleach,
Put bleach bottle without cap into your mouth
Down the bottle of bleach.
Proceed to masturbate to midget bbw dolphins under the sea.
(IF YOU ARE POOR)
Go to the bleach sale,
Ask for a "free sample"
Then proceed to chug down the bottle of bleach in front of your mother because you are 12 and you can't drive, then choke on the bottle cap after poisoning yourself so you die from lack of oxygen intake.
Rice balls are gross.
his place a hot mess
Was that BMO saying "Fin"
is the bathtub thing a proleter refference?
I'm happy to say that i finally learned this song completely! Now i can officially commit suicide! :D
If Tingle smoked weed, he'd be this guy
This music is actually really good, you're really talented man, keep makin music
why aren't you on Spotify? üò≠
how many cigarettes did you waste?
i'm not joking but this shit is fucking lit asf
needs more raps like this!
papafranku in glorious 60fps
u got bars franku...
It's actually a good song





in a way...
This beat üî•üî•üî•
Love your music man, can't wait to see what other music you have in store for us :)
This feels Tyler, The Creator inspired
Nice shades, bruh.
Pink Omega? Has Pink Guy finally transcended life?
Does this mean we also get Alpha Frank, or Beta Man?
This song is awesome. I love the cinematography! So... Fight Club-ish... Know what I mean?
pink guy has a beard
born in the wrong generation...





XD OH WAIT!
Frank, plz just for one video speak with your normal voice. sorry if how you speak in videos IS your normal voice XoXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOx
This guy reminds me of Tingle from Zelda
Hontestly, i think this is a really good song
The instrumental is actually really good XD
BRUH I DIDNT KNOW YOU WERE SUCH A GOOD FUKIN RAPPER MAN YOU FUCKING KILLED IT
I listen to this seriously.
Could you create a playlist with all your beats without the lyrics so we can do some weird shit with 'em ?
1:11 to 1:36 is my favorite
I want a feature from Papa Frank
I love this beat!
SHIIIET THE BASS
this is suprisingly good
This is my driving around song.
Jerk it to my my titties, pop it off on some GAY SHIT
This rap just has me listening to it over, over, over, and over!
The beat gives me an everlasting orgasm
dig ur songs, FRANKIE
"oh yeah this actually really good wow this is actually good actually frank the creator you should actually make more of these frank the creator"
Everyone who makes these kinds of comments, shut up.
I feel sorry for that apartment...
is that his real voive
I would pay to see you live .
this guy should have tours
Real talk. Best rice ball instructional ever.
I feel like Frank is turning Pink Guy into the real him so he can still express his actual views without there being an uproar about it.
There needs to be a Pink Guy and Tyler, the Creator collab.
yumm
i want his glasses
I make similar content to this good man. Praise me, praise him.
definitely the best Pink Guy rap.
2:33-2:35 that smile tho...~>_<~
1:52 close your eyes...


//nosebleeds ‚âßÔπè‚â¶
This shit is fire
I hope his house is that messy on purpose.
Frank > Eminem > Kanye
Fucking love the chorus
love this track so much omg
the rapping is so reminiscent to Tyler, the Creator in 2011
liked kill your self better
Despite all the shit you did in this video I still somehow want rice balls from watching this video.
Does anyone else think that he would actually be a decent cook if he didn't mess around and make a mess all the time?
put that speed on 1.25
1:46 That is fucking golden, I can't stop laughing
rap master 9.0
Yo Frank is low key killing the rap game
Art
This is art!!
still can't get enough of this after all these months
The title track turns to 'Onigri' if you download from youtubetomp3. 's pretty cool.
Was that cat food or tuna
ey b0ss can u stop being so talented pls
still the best pink guy song
Frank spits hotter shit than the ovens in Auschwitz.
All of a sudden, I want to be Pink Guy

"I learn japanese from anime"
Has anyone else thought if he smokes outside of these videos?
I'd fucking pay him to clean. Jfc.

When people hate on younger kids: "Bro, you're going to die before me, thanks for the midlife crisis." 
#MediocreShirt
NYEEEES b00s i got my p00sy wet
This is my new ringtone.
When you realize pink guy music is better than most modern artists
he doesnt need a microwave
Awesome video

The moon outside, at the beggining <3
I'm just tryna strangle NFKRZ
Welcome to the terror dome
this is probably my favourite video on the internet xD
I listen this song whenever something good happens. It makes the moment better ^-^

Fo real tho your rapping is so good
so edgy

My friends dislike filthy Frank I told em to fucking kill themselves they didn't. o well it was just a prank.

Anybody know what Papa Franku uses to make these beats? I like the shitty sounds

I wonder how dirty his house is...
I would love to see pink guy and action bronson rap together.
lob lob lob,lobbyby, lob lob lobbyby
WTF

This some bomb ass shit.
How the fuck does this guy make me laugh and feel hungry and horny at the same time?

niggerfaggot
I never spanked my kids
This is heat but if he used actual rap lyrics my house would burn down
This is my song for the apocalypse.
FAVORITE SONG WISH IT WAS ON I TUNES BC IVE BEEN LISTENING ON REPEAT FOR 2 weeks
"Lets all go to the lobby!"
Holy shit the bass

Tbh I can't tell which is better, this or Chloe Burbank.
I played this at school and the fire alarms went off
Dat 60FPS tho. I came nigga !
0:53 to 1:11 is the best part :3
Does he accually smoke?
Frank is my dad. ISIS
this is like a fusion between Bastard-era Tyler the Creator and Das Racist.

My nigga T!
Papa Franku 2016!
best song to listen to at 4:20
Is that Frank's voice?
You should do real life videos
is it weird that i got hard when he slam the rice down
Filthy can always switch careers to being a rapper if this toob stuff doesnt werk out
Can I lick ur beard?
I'm looking for the Instrumental for the song with the part from 1:11.. It's honestly the best drop I've ever heard and it makes me so sad that I cant get it....
let's all go to the Bobby???

was it???
Why does this go so hard....why...
Yo can you try to make a mashup of lov u and medicine ?

Frank don't be fucking up your health fam
nujabes???
He's an actually good rapper! Now let's hope he makes a career off of this.
shits lit
I think this video's kind of a fuck you to all the idiot fans who reacted negatively to the FilthyFrank exposes himself video, but also making fum of the other people who want to hear his 'real' music.
Or it could just be an awesome video, but whatever man
Soooooooooooo what about that new pink guy album HUH??
My manz pink got dem bars
ugh his feet!
I find his slight dick outline oddly satisfying
him and tyler the creator would be üî•üî•üî•
So this is where Pink Guy went.
glad to know he washes his rice
his rapping kinda reminds me of childish gambino
i cant even with this song i love this
The likes on this video are crazy!!!
Tyler the creator type of song
LAHB
These songs are actually super fucking tight, make more!
Frank a lot of people weren't sad you ended up having stokes, I'm among that list. You don't deserve life racist.
Papa Franku vs ricegum
I want race balls now lol, i like when everything got all mellow, make more music frank its the shit!!
u guys are clueless as shit.......I only ACT retarded on stage! - Filthy Frank exposed
2:36 onwards  Dayumn pink guy dropping some truth bombs
"This was to the folkes that be dead inside"
I feel personally adressed.

I can  get this song on the Piratebay right?
This sounds like a Tyler the creator type beat it has style to it I like it you should do moreeee
"best tutorial ever, 20/10" - ign
I played this in a black neighborhood and got my ass kicked. did I crieing my fucking eyes out yes. did I look edgie while doing it strait off the kitchen counter. did it make my friend watching piss him self yes.

pink guy 2.0
Bars .
Wait he smokes?!?!?!

Does Frank smoke?
This made me really sad for some reason
Better than Die Antwoord. You should consider a music career and do proper videos.
Let's all go to the lobby...
that shit got some nice beat
Dude you crayziiiiiiiiii
I learned how to basically make rice balls while being entertained lol
hey, that's pretty good.
y'all talking about pink guy rapping skills/filthy frank but if you listen carefully, the lyrics are for all of his cancerous fanbase

the part "We Want real music"
"We want joji's musics" killed it
1375 are not ricenation
I s that his real voice btw?
doesnt he make like alot of money with youtube? I like that he still lives humble or at least it looks like it
pink guy got the moves
THAT LINE ABOUT JOJI'S "SERIOUS MUSIC" OOOOOHHHH SSHHHHIIIIITTTT SON
Looo lo-lob by by-by
Welcome to the rice fields!

Man, that's a BEAUTIFUL rice ball--  a nice set of hairy, balls making hot loads of HIV semen! I'd love to have you impregnate a some of my CD4 cells. Then I'd have a strain of your descendants living in me always. Very Hot! Happy Fucking, Brother!

That base doe
Finally 2 mil bro
You seem like one chill mother fucker. I'd want to hang out with you one day (even though that would never happen).
Thanks for the rice balls tutorial.
Not gonna lie. Rice balls are the easiest and quickest things to make and they're tasty as fuck
Other than dabbing the cigarette ashes in the rice, that looks pretty good.

Can someone please direct me to the nearest recipe page for these large balls...

XD
(but really, those rice balls look good)
I kind of want this displayed in the MOMA 24/7. But, honestly, it's too good for it.
Papa Franku's rapper voice is the hottest thing I've ever heard.
The beat is weally good
Does Joji actually smoke?
edgy.
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the terror dome;¬†the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these

[Verse 2]
This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

[Interlude]
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 3]
I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday" This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role model
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave

Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)

[Outro]
(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem
Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video at the same time, you know?
Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time

LISTEN TO RICE BALLS/ONIGIRI

Ôøº
He's like a talented version of tyler the creator.
Mini golf champion you got no drive.. OHHH SHITT
i act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pussies ohhh
;)
When are we going to get a PapaFranku x Tyler the creator song
Welcome to the tether dome
the upper achelone investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese  
Killer whales hump backs and these narwals
Im just tryna strangle these fuckers
Im just tryna strangle these fuckers
Im just tryina strangle these

I obviously did not get everything, help
sounds like tyler the creator vibes
best track ive ever heard. i sound like a jive boy. i dont need a microwave.
1:12 When Franku goes legit
Any rap by pink guy is better than any rap by any mainstream rapper. But hey, that's just my opinion...
honesly, frank is really talented like wtf
I love you Georgeüíñ you're the best. Your characters are pure genius
The description.... Did he half predict that cancerous damn Daniel meme?
Only frank could make making rice balls look cool in a pink morph suit
he cant even afford a lighter
This is some surprisingly good shit...
The white Tyler
I would date him
DUDE UR VOICE IS AWESOME !!!
I would rather listen to Papa Franku's dank shit than the crap that gets pumped into the radio today.
Ladies and gentleman,we got a new Action Bronson up in this bitch
why does he have alot of subs and money but has a shit room
0:17 it sounds like 'raw beef' instead of 'lobby'
Reminds me of (The Professional )
this shit is #fireemoji
why does this sound like something tyler the creator would release
I Love this üòÇ
Every time i make ramen I start singing this without realizing....SO WIERD
love this beat
I don't need a microwave
10/10 ign will use for call of duty rice balls online black warfare 69
Someone give me the lyrics please
" 'muhh we want real music we want joji music' -Bruh i didn't even know fake music existed. I mean it's your fault for putting that shit into categories. If you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem. Like, who says i can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video you know. Whaddup man, it's yo boy pink guy PinkOmega, whatever the fuck you wanna call me idgaf. Still doing that wacky ass shit bro ain't nothing changed so see you next time."
*And that is why i love this guy*
2M
This is the fucking reason I like Joji. Hes Japanese. He eats the good shit, and everybody is like ewww, fuck them cunts.
Anyone else think frank could make it as a rapper? He ain't bad at all and I hate rap.
This actually makes me want to cook some tuna-stuffed rice balls
EVERYTHING SONG FRANKU MAKE IS LIKE ZE LULLABY!!!
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeah!
Can we please have the full beat version?
i actually learned how to cook onigiri so thanks bro
Damn your kitchen is a fucking mess
I don't like rap......... But this shit is amazing.
He is here to be an act not a role model, you hear that 14 year old fucking cancer kids?
I'm scared
George , just do whatever and be whoever and whatever you want. Don't let fucking people choose for you, don't let people say you HAVE to be either "Filthy Frank" or "Joji". At first I thought you were depressed becasue you always wanted to be joji, but I realised that you are an entertainer and you like doing this, and I think letting people tell you that you should be this and do this and that is stupid. Just do whatever you want man, ignore the people that try to choose for you.
I'm a spirit lyrical miracle individual

Your talented
Oppai > Onigiri
I watch this literally every day before school to get my "fuck you" mindset warmed up.
This song is the equivalent of Rick's "Let me out".

Frank, you should really just give less fucks about what the cancerous, immature part of your fandom says/thinks.

And think more about us, the better part of your fandom. We want your love, great hip-hop music and cancer.

Frank do you listen to Tyler the creator, because your music is very similar to his.
You are god.
I actually like the musik you made. Great moves, keep it up Ethan proud of you ;)
Franku, you shouldn't smoke, you could get cancer.
Oh, wait...
Cool song
Please do more of the dank rap bars
OMG Looking out your window, I know what part of Queens you're in. My sister's apartment was in that area!

I actually really enjoy the beat lel
This deserves way more views!
"WE WANT REAL MUSIC. WE WANT JOJI MUSIC."
Do a video on how to get over your ex that would be jokes af
Help me tie my noose :(
this fanbase is really cringe
"I only listen to real music"
pink guy makin sure I don't starve over here
pinkeye fuckin those beats up

1:46-1:52 I don't know why but I laugh really hard at this part every time I hear it
Franku is looking extra Asian in this video.
fuck you filthy frank. you should go nose fucking with sofloantonio you both jewish degenerates
sounds like something that tyler the creator would make
Hmmm 1.25 speed still sounds fucking EPIC
man ur filthy
best house ever. you have a bed in the toilet, and in the bath you have a music remjxer player. and you have sound emitters in the whole house
1k people got fucked by radiator pipes
ughhh ................. I swear I got a cold from first time¬†watching your videos 2 days ago
omg put the madafakin lyrics in the description
Im afraid to open a bag rice now
Funny thing is, now I actually know how to make Rice balls from watching this xD
Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers 2x
I'm just trying to strangle these

This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday" This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role model
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave 4x

Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)

(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem
Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video at the same time, you know?
Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time

George Miller sounds like Bob from Bob's burger

...this video really made me want a smoke.
Occasionally a man will peek behind the the curtain and address the crowd amassing at his appearance, breaking the fourth wall so to speak. Sometimes the masses will get a glimpse into the life of the idealized or the idolized. I have to admit, the average fan of this channel has no idea of what I'm talking about. Maybe it's for the best. Keep doing what you do Frank, even if it's ironically.
I would pay for this song. Please get this on iTunes papa Franku!
franku has reached stage 5. promoting his own mixtapes. he needs to be put down ‚Ä¢^‚Ä¢ jk xD love you papa franku
What equipment is he using?
"I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe"

I died and went to the spiritual lyrical miracle individual heaven in the sky
Lyrical, miracle, spiritual individual 
papa franku taking it to tha h00dz
Put this on bandcamp
LOB LOB LOB LOBBY
instrumentals?
Rice balls very good b0ss
Lowkey lit
I Fucking hate people, so i just watch this to get away from their noise. #FuckPeople
What's funny to me is that there's real talent here.
Music and cinematography.
But it's never gonna get noticed because Papa Franku is a big no no for any respectable individuals out in the real world.

Ever see How to basics and FIlthy Frank on Youtube rewind? Nope. Yet they have some of the most popular channels.
This song was played at my prom
this is actually good, I'm scared
weaboo
watched this in home ed
Tbh frank has good rap voice

Holy shit üíØüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üíØüíØüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªüíØüíØüíØüíØüíØ

Why are there so many faggots with anime pictures
Yo, this shit is hard af

After watching this I think they're actually the same.
"I act retarded on stage but I put my fingers in pussies off stage"

Now "Reactonists" are reacting to filthyfrank videos, what do you think about that papa franku?
Had this song on normal volume with my sub near me, and after ten seconds my penis is already flying towards my stomach

niggers
Lyrics?

My base went crazy when the song started
I will go to his funeral being sad if he ever dies.
Where is new salamander album?

Lip-sync is atrocious.
What ze fuck did you just fucking say about me, you verdammter Jude? I'll have you know I graduated top of mein class in ze Hitlerjugend, and I've been involved in numerous secret Gestapo raids in Berlin, and I have over 300 confirmed executions. I am trained in gorilla gassing and I am ze top sniper in ze entire Wehrmacht. You are nothing to me but just another one race traitor. I will wipe you ze fuck out with precision ze likes of which has never been seen before on this Reich, mark mein fucking words. You think you can get away with saying zat schei√üe to me over ze Internet? Think again, arschloch. As vee speak I am contacting mein secret network of spies across Deutschland and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for ze storm, bl√∂del. Ze storm zat wipes out ze pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and zat's just with mein machinenpistole. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed kampf, but I have access to ze entire arsenal of ze Wehrmacht forces and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable arsch off ze face of ze Reich, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy blitzkrieg your little "clever" kommentar was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying ze price, you verdammter dummkopf. I will shit Zyklon B all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
well, at least hes not a bad internet rapper
really nice beat papa franku dropped this time
I'm a fan of George, no matter what persona. He's just a fucking awesome and chill guy, and I honestly feel kind of bad for him, for obvious reasons. But it's all good, he's above it. And he's doing what he loves, and not to mention, getting paid for it. Respect where respect is due.
dirty ass feet
why did they ask joji (frank) to make real music? i thought pink guy was the one who made the music O_o
Please become a famous rapper
When making rice balls am I required to put the end of a cigarette in the rice?

On a side note if you follow a pod of dolphins for long enough you'll discover  that the single most important aspect of dolphin society is the very same thing that prevents them from getting lung cancer... And what do we really mean by the term " Sex tourist "?

It's not a crime to dislike certain genres of music. I suppose I like rap a little, but only in a satirical way. I like order and sophistication in what I listen to, what I download, what I construct. Anyway, excellent video as always, Frank. Keep being filthy as possible.
1:11 is just perfect. Sounds like Earl Sweatshirt or Tyler the Creator. Amazing.
how's life been jo?

BARS!
KSI thinks he's good ? he should listen to this awesomeness , ksi is a fame-whore cunt

No one seems to realize this video is a direct response to all the people talking about JojiMusic and JojiVlogs and how he doesn't want to be your rolemodel like you all expect him to be...
this is some Odd Future Type Shit
This is actually hot.
I bet Pink Guy gets all the pussy.
I actually found this video while looking for a recipe for Rice Balls, glad I found it

Filthy and h3h3 are the baddest mother fuckers on youtube.
Best music video of the year.

Nice beat...... Faggot ;)
Is it sad this taught me how to make rice on the stove.....
Anyone ever notice how talented Frank actually is?
He can rap, dance, and cook.
He is funny, clever, and somewhat smart.
1:46 I just...words can't describe this.
60 fps Frank is best Frank
I don't need a microwave

What equipment does papa franku use? You can see plenty of it when he sits in the bath tube... Those beats are fucking dope man
pink guy and tyler the creator need a feature....
Now this is quality music
Cancer has been cured by being replaced. When cancer gets cancer its called frank. Thus Fr4N1K1 is the cure to cancer.
Filthy Frank is the Tits.... A cups of course lol jk Pink Guy killing the beat while prepping some fish meat

Pink guy should've been performing in Super Bowl
That's some good Bari Sax ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
This song is better than KSI's rap career
this was really really smooth though
Is it just me,or does anyone else get hungry from these?
HOLY FUCK! IS THAT JOJI VLOGS!!!??
"i'm here to be an act not a role model"
THIS IS SHIT
His voice sounds really good as the beat progresses.
Hilarious and original
this guy needs jesus
It's like Franku gives us cancer but then he cures it with awesome music.
Pink guys best rap yet
nah franku, I understand why you want to keep real life away from YouTube life but the true reason your fans what "more joji" is because  youre hot and the lot of your fan base are just looking for some dude they can obsess over. which in your case wouldn't be bad, but ayy you do you.
Is this guy literally influencing people to smoke blunt?! Besides that, this was so funny!
Can't stop listening to this, even while playing, I'm desperate to teach my gf what's Papa franku, our dad, any tip?
A E S T H E T I C
Is this you and if it is you should do more rap
what kind of camera does he use?? It looks fantastic
GOLF
I see papa franku gets down with the dirty verses 'n' beats.

Dude that was fire, my house is Burnt down but because of this.....
Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these

This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday"  This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role model
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls er'day I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave

Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)

(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem
Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video at the same time, you know?
Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time
when franku's voice gives you a boner, thanks george
Is this alternate dimension pink guy.
im really curious how he did the lighting for this.
i love swag pink guy
L I T ? üî•
2:36 - 2:40 was clean as fuck
North Korea
this is awesome I love that he can be funny AF and lit AF .
How can you invest in large balls I.E a nutsack?
can you make a new fucking video already
can you give a instrumental to this
Closest we are gonna get to his actual voice haha
Whoes singing...? Is it him?!??
Can I buy this on iTunes?
People don't understand that this video was just him in a bath tub and him making rice.
FRANK YOU FUKER. MAKE A INSTRUMENTAL TO THIS AS SOON AS YOU SEE THIS PLEASE. OTHERWISE I'LL SEND A ARMY OF SQUIRREL'S IN NORTH FACE JACKETS TO RAID YOU HOUSE
Praise Papa Franku!
The funny thing is that I'm sure Papa Frankfurt is well off financially since he gets good consistent views/likes, yet lives in shit places. 
He should be smart, save up, and get a house that's secluded from other people that way be can be even louder and obnoxious. Also invest in better equipment. Papa Frankfurt gotta evolve. üòè
Joji you should include yourself in the show, so people can know that your here too, not just some person hiding himself which I know your not doing(hopefully). This isn't a hate comment but start including yourself into the show man, for real
I have crippling autism
This guys weird af. But he's pretty darn talented.
Finally he made a real song.
Absolute fire! I love it!!
Grammy for best rice recipe
Beat is sick asf
A true masterpiece.
Why is frank's house so crap if he has so many subs he could afford better stuff or is it just a set?
I really don't understand why it's so terrible that people want Joji music (or even JojiVlogs). I agree that the people calling themselves "true fans" are cancer, but just wanting some more serious/chill content isn't much to ask in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy everything that Papa Franku creates, but I also thoroughly enjoy Joji content and unfortunately the world has seen very little of him. Even if it's just really quick unedited vlogs, a little break from Frank would be nice now and again.


I wasn't around when it happened, and I've heard about the amount of retaliation from the fans after he revealed himself, but I didn't think it was so bad as to where he's reluctant to be Joji at all.




EDIT: I just read his twitter post. It all makes sense now.
Lil B taught me how to cook - Pink Guy
nice meme
\pol\
thanks for aids u fucking faggot <3
XDXDXDXD
Handsome, can rap, cook. Bitches these days can¬¥t appreciate real men.

"I'm here to be an act not a role model."

Favourite part. Although its "By" from the word "Lobby" I think.
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the terror dome;¬†the upper echelon

Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;

[Interlude]
I'm a fucking nuisance

Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)

[Outro]
(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem

Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time

When your parents let you smoke for the first time
Don't kill me
But are Joji and Filthy Frank the same person?
I NEVER SPANKED MY KIDS AND I RAISED A PIECE OF SHIT
You're a filthy bastard, Filthy Frank.
yeah! Second favorite of the raps! (not an insult, the Ramen rap was just too good.) But why all the smoking?
awesome shit man!

Pink Guy > Lil Wayne
the bass is making my headphones shaaake
Odd Frank?
Anyone who says he should real music is dumb. This is real music there are no rules to art.
Frank, i fucking love you ;)
What do you use to make instrumentals for your raps? Does anyone else know?
Forreal doe, frank has insane delivery and his wordplay is clever as shit. fuck man, make some real songs plizzzz
Honestly, if you sit there and actually say "Oh what is "real music"" it's what I'm like with my own medium, "What is real art?"

Sure you have fun doing it and I think it's good stuff, but I can't help but call out on this.
Real music is something with true emotions, true ties, true depth. You do all the things you do because they're "fun", but that sounds half baked to me.

You're also being too literal about the subject, it isn't a case of "it's fake if it isn't "real"", if it isn't "real", it's just there.
I could make a track, beat, or piece of artwork that's a total joke but still argue that "Oh well - I - think it's real."

You choose to "do what you want" but in the end you just got mad because people preferred your other stuff rather than stuff that sounds like you're just trying to have a quick laugh. Where's the emotion in that? Where's the depth?

Sam Smith made a James' Bond song that wasn't anything like his usual music, a lot of people didn't like it.
He fucking literally said "I don't mind" and carried on. But you just pretty much began crying and ragequit, effectively hurting a large fanbase for fuck all reason. Not like you couldn't just continue making all types of stuff, did you not want to? Why the fuck make it in the first place then? And to satisfy these planks and your own ego. So yeah, it is pretty god damn FAKE when you think about it. Your whole youtube persona is fake, and that's the point. 

It's really a shame. I'm not too interested in you as a person because well, it's not my place, but being a sociopath isn't my cup of tea. I don't care if I know you or not, I care. I give a damn. So to see you be stretched apart by your fanbase, it's ridiculous.

You don't even attempt to understand the feelings of those who enjoyed the other music. Who felt the emotion from it. You don't care because you're mad. Because they, what, insulted your work? Think about it from anyone's point of view who isn't a complete fucking autistic pleb, half of your music literally sounds like a joke. Don't get me wrong, it's good and well structured, but like I said earlier, you just sound like you're trying to get a quick laugh. I enjoyed those other songs because they generate such a large contrast between your other personas. It was a really amazing thing and actually effected the impact 10x more. But you wouldn't understand that. Because the music you made under Joji, or PinkOmega, or whatever the fuck you want to call yourself, was actually the fake music.

Honestly, I'm glad you won't be touching that kind of music again. Your shitty hands would only ruin the genre.

You should know all about fake. You live it every day.
Suddenly the cinematic quality of Filthy Frank improved
Yo drop more shit actually like this shit goes
joji - onigiri?
I made some rice balls today, they were cold and flavourless, they reminded me of you, my day got a little better after that.
TBH, this is some fire.

This is in some strange way beautiful
„Åì„Çå„Åå„Åô„Åç„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„ÄÇ
wanna buy my mixtape?
But why would you rinse the starch off if you are making them into rice balls? You make no sense. You just make it harder for yourself.
Fire shit fam üî•üî•üî•
The way this music video starts, a repeating noise while a guy wearing pink smokes a cigarette in a bathtub. Also known as an analogy for my life.
RICE BALLS IN MY FACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Joji I Saw Your Dick Jiggle In Dat Suit Comin Out The Tub..üåö
Gimme da pussy boss
ive watched this at least 100+ times i can make rice balls without even thinking about it now
Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these

This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday" This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role mode;
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave

Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)

(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem
Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video at the same time, you know?
Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time.
pink Omega should run for sennate.
I want that Joji and Pink music hell yeah keep it going man you're fucking amazing
My life is now complete that he made a song about onigiri cx
I get the message. I think you are really talented and I appreciate what you do. I know it hurts to be this talented. I won't say please keep doing it; that would be selfish but as long as you choose to continue doing this, I am on your side.-fan
i need some pg if you know what i'm saying
appreciated
I ' m writing this with my penis
Love you papa
dope as fuck papa franku
Haha wonder how Ksi feels knowing a grown man who walks around in a pink suite shouting crap is better than him at rapping
He finally said it you crybabies.
what a shitty apartment
3:00 you know that it is the wrong way to smoke and eat at the same time...
This makes me question my rappin skills franku üòÄüî´
I was high when I made my name
this is actually so good
Clean your house
Today's lesson is... Don't smoke kids
You call Jojiboys out on creating a divide between "real" and "fake", but you specifically made that divide yourself, talking about how you were going to drop a #RealShit album and creating a new name (Pink Omega) for harder Pink Guy tracks. I remember back when you had to sit down and talk to us as George because the stress of maintaining the Franku persona was getting to you, and now you want to act like people are all expecting some special shit from you when you were just playing one straight line the whole time. The truth is that you weren't and that you created all these funny characters to fuck around with separate from other shit - now you want to pull the wool back over us and act like you're the court jester through and through.

I'm not disappointed in anything you're doing because what does it really matter in the end? It would be nice to have one album of serious shit, but you can do whatever the fuck you want. Make it, don't make it, it doesn't matter to me. Just know that acting like that divide never existed is pure fuccboi.
Guys this is actually a tutorial on how to make fire rice balls
What kind of camera do you use frank?
It actually sound so good. xD

He sounds basically identical to CollectivePOV
The thought that always crosses my mind when watching these videos......how does the house get cleaned?
Show of hands, who ended up here searching for an actual rice ball recipe? 

(._.)/
Bout to make rice balls for the first tike
aw he had a boner
I actually learned how to make rice, though its really fucking salty.
Hi Frank! I don't know if this is real or not. I have seen the "real" you. I have looked it up and it said re-uploaded. I have heard a time ago you had bad seizures. The video said your name is George and you're nickname is Joji. At the time you were 20 and you were a student at college. I am not trying to "expose" you. But I know you said it isn't going to put your life in danger. But, I am a new subscriber and I wanted to know if you were okay! :D
Low key lit

I swear this is some OFWGKTA kinda beat
i listen to this song to drown out my parents arguing. Your music makes me smile during this time when i know their devorce is enviable.
lob-lob-lobby--bby--lob!
Feeling an odd future vibe from this beat its dope
Frank you made me go insane and i dont know what to do with my life anymore
honest critique:

not as good as the old shit. this just sounds like an OF ripoff.
pink omega
how is pink guy only able to speak normally when he's rapping?
Wow. This is acually pretty awsome! Nice work Frank!
His raps are always dope as fuck.
whens the next chin chin sacrifice?
Let's all go to the lobby
O no b0ss u hab canser
ugh, its so fire but it makes me soo hungry
Holy crap, those first scenes are great. Franku is a great photographer
1:17 "I act retarded on stage."

This should tell those who didn't know yet that he actually ISNT crazy all the time it's just his 'character'.
Filthy beat I love it. No pun intended.....

The pun was intended nvm.
Are you Japanese?
crazy how good this shit is lol keep doing this shit man
Weldone George this was awesome
###############YYYYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That breakdown with the piano was so Odd Future
I don't even get why this is so good.
You deserve more subs.
im all yours, papi
2:24 Django Reference?
Ahahahaha awesome
This man may be the edgiest man on the interweebs
Pink guy is the new MACKELEMORE
when a youtuber's music doesn't actually suck.
fuck is Yoda voice at
this was the best song to end 2015
Nice beat.
where's the guy who commented the lyrics? :(
What a spiritual lyrical miraculous individual......
this shit is L                    I                    T
The ending of this song does concern me to an extent. Don't get me wrong I fucking love this and all of Frank's content, been a fan for the past 2-3 years dude. However I was first excited for the Joji album, then it got cancelled (or so I heard), and then there was PinkOmega with Trap Dumplings and it was gonna be the true start to "serious" music, but then the end of this song kinda hints like that's over. Is anyone else more educated on this? If so please do tell me what's going on. Either way keep up the amazing work frank, gonna fuck with you till I die b0ss.
keep up the good fucking work man
When the beat drops I'm like: ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) ( Õ°‚äô Õú ñ Õ°‚äô) ( Õ°‚óâ Õú ñ Õ°‚óâ)
Smoking is bad for your voice.





I don't care if you smoke honestly
just by watchimg this video,i learned how to make an onigiri :D
hey just watched you "filthy frank revels himself" vid somewhere deep in the internet. How come you haven't actually uploaded any vlogs to your jojivlogs channel?
im just gonna say it now but he is really cute in this vid
is it bad that i actually REALLY like this?
Bro do you even underwear?
this is fire
tfw Joji could make mad money off of his music.
Dude I actually like this song... Is this on Spotify? Lol if not it should be!!!
i played this in a csgo comp lobby and it was fire, also i got reported and banned for a month

I like your videos dude, but this is some of the most annoying, wanna-be edgy GARBAGE I've ever heard. Spend more time writing this shit.
I hope you guys know when you hate on Frank, your are just feeding his passion, so keep doing what you are doing, i like his videos.
Smoking is bad for you.
I plugged this shit in my subwoofer and my house fucking shook from the bass. I think the police are coming, soon.
Wat did u use for slow motion?
FilthyFrank, love your channel dude. I pass out due to excitement when i see a new video. Thanks for making my day. I hope that you stay healthy and safe, may sound kinda selfish but i wouldnt want my fav youtuber to leave :(

"We waNt rEal mUiC 
We wAnt joJI MusIc"
"Bro, i didn't know that real and fake music existed! It's your fault for putting it into category"
I see a bunch here swearing at the supporting coments; "because a true fan knows", "because a true fan can't act like a  actual fan with 'joji'" (but they actually won't demonstrate that only to please the guy at any rate) are you that concerned that some other dude is concerned?
bla bla.. horse shit. Get over yourselves
you're all fucking faggots
Is that really frank singing?
you're a pretty good cook i assume?
tyler the creator should sign him
Joji this was amazing keep being you :)
Joji this was amazing keep being you :)
George, honestly i want to thank you for making such good shit, and honestly fuck anyone who just hates and is cancerous. I really love your videos and would love to see an actual "George" video instead of a "Frank" video. keep up the good shit eitherway you sexy fuck
This music is fire.
Joji I just wanna say that please put your health in front of your youtube channel. I'm not talking about your smoking I'm referring to your other health problems. please from a real fan take care of yourself.

A lot of you game assassins seem to think skill alone is gonna get into the victory lane as you go leaping from level to level, room to room, and world to world, With little or no effort.  Ohhhhhhhh planet rangers

I like balls

i fucking love this, why cant i find it on spoofy?
I'm a young orphan, and I can't stand all the other music that my generation play. I mean, these other two year olds don't have any taste in real music. I love Mr. Priest

Please like me
Good to know that Frank isn't gonna take stupid shit from his fans.
I hate black people 





JK its just a prank bro
when u realize frank looks like a weeb himself in real life
it makes me uncomfortable when he wears that pink suit
"Im here to be an act not a role model" i dont mind ^_^
what synthesizer do you use? (If it even is one.)
Good stuff man
nicee
I just sorta listen to this while walk around my house and do stuff, i actually like this song
That was so AMAZING that I had to watch it TWICE!
Frank is Dank
This is actually a sick ass beat. Something along the lines of ERB.
You are spitting too much fire. You might burn those „Åä„Å´„Åé„Çäs.

Lyrics?
Everyone who brought their inconvenient shit with them should shut the fuck up already. I don't understand why this shit is more controversial than it needs to be. Nothing's changed, really... FilthyFrank still uploads the same kind of stuff; and people still yapping about how sad they are on this channel. It's not your channel, if you don't like what you see, get the fuck out instead of complaining about the channel/video/fanbase like a spoiled child.
He makes great music, like he said music is music.
Broh, u are growing a Neckbeard!
give me your cummies dad
Papa franku when I first saw one of your episodes I was like WTF XD it was the kill yourself song. I was like WTF is up until I was like OK I subscribed and stuck with you. your a very a interesting channel and usually makes me laugh. keep up the work
earl
i was born in the wrong generation lol :P i guess
This song is so catchy, it's been stuck in my head for like a week, help
You got triggered by TheFandomMenace.
feels nice actually getting the references... or am i? orca ninjas?
Sad that no one's acctually listening to the lyrics.
still better than KSI
Sounded like something that OF would make specifically Tyler and Earl, Earl beat and Tyler on the mic.
Made on my birth day
We don't only eat rice. We also eat Pumba from the Lion King for Christmas.
Better than Meek Mill tbh
dank
Papa franku spittin that fire nobody else could ever get on their shit mixtapes
Just do you Boo Boo. 




Just don't stop posting or else I'll have to start cutting again...
He produced and rapped on this? Damn, he's really good!

Legend says that the pink guy who ravages the streets, settles down when making his meal and spits the hottest fire, then repeats the cycle...      - Morgan Freeman
Who else knew that he used the "let's all go to the lobby" sample when he first released this beat on the Pink Guy album?
Why the fuck do Joji fans even still exist Jesus Christ.
does papa franku actually smoke? just curious.
Make your songs available on iTunes
Man you need to clean that oven top.
Read a lot of the comments, honestly it's scary when some YouTubers get to a point where they can't really be.. well themselves really, when it gets to an extent that a person's (as someone said, twin personality) overtakes their actual image it's beyond too much. Whether or not there's a hidden meaning or some shit behind this song is besides the point, sometimes audiences need to realize that entertainers are human just like the rest of you. Damn, I came here just to enjoy and laugh at stupid shit but to read the comments.. makes me sad man.
Instrumental?????
I'd listen to him if he became a legit rapper with a label and stuff
his good
This is my music.
I'm a miracle spiritual lyrical individual...
Tojo called, he said he wished he would have keep the war going so the Americans would have dropped another bomb.
HOLY SHIT THIS NIGGA IS FILTHY AS FUCK
White version of Tyler the creator
smoking? good boy image gone :///
what even was this and why the fuck is he making rice
Man, it really wears people down to have a twin personality like that, holy shit.
Joji is actually a really good artist and those asking for him to make Joji music  he is,and I still can't believe he's been doing this for 9 years I've always loved his music and I'm happy he can still make music on this channel and on soundcloud it's amazing the person who is behind all these characters is actually really talented so for those being a bitch and asking for Joji music here it is.
1:13 holy shit I need this chill beat...
i'd really like to hear more music from him
i think that in this video he is 100% himself, the man behind filthy frank
He would become so successful as a rapper
U should collab with FrankJavCee for something musical niggo
fr right now this shit fire üî•üíØ
where are the lyrichs?
I really dislike his videos that have other youtubers in it. I want his videos where he talks about a controversial topic and makes fun of it.
Legit good song
322
I would buy this on iTunes or any shitty remake.
we want real music
So this is basically a new ad for a new camera. Name the camera on demonstration please? Fkin beautiful.

My respect for Papa Franku has risen over level 9,000.
Lyrics m8's:
Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these

[Verse 2]
This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

[Interlude]
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 3]
I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday" This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role mode;
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave

Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)

[Outro]
(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem
Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video at the same time, you know?
Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time
damn 50 shades of pink guy
ur kitchen looks clean
I keep cuming (back) to these sick rhymes
lob lob lob bby the best background track for a rap song iv ever heard - vlad approves
im one of his older fans.. I always jizz on his videos with my wife.
Papa pls stop smoking. You'll get addicted and die. PLEASE FATHER
Straight fucking fire
If he ever goes big with his music I hope he doesn't forget about us.
Every comment in every Filthy Frank video is from someone trying to be "edgier" than the other dudes.
never change
his voice is incredibly attractive
your house looks like a radioactive wasteland
this is real music
I want to try some of Pink Guy's food... He seems like an excellent... CHEF
where can I buy this song?
I want Pink guy to be my daddy ;)
Husband wanna fuck, but he gotta wait cause I'm watchin' Papa Franku
ur mixtape is fire m8
Donald Trump or Kanye for president?
He has a smexy voice,lol
You gotta give it to him, he makes catchy music
made me stop cutting
rap with jazzy paino riffs/parts is what i live for.
why cats? those vlogs were great. pls continue with Chloe Burbank though, it sounds great so far.
I would legit go to a concert if Papa ever decided to go on tour.
I want to clean your house
Is it weird that I actually really like this song? Lol
Don't care whether it's real music or not, whatever that means. I just want more of it :D
Can I get some lyrics?

so many edgy kids in the comments KIIIIILLLLLLL MEEEEE11!!1!!1!!111!1!1!!!
I've realized that you have a great head on your shoulders. You have the ability to do a lot of things that most people would never get close to doing. Kudos to you!
the white/asian tyler the creator. i love it
you know this dude is really asian when he makes rice in a saucepan and not a rice maker.
Just dont get caught by the police so you can make these.
Is this Frank's shitty mixtape he told us about?
Better than WettyFap
I know this wasn't  supposed to be a real rap song but fuck me in the ass, shit is fire.
Tyler is that you?
10/10 Tutorial, now i can make my own.
Didnt he hate people that do mixtapes?

GEORGE MILLER I FUCKING KNO WHO U R MUDDA FUCKR IM COMING FOR UR ASS
I'm a music person, and I think this is genuinely pretty cool. Reminds me of Earl Sweatshirt's song "Whoa".
"WhatEverTheFuckYouWannaCallMe" is the most multi-talented person on the internet.
2:23 when you blaze weed m9
what are you, some sort of faggot?
This is fucking fire üî•üî• I've been listening to this song on repeat XDD
love you pick omega, you real nigga~
The more subscribers Frank gets; the more fucking cancerous his fan-base gets.
1.25 speed and be happy
Hero. Never stop doing you, man.
I feel that at 2:37 we get a glimpse of the real man behind FilthyFrank, which I love.
Gotta be one of his best songs
1:24 - 1:35 is good
That's a Filthy House
papa can you stick that cigarette down my dick
you remind me of tyler the creator
BrRRRRRRR
fuking dank
song download?
Joji's flow reminds me of Mac Miller. Post-WMWTSO Mac Miller though.
Damn papa franku dat gotee sexy
This was amaze.

tenk u papa
Filthy Frank has become pretty degenerate since he started smoking cigarettes.
This is seriously really fucking good
cook meth next
God, have I been living under a fucking rock? This shitty autistic fanbase is more cancerous than ever but still papa franku still makes the effort to put out decent videos.

Pink Guy + Tyler the Creator = best ironic music bomb ever made...
Da fuck are we waiting for? Bring Wolf's ass down here and start the nukin' yall
Honestly preach it, you're completely right about everyone who divides silly shit and serious shit, just mix it together for a nice melting pot of filthy fucking frank. Music is music, comedy is comedy, but art is fucking art.
When's your mixtape gunna drop Frank?
I have learned to cook from his music videos
The fact that Joji isn't famous for his music amazes me, shits üî•
Instrumental pls?
I bet he's being honest
" I act retarded on stage then put my finger's in pusses, like uh "
This is so similar to Tyler, The Creator. I'm kinda digging this.
you the best
Frank your music is actually fucking good.

What's the point in this song, not hating just really ignorant. lmao.
i would pay 200 to see you live no joke
Do you have a pusi lair? There must be a way you come up with this music.
I'm a 17 year old who enjoys listening to filthy frank rap
Fucking Christ...
the part of beat that comes in when he starts his first verse is the same beat he used in the intro of rat chef when he was showing the pigeon isn't it?
THIS SHIT IS ACTUALLY HOT WHAT THE FUCK
nice!! but I want to clean your apartment >.<
yesterday...

i made some riceballs ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
he looks so much like leonard from the big bang theory haha
Haha I loved this, I want to buy it
suicide is a solution
i watch porn on my 3ds
this has a bit of a Tyler vibe to it
Idiots still don't realise the meaning of this song do they? 
HE'S FUCKING SICK OF THE RETATDED ASSHOLES RUINING HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL!!!
Listen to the lyrics you retarded 4Chan fuckers!
fucking legend
This one has to be my favorite so far though.
To be honest, I'd pay for a serious rap album by Frank.

Good beats.

Smooth flow.

And a voice to match.
It's funny; You act as if being serious, and not being whatever these heavy breathing douche bags from 4chan tell you to be, is impossible. Your content used to be funny as shit, and creative. Now? It's as if you only do shit that'll give 4channers a hard-on. I saw your personal video, the one you had to take down thanks to your " fans "? I hope you're doing alright, considering you're not even aloud to say if you or aren't. I honestly feel bad for you, because you don't get any breathing space. If you were to have a facebook profile JUST for family and friends? People like your " fans " would stalk you down, and fuck everything up. You'd probably be fucking amazing at making serious shit, but i'll guess we'll never know. You have talent, that you'd rather exploit by making 13-17 year old boys giggle about, than use it on things you'd actually genuinely enjoy. Again, might as well just ditch " FilthyFrank ", and call yourself " Papa 4chan ". Because that's all you are, now. How old are you now? 21? 22? Great path ahead of you, man. Really.
Is this what 2016 is gonna be like? OMG amazing
For real, Filthy Frank, George, Pink Guy/omega, whatever bruh wants to call himself, dude has hella talent. A style all his own. Oddly enough, some of his shit reminds me of MF DOOM. Ill asf.
What is the meaning about the video?
filthy frank makein some fire ass beats!
low key kinda lit
Why won't people give him his own tv show! To me he is more funny than Family Guy!

duuuude this is fire and the beat is A1
..theres always meaning behind these shit videos of yours.
Damn Frank. Love the new shit mate. 8/8 its better than the old.
Yo man it would sick if you released this beat.
The only balls I would touch from frank (except his other balls)
sounds like something tyler would make
I've watched this so many times that my brain is made out of Rice Balls.
I love how this guy gets more views than Drake
another good rap George
another good rap George
English. Sorry for my Hi.
Resipee not clear enouf, riece ball stuk in penis.
*ovaries destroyed*
What is up with this bass?!?!?!
If you like Pink Guy's style, check out Cool Calm Pete.

They're VERY similar. Dope punchlines and dope beats.
JOJI ON FIRE. :D
DAMN.
THATS THE CLOTHES WHAT HE USED IN THE FIRST HARLEM SHAKE ON THE WORLD!!
His fanbase is filled with a bunch of autistic memesters that really don't understand what he is going through in his real life one of the reason he took down that video of him being himself because he probably knows his fanbase wouldn't understand what his is trying to say because they only come here to see him do completely weird shit which is fine but when they see change they instantly go "Fuck this Faggot go kill yourself" bunch of fucking inbreds.
..... a tutorial on a delicious recipe while making a funny music video. So you get two vids in one. Thanks tvfilthyfrank!
your songs are fucking awesome
this shit  is the shit like your shitty aparment lowkey jealous
what does he use to make the beats?
I like this, just disliking for thousandth dislike
Thank you for the tutorial on making rice balls. Mine turned out pretty good

This song is so good I don't even know. It has sick beat, some great rapping and it's basically an ear worm. I love this shit
It's focked bra

In the memetime...
i fucking love this shit anime
the next music should be Filthy God
at making the vids but not life
he is awesome
stup up- don't listen to him frank
i'll fuck u with the radiator pipe nyes
joji the best
I've noticed that lately, since his first attempt to make it on to the show and into the FF universe as himself, Joji has been using other channels such as TheNeedleDrop and MaxMoeFoe to show his real person to YouTube instead of FilthyFrank. Which I think is a great idea; he shouldn't feel like he has to totally hide himself from the public and appear on other channels only in character. If he's doing something with Max or iDubbz or something, he's Joji, and not Frank, and it's annoying as fuck when you see people commenting "ey b0ss" and shit on videos he's in with other people as himself.
I actually like this alot
this song actually has a really good beat
His word flow still amazes me. Dude knows music.
Was that B-MO?
I need an instrumental
RIP David Bowie.
HOLY SSSSHHHHHHHHHHIIIT 60FPS
Idubbbz is racist as fuck...
My entire life is a prank
Is his a hint at a new pink guy album
You can straight up see his dick
onigiri! Son!
I bet that apartment smells RANK.
FUCK IT UP JOJI YESSSS your voice is actually super soothing to my ears, thIs is amazing!!
When filthy frank is just exposing the shit side of media. That's why it's ass to show it. Baws
I was watching this vid and forgot to wipe my ass in the bathroom
Anime is cancer

NO HE CAUGHT THE INTERNET RAPPER DIESEASE

if you listened  to the lyrics it's deep asf
Be a middle class straight white Christian male. Or fuck you and our rice balls.

Frank, keep those sunglasses. You look bitchin' in 'em.
The one channel with active subs
Camera?
this is real music, none of that gay Bieber and Dubshit.

is it just me or does this sound like it could be a Tyler the Creator song?¬ø
Why do you smoke
hey frank just want to say your production skills are really good, i listen to a lot of edm and i have to say, this beat is sick!!
Fake and gay.
Why you change the title? Feeling insecure about your choices?
üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
john lennon aint dead...

Download link??
I think when Frank raps that is his real voice
I want the link to this song
#PapaFrankuDidChernobyl
Oh so you're fighting my dad in the parking lot huh?
He's better then slim Jesus
[Lyrics]:
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these

[Verse 2]
This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

[Interlude]
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 3]
I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday" This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role mode;
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave

Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)

[Outro]
(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem
Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video at the same time, you know?
Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time
You should hit up Tyler the creator, you guys are similar
also whens the sacrafice at
aw fuck my grammer

Mixtape  Fire on hotter fire ‚ô®üî•üî•üî•üî•

thanks pink papa
Cooking with pink guy
holy shit, he's buff as fuck now
1:11 sounds like Analog 2 - Odd Future. Actually this whole song sounds like OF.
You smoke ?!? You just lost all respect for me.
where is they itunsese plz bouss.
@##@damn this is a dank beat
~~~~
I try to get my friends to listen to this but they can't get through one minute before changing it
This is kind of dope
I find it pretty odd that there are so many comments saying "OMFG SU SAD BRING JOJIVLOGS BACK WE WANT DE REEL JOJI PL0X DA FANBAAS SUXXX!!!!!11"

He specifically makes fun of the fags that beg for Joji. The comments you guys type talk about Joji like he's suicidal, saying "itz so sed how da fanz supres joji". He isn't pressured into these characters, he fucking loves it. The only thing that annoys him are the faggots that are dangerously obsessed with his personal life.
Why is Kripparrian  on this channel?
Your real voice sounds so good when you're rapping
1:12 Denfitly my life explained in a filthy frank song
He's a in a different kitchen. He must of finally got kicked out of his apartment. I would of joined him and snorted line of Ajax just like his mini pony.
This guy is seriously a genius subscribing to him was the best decision of my entire life
Jojis production is god tier...
flames...
Papa Franku's mix tape is fire
this bass do
does he actually smoke though?
Since when did PinkGuy have a neckbeard?
Oh yeah fucking rice balls. Still not better than pussy boss.

Bring back johnsonblos!
I found this instruction video pretty usefull. 9/10
damn almost 100k likes
Bruh I love how his apartment is just as gross and cramped and nasty as his characters. Adds to the authenticity of the whole FF universe if you get me.
this legit sounds good hahaha
this cinematography is pretty fucking cool
cum to brazil

THANK YOU FRANK ! just made this in my family gathering..they LOVED it....well, untill grandma found tabacco in her ball
1:11 That actually sounds sooo banging. O_O Frankuuuu ~ Seriously though, fav part. Someone loop that :D

This is actually pretty good
What happened to george
What is the tempo on this beat?
That's pretty gay mate.
its cool that you even produce your own beats. when I first saw your videos I would have never known you were so talented
Love the song man.
Franks apartment sucks dick. Poor ass motherfucker
Have to admit that this is a pretty sick beat.
I don't mean to be THAT guy, but I think at least a few people who say they want "real" music mean that they want music focusing on more serious topics rather than funny music. I personally don't give a shit either way, I like anything Frank puts out, really. I do also think those who think that this isn't "real" music are fucking retarded, real talk, this shit is fire.
Sooo when does this come out on vinyl?
I can fap to this
this is actually not bad
Damn the filthy frank channel has attracted a lot of normies.
has a tyler, the creator vibe
WE WANT A PINK GUY/PAPA  FRANKU WORLD TOUR!!!
I'm glad that he finally made a song with the "bleep blop" beat. This is one of my favourites.
I love you franku <3
Does Franky actually smoke, or does he just do it for his videos?
wasted talent??
"I'm here to be an act, not a role model"- the point of this song, don't take fithy Frank seriously.
SO NOW YOU ARE AN INTERNET RAPPER
O¬† u made my recipe ?
divinely!!!!
there is no difference between real music and fake music. stop annoying joji and let him do what he fucking wants to do
OMG, I CAN'T FUCKING STOP WATCHING THIS VIDEO

So Pink Omega is Pink guy now? And also dead? D: I liked Pink Omega, it was like an extension of music for him.

If you're enjoying this cancer then check out my tumor channel
Nah. Excuse my bluntness, im a few beers in. If your post is truly a reflection of your adult views, then you are a fool. Of course everything seemed better in your childhood/adolescent innocence, you didn't know anything about the world. You grew up a bit, and you lost that innocence. That's why, comparatively, everything seems worse now than it was in 2006. You're growing up and confronting reality with a more mature and realistic minset, your brain is more developed too. The universe didn't suddenly decide to get shitty, that's silly. The world isn't any shittier now than its always been. You're just smarter than you were before but evidently, not self aware enough to realize that.
Papa Franku has inspired me to shoot up my school üòåüòò
There is a meaningful message in this rap but i cant put my finger on it
filthy frank needs a record label.  he is a amazing rapper.
When are you going to make a Spotify album?
Seriously, this is good shit xD
Man, you have a talent for rapping, but u waste it on wierd stuff XD
Refreshing to hear Frank's admin's voice <33
8 more facts or the world of tumor will be free
Cinematography looks nice.
This is actually artistic.  But it's still so fucking absurd.  "Who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary video at the same time?" wtf i love this.

Start a #filthyfrankworldtour trend
When frank is a better rapper and composer than majority of today's mainstream hip-hop artists.
you should put this on Spotify
Oh god now its on 60 fps to see the filth more clearly

He is just as good as Tyler the creator
Parts of the beat kinda sound like jdilla - feel this shit.
Funny how hes better than most of the mainstream rappers
You need to make more videos in 720p60 FRANKUUUU
1:13 reminds me of Tyler
1:34 how tf those bottles didnt break?
This is actually fucking fire
im kinda confused... pink guy isn't frank right?
0:25 you can see the rest of the riceball senpai throws at the end of the video xD
Am I the only one that enjoys franks music? I know it's dumb but it acc sounds aight.
George4lyfe
YES
How did he make this? Like how can I do that stuff with the audio
When you're looking for advices about making rice balls in YouTube and this comes first. Pink suited asian guy in a bathtub smoking cig and playing keyboard. Neat!
that slo mo takes it to the next level.
Lets all go to the lobby

I need these instrumentals..
I'm starting to worry about jojis health since he's been doing kush and smoking

This beat is so fucking sick.
Frank i have  a question,have you ever got laid?
when is it getting on spotify m8?
yo i get that ur just in this for publicity, but ur alright at rapping and making beats, u could probably make alot of views. 
And keep the video the same. At least u could say its art. Not sick stuff like eating pubic hair inna cake..
small dick lol
+1 to that cinematography Franku
No point in keeping your fetishes a secret anymore. Share with me my children.
1:08-1:30
Franks actually needs to do concerts. Fuck, I'd go man
Do you actually smoke Frank?
Papa Franku/Pink Guy how'd you learn to make beats, and how could a guy learn?

Every single time I watch a Filthy Frank vid I feel like I need a shower.
You need a rice cooker tbh
I was born in the wrong generation. Like even though he's messing around it STILL sounds better then what stupid 17 year olds listen too this day and age. LOL
an original YouTuber. actual comedy, fire lyrics bro
Oh shit the song from PINK GUY DANCE that was made 3 years ago nice
Where did you get the production value to make this? Cause this shit not only sounds boss like it always does, but the video quality is really top notch.
Why did I feel a Logic sort of vibe??
Reminds me of Tyler the creator üòÇ
lmao these instrumentals are like every logic song ever
I'M 25 and I LIKE THIS MUSIC, SAYS A LOT ABOUT MY GENERATION HUH?!
pink omeguy has filthy feet
this needs to be on i tunes NOW!!!
Video quality keeps getting better bruh
the description is true, thanks papa franku for being that classic og dizasta music type shit y'know what I'm sayin'?
I had a dream that filthy frank made a video where he goes to his high school reunion and his high school is a dimension that's  basically a sterotypical high school with sterotypical fag kids but frank goes on the wrong day and  ends up doing a whole day of high school  so I tried looking for that video but found this lol
is this his real voice?
Now i'm actually worried about George Miller 100% after watching his videos of his ego...
aw yis
We want joji music XD .... idk why i find myself repeating that part but its pretty funny
Keep up the good work frank and keep doin what your doin :-)

Reminds me of Tyler the creator

That's a phat beat man.
Listening to this with Beats Studios, the ones with Monster, not the shit they make today. And the bass absolutely melts my ears.
Man that's White odd future 
Like it
What does it feel like to get a million views on a video? it must feel crazy. surreal as hell like " I'm me and literally a million people payed attention to me". shit is nuts.
I want the instrumental
I got a Tyler the Creator vibe from this song, it's too fire. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

I feel like filthy frank is dying. Too many rap videos, the latest videos just makes him look like some kind of fuckboy or faggot. I miss the goold old times when he just fucked with shit in his pink guy costume his perfect pedophile face, The gay music playing in the back round and shaman. Good old fucking shaman.
was looking at the dick print the whole time...

The Dick Print should be his new album name
rice balls  FEEL MY NICE BALLS
whoever dosnt like this probs has sickel cell
I love this show, most original content on yt
papa Franku pls :*
I have just seen your video bc my friend is a lunatic and she told me to watch. I find this video very interesting and I would like to say that the rice balls would taste better with some seasoning as I am a professional cook. Thank you and I hope you take my commentary to heart and make a new video with new rice balls
I think FF should do something about DJ Khaled
ey b0ss is jojivologs real franku sempai?

Amazing beat.
Now I have a proper use for my repeat button
Filthy Frank is gonna tour with Odd Future one day lmao
ur the boss
I would fu ck filthy frank. literally.
I thought it was a 360 video at the start
One day, I'll have a conversation with this person. The results will be utterly salubrious. Here's some coffee shop poetry I've been working on;

Cabbage! How ghastly that dongle looked, huddled in the corner. "Slap an orangutan", she uttered. Eureka! Seven dollars. The letterbug says hello, young kindle. I'm speaking to the real head now. Come slump on the gizzard! Five fingers mean you have to clap for the happy boy dinner.

Goodnight.
So when are you and dunkey gonna collab
üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Basically Franks way of saying "No Joji album".
This cancerously good song will be the end of me
I;m thinking about Thos riceballs
–¢–∞–∫–æ–π –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π. –¢–∞–∫–æ–π –≥–ª—É–ø—ã–π
How does George still have the brain cells to this? I would have gotten autism. Props for George for doing these videos
the bari sax was fucking rad
I actually learnt something today
i saw papa franku in my dream last night
it was beautiful
What the fuck, Frank that last line. STRAIGHT MOTHERFUCKING KNOWLEDGE.
What happened to Onigiri?
did he really smoke..........while eating........wtf ewww
JOJI PLEASE COME BACK
you posted on me birthday
He's genuinely talented....
Recipe not clear enough; got dick stuck in rice ball.
He looks like Tingle from Legend of Zelda with that goatee
How many dicks have you had to suck to make your voice sound like that?
lmao those bathtub shots got ppl thinking your kohh in it g ma
Papa frankus channal has inspired me to get off my ass and go to school... Then take out an m16 and FUCKING KILL EVERYONE INCLUDING MYSELF CAUSE HUMANITY IS FUCKING DONE. IF THERE ARE ANY ALIENS OUT THERE PLZ TAKE ME TO YOUR PLANET LET ME BECOME ONE WITH YOUR PEOPLE..... plz...
Maldito loco de mierda!.. loved it!
guys remember we need to protect papa franku from the little kid and the teen faggots from pewdiepies channel ok we need to put aside the meme wars and stand together to protect papa franku! if you so a furfag,emo,bronie or any other type of cancer please write a short rant and tell them to fuck off and to kill them selves! please post this on papas frankus videos so others can know
Those are some top notch culinary skills. You must've seen chef.
we don't want joji music. we want frank back.  the old frank we fell in love woth
we all ruv u joji. 2homo4me but srs b0ss
frank is daddy af
I remember when he dropped this beat on his vine, I fucking beat my dick to it on nine separate occasions
now you are the chef
Can someone explain why he makes these types of music videos. The content is not absurd or filthy, he just seems like a dick. Unless he's making fun of dicks who have the "dont give a fuck attitude". Its cool music, but it seems like a waste.
This reminds me of old Dumbfoundead days.
eyyyy b0ss, can i habe de beat pls?
fuck this is good.
Papo I'm worried about ur health my nigga.
what voice/sound is he sampling at 1:24 ?
Your music is amazing all your vids are funny as hell. It's funny when people try to hate.
this makes my scrotum wet.
I love you George!!!
911 dislikes, seems legit
I can't stop watching this
+TVFilthyFrank i challenge you to eat your own shit
@TVFilthyFrank i challenge you to eat your own shit
this sounds like Tyler the creator
the beat wasn't cancerous enough
you should do a collab with brandon rogers
Three sword style
Raps better than KSI...
1:24 Isn't that BMO saying "Finn" ?
Can we all take a second to realize that George made this channel and specifically says frank is an image no one should be. Props George you're one of the realist guys out here. Btw your music makes me jizz in my pants
Back when I was 9 years old my uncle violated me. He touched me. One night, after my soccer game, he pulled my pants down and covered my mouth before I could scream or yell , he whispered right into my ear " my name is chef." I want to kill myself everyday because of this.
why is everyone asking if he is unhealthy
Lets get some pussy tonight
What camera does he use in this video, it looks great
i remember back when franku slipped in his pink guy suit. he's mastered the art of lycra
The partial beard looks nice on u frank.
filthy frank is honestly one of my favorite rappers
Edit: rather reading hate comments.
Ok is your name frank,Jorge M√ºller  or george miller i know your going to make a joke about it if u do a reading your comments video so just make the joke and get it over with. Ok now that is behind us after the joke and all if u feel comfortable telling us your real name. p.s trying not to be a creeper.
baaarsssss
papa always comes through with some nice jams
If only your fanbase wasn't so stupid.
This beat is orgasmic
WOW. First PewDiePie does a reaction video off of your video but now he is completely copying your channel! he just posted a loser reads hate comments video. How can you stand for this Frank?
can we get just the instrumental cuz that shit's fire mc fire too
"Still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed"
That's why I love this guy
nooo not the rice!!!
Best porn video of 2015-A small moan of a million dollars.Staring Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka
Voc√™ brinca com o alimento?
finally bleep blop has been rapped over?
Let me rephrase. If you want to keep doing filthy frank then do what makes you happy. If you want to keep making 'joji' music then do whatever you want. Whatever makes you happy then do it. I love your videos. I'm sorry that a lot of your 'fans' bombard you with REAL MUSIC WE WANT REAL MUSIC. You know just let the guy be. If he enjoys being Frank let him be Frank. Be grateful because he does it for all you guys I hope you know that.
Lmao I hate the filthy frank 'fandom' , but frank himself and all his characters are gr8. His music is real good as well :^)
filthyfrank will forever be my spirit animal. love filthy frank so much.
Who does the production though, ohmagod.


oh wait. nvm. You genius, frank.
Can you make a instrumental version of this song
can we have instrumental ?
George actually drops some really nice shit. This video is kind of a message from him saying that he's pursuing his music career through his already very popular cancer/autism channel. Sneaky and smart papa.
who thinks joji should make a channel where he makes vlogs,Q&As,etc
scishow brought me here
this beat is fucking Flames
900 dislikes exactly.   Illuminati confirmed
Where the instrumental @ üôèüèø
not gonna lie I really dig this weirdo
"Upper echelon" also lyrics used in backpackers by childish gambino
This has to be art somehow.
wait, i know im gonna get criticised for this, but is this his actual voive or is the scratchy voice his actual one?
This is the best thing I have ever seen in my entire life.
Nice chin pubes...go shave!
Papa Franku, smoking is fucking bad!
where can I find this suit? need to make a nice impression on my gf's parents
this is probably your best song yet
Cory in the house is an anime
No lie though this was a good beat and his rapping was pretty good, best part was probably 
"Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve
Not to mention that we harder than viagra with a big cock" straight up bars
I think you should rebrand, You know kinda stray away from trying to weird people out to actually making people think, Ya feel?
This song makes my dank dick hard
This song is Too damn good
The fuckin editing and filming on this is amazing, I'm surprised no one has mentioned the perfect variation between slo-mo and regular pace. Well done
The mirage you cast is unfathomable, and It has just recently presented itself to me. I wish I could meet such a bright person like you in real life
world tour 

https://www.change.org/p/tvfilthyfrank-papa-franku-world-tour?recruiter=459675034&utm_source=share_for_starters&utm_medium=copyLink
Fuck you Frank.

Because of you my channel doesn't get any attention.
Fuck you. You're filthy.
at for your next vid you should react to the cringe fan art of you on deviant art.  it's bad.
i wanna fuck an 90 year old lady..:)
I want your weed
Mira macho, os teus v√≠deos moi ben, pero.... e a gracia?

Sweet beats.

I love weed I inject 3 daily
Some of the things he says just reminds me that he is a really smart guy... I would like to chat with him.
What are you fucking gay?
The "emotional moment" sounds alike some Tyler the Creator sounds , that's a cool inspiration !
ey yo, which ukulele should I get.
thank fucks.
We need 2015 recap
A new year, and someone will be around in the near future expecting some sacrifices... better be ready chromosomes.
lets all go to the BLAAP BLEEP
The beat sounds like the one at the start of the human ramen video
that beat was phat make more shit like this! had me boppin
Nice job
I thought Pink Guy wasn't Pink Omega
puts weed in filthy franku's goodie bag here u go timmy something to have fun with
pink guy is a pro

fuck you filthy Frank Frank your a fucking
My mum told me if i didn't turn the music down she would smash my face into the keyfebwhialeobigersujy4tawzs
Frank you're getting popular again. Fuck's sake dude not again, it's like the harlem shake immigration all over again. Cancerous pieces of shit trying to get into this shit and ruining it because they're fucking cringe.
For people who dont know his real voice, this is the perfect video. When he talks about the people complaining about real or fake music, it's his real voice.
iemand hier door Acid? ;)
Amazingly the video starts at 0:00 but the thing that most people don't understand is that the video ends at 03:23
frank can u do a blowjob video with gay friends gg
holy fuck but the end is real as fuck he's completely correct.
I have studied Filthy Frank's dick at about 0:18 and I can conclude that when unerected, his dick goes in at about 3 inches and 1.5 inches in diameter. It has a large head and about 253 hairs.
Yo Filthy Frank! Get your ass over to VidCon 2016! Google it, all us fans want to see you their! If you can't afford a Creator pass and all the other shit you need, start a Indiegogo, i'm sure we'll pay for your shit (Offer to meet up with fans for $$$ and shit like that) If you Want to see FilthyFrank at Vidcon 2016 Like this comment so he sees it!
Legend.

nice song faggot
This beat is hard as fuck tbh, such a kendrick lamar sounding beat too, love it
FRANK I AM SO PROUD OF YOU I think at this point we can see that Frank is kinda going away from the comedy side of thing and becoming more serious, a rapper is his calling from what I can see, this beat is fucking phat so I congratulate you
This a dope ass earl sweatshirt type beat
Guys guys. Lte's go to the lobby. What do you say'

salamander man? where is he? dead? question?
this show is so sick and weird but so funny at the same time
Pink Guy world tour pls m8
Hey joji, do you have the stems for the beat? Would you be willing to sell those?
Reminds me of Tyler the Creator, dope beat m9
I listen this when I eat breakfast
franku is the offspring of nujabes and kendrick
Someone know the beat name of the second part? This piano so fucking gud.
"I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh

Oh
Oh, yo"
Best flow brah

Whats the difference between animal abuse and domestic abuse? - domestic abuse is funny
Love your song
Bro your actually really talented, very retarded also but talented.
I feel bad that he had to make this video to get people to vaguely get it if they even listen to the lyrics 
But as always twas fire so idc
Inspirational.
100/10 cx IGN lol
frank, fuck all those fucking little kids dude. keep it real, and do the shit you wanna do. you are the new jackass with actual talent.
I watched this while pissing, i missed the toilet and used the dog to wipe it up as usual
I watched this while pissing, i missed the toilet and used the dog to wipe it up as usual
You should create your own music channel! :D
xDD

Joji used a 50's Coca Cola commercial as a rap beat.
Beauty.

You need to make a video on league of legends players
Dude I swear to god Franku could be in a song with Tyler the Creator Easy
Super late but that was fucking beautiful. üòÇüçô
TOP
I sometimes listen to franks raps after i've masturbated..
hey guys, remember when filthy frank's fan base wasn't infested by 16 year old edgy meme fags? i remember too.
i once saw one direction live.
don't smoke i don't wanna see you die :(
Filthy frank or whatever is real fucking name is, is defenatly getting tired of doing this stupid shit that all these twelve tear olds love so much that he's probably going to quit YouTube some time in the near future
cool story bro, changed my life, 9/11 needs more dinosaurs otherwise you'd get a full 5/7
primo
tyler is that you
He should do a q&a I want to know more about this thing

You need a fucking can opener
this sum hardcore !!!!!!,
I watch this daily.
Shit I love this dudes cancerous music
Nice job, this channel has well produced content despite how dedicated some of the fans can be. Most definitely a channel to be excited to see a new video on.
<3
This beat is some flames
Anyone else notice the rice on the window at the beginning of the video lol.
i cannot belive this guy hasn't found out who furries are
We get it, you vape
Listen, "Frank", I don't care what these "fans" have to say, if they don't want you to be yourself and to let them know you are a real person, then they aren't real fans. If you are unhealthy from this situation of your fans only wanting "Frank" and "Pink guy" then they don't deserve "Frank" and "Pink guy". If your health gets bad, and they don't care, if something happens to you, they don't realize, they will lose "Frank" and "Pink guy" as well. So for your health, if those "fans" don care about you, then they aren't fans, just haters, and fakes, fuck them, and don't acknowledge them or anything, your real fans will stick with you, and if those fake fan parasites leave, then that's better, so please, don't be afraid, put yourself out there, be yourself, not just for us, but for you, your health, and your family and friends.
This song is actually fire
This song is actually fire 
It was pretty cool hearing filthyFranks real voice for the first time too. Keep shit like this up Frank.
This song is actually fire

this IS REAL MUSIC LOLZ
Bruh! dat goatee tho
THIS BEAT IS FUCKING HOTTTTTT
haters if you dont like frank then dont watch the vid because he is just tryin to bein funny and dont hate.
Has Pink Guy (the character) gained intelligence?
You should make a personal channel, where you do vlogs (blogs?) and just less stressful  things in general. Your characters seem to take a toll on you. :^)
nice video Joji
I love you never stop pls b0ss
it's just a prank bro
Could someone tell me what's going on because I.know his channel is funky but I see the comments saying something is going on some ppl don't know
I'm glad to see pink guy still alive and kicking, I'm also anticipating the Chin Chin sacrifices.
BUY MY MIXTAPE
Do you mean jelly filled doughnuts?
Filthy Frank √© baile de favela
Can someone please make a gif of 1:54 when he raises his eyebrows üòÇ
No one will see this comment.

IT'S JUST A PRANK BRO!
I love that my favorite YouTuber is is also my favorite rapper
frank has become one of those friends who thinks he can make it in the rap industry 8)
newest addition to odd future? i think so
You should put all your music on iTunes so i can but that shits
Exactly how much w33d was in that sig?
Hey George can you bring back your vlogs („ÄÄ^œâ^)
Canadian Academy is Proud of you!
"Watch where you going you fool!" Looking ass nigga
Something you wanna tell us Georgie?
pretty sure that last verse was inspired by that stupid ass top comment on trap dumplings
Still better than Lil Wayne
What he said about music= so true.
"We want real music we want real music we want george music."
enough internet today.
make a vid about furries or bronies that shit would be hilarious
1:23 sounds like Yonkers by Tyler
What is more cancerous; Frank or the cigarette?
danm... papa franku turned into an Asian Tyler the creator
Frank should collab with RuckaRuckaAli for raps, too bad hes the only grossing youtuber who doesnt actually have a channel
The camera work is getting better...
i would find it hilarious if filthyfrank got cancer, maybe then he'd stop mocking it
I'm only 15 and I wish more people in my generation could enjoy this music
you look like the memer from wendys ad video
This was actually really good +TVFilthyFrank , You should make more videos with your real voice. It's pretty sexy and soothing man.
870 people WANT REAL JOJI MUSIC NYEEES
I was born too "in the wrong generation"to appreciate this music.
Too many normies are discovering Frank, protect Frank at all costs!
This shit is fire idk why people don't like this
Franku has a pussy slayer voice
lice
Fucking gay or something
Edgy cunt
I am 3 years old, and I hate my generation.
Need all this shit on iTunes fam
HABE U SEEN A JON FAVREAU PLS????
does he actualy smoke???üòëüò∑üòÇ
Frank was on pewdiepie
Is this what shit posting looks like daddy?
Never knew you had such musical talent. Showing this side of your personality adds so much more depth to your character, keep it up Big Poppa.
Fuck you fucking filthy dog microwave is awesome!
reminds me of tyler the creator
omq u h8 dhara weeba int fascalled otaku you afaggot ashf jkill u self faggiat!!1

this is my aesthetic
You should drop an album Frank
no tags???
frank obviously hates his shitty fanbase. well, the majority.
I've been listening to this at least twice a day since it came out. It's so catchy and fun. Great job.
wE lov rel musiC plis gibe joji Real musci , 1!

PS.: I love you franku
PinkGuy in 60fps is pRiceless !
He needs to join Odd Future and spit some shit with Tyler and Hodgy.
whats up the the sudden Tyler the creator moment at 1:13
Habe you seen the rice balls pls
yo filthyfrank, pewdiepie watched your pewdiepie tattoo video check it out it on his channel, your funny as fuck too by the way.
there is no way you got 90k natty you fraud
Filthy Frank > Tupac
stop to smoke cigarro not cool man we want you alive bro
DANG! I couldn't stop starring at his crotch. Now I want his dick in my mouth!
Hey Frank, when you gonna make a video about how 99.9% of your fans subconsciously suck your dick?
Wtf
Wtf
wait thats fithy frank:c
Pink guy got the beard :D
At least let me pay for your music
The piano chord progression at 1:12 is very interesting. Beauty mixed in with endless filth... now that is art!
jesus christ what do i have to do to get my comment upvoted?
I rly  don't know why this songs is not   in the top hits . Thanks Frank ...rly  thank for all  your Filthy  videos and thank  you too george
Shit this is good
RIP filthy frank
has a cancer fan base
don't know what he expected
he made this channel to be cancer
the fans deserve the shit at the end btw
he had a speech about how he hates his fans on "fun silly drawings for fun silly people haha" but that page got deleted
this is fire bro like this is real talent
PINK GUY SPITTIN THAT FIRE
An instrumental should be released for this.
Make a 360 video pls b0ss
can we get a trap remix on the let's go to the lobby cause it's SOME GOOD SHIT MAN!
At the start you can see where he all ready threw the rice ball at the window
Aint nothing changed franku, and im not complaining üòÇ still fucking badass. 
"im here to be an act not a role model"
Dude you're just awesome.
give download please i love the middle part and the whole fucking song
I failed. MISERABLY
this was absolutely brilliant!
It's really sad that a lot of people (or people in the comments, at least) missed the point of the video. It's whatever though, I doubt Filthyfrank or Joji or whatever the fuck you want to call him even gives a shit at this point.
your so awsome keep it like that
Lovin it ^^
Is this the beginning of a mental shitstorm? I knew Asians liked to rip off Evangelion, but damn. This video got meta as fuck.
(inb4 defensive comments)
My dick fell off at 1:12, this song is dope ass fuck Frank.
I lub you my squilt lord
like Tyler the creator
that mini golf line was pure genius
So Franku is a great musician who should get a Grammy, an amazing chef who would get approval from Gordon Ramsey and funny comedian and crazy videomaker. I must say, you're a perfect being Frankstar.
Tyler the creator
newly found love for this music. Went off pink guy for a while, but this beat's amazing.
franku react to 'pewds reacts to pewdiepie tattoo'
1:12 T-that piano though..
I still don't quite understand the whole argument around 'real music'. Frank already made real hip hop with Politikz.
I have a feeling he makes all his music in the tub
pink guy or joji in disguise?
I didn't know this guy was so creative. Yeah, he created this monstrosity of an atrocity, but this is pretty good. There is more to this nigga.
This channel is like the the bloody 4chan of YouTube. Weird, offensive and in some sections absolutely disgusting. Like if you agree and frank please get you're crap together. Thx.
How am i suppose to fap to this knowing Han solo dies?!?!?!?!?
album like this pls grandmaster franku
fuck this song is dope
What brand of cigs do you smoke? I'm curious
Frank was 3x better before he hit 1 million subs. The content is still good, but I'm talking about the people that watch him. It's just a bunch of pre-pubescent kids that go around saying stuff like "Gimmee da pussi b0ss."
Wow I just figured this is not how he acts in real life xD
Smoking. Is FUCKING STUPID. Bud is your bud
Now I know how to make rice balls!
Thanks Frank!
WHEN UR MIXXXXTAPEXXX COMING SOOOON?
its a shame that you smoke. üí©üí©üí©üéåüéå

I want a Filthy Frank shirt.. #rip
I wonder if Frank knows he has normal fans that enjoy his content and don't really care whether or not he is Joji or Frank. 

Keep up the good videos.
Dont mind me guys, just looking for youtube explained since he said he likes this cancer :|}
Franku,Dame,Zettai, „Éï„É©„É≥„ÇØÔºå„ÉÄ„É°Ôºå„Çº„ÉÉ„Çø„Ç§Ôºå
So we all know that pink guy raps, but does anyone else work in entertainment? Like does salamander man do anything like this?
Chin chin, 2016 sacrifice ...Bring.Back.Dade
Give FilthyFrank his own Adult Swim show
I had to look away or fucking stop some of your videos... because... sometimes you scare me a little :')
but THIS!!!! this is amazing.
This guy should record Minecraft videos :D
sounds like dumbfoundead lel
Just Pink Guy ;D so good. . .
Damn!
this is one of the best songs I've heard on the internet.. keep up the good work, and DON'T do shit that you don't enjoy -- meaning don't let viewers pressure you into doing a video that you don't want to.
just for a fact, this Video/preparing for this Video took him ~1h (making the rice balls)
frank is an internet rapper with a soundcloud. hmmm
Why did u delete that video of a guy breaking chopsticks with his Aasss?
but do you actually smoke?
fire
lol Frank no can opener?
Based Papa Franku.
So it was "Lobby" the whole time? I'll still always hear "Bla Bleep" though.
This is awesome keep doing you frank
when is the second album coming out? i really enjoyed the first album.
Fuck my bitch b0ss
This is better than all mainstream rap on the radio
keep being yourself b0ss
Let's all go to tha l-l-lobby lets all go to tha l-l-lobby
you should teach us how to make things like rice balls
hey Filthy cockface can we get REAL music please?
paasteell de flanggooo
SWAG ME UP UR CHANNEL IS DONE

So when does the FilthyFrank Cafe open up?  You have already got the menu: Rice Balls, Hair Cake, Trap Dumplings, etc.  The employees can all wear pink body suits and you can have your own music plus the Harlem Shake on repeat for the dinner guests.
God damn, shit's lit
still kinda hard to believe that the guy rapping is the real filthy frank. I get that it's actually him but the contrast between those 2 acts is insane
5/10 uses lyrics from Santa's Brother
0:11 without headphones there's no bass. I watched it with headphones first, then without and it sounded really weak.
sooooooooooooo...
when will the search for pink guy continue?
Missed your videos! :D
animal's üòí
üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Why you change title? Onigiri much better.
I don't care what he says, I want Joji
I never understand why people hates the brony fandom is it because most of them are full grown man who watches a cartoon intended for little girls its,so I did my research and here's is the thing, I guess is that why people judge and hate the brony fandom is because the majority are men who have a obsession over the cartoon like drawing fan art, writing erotic fanfic and making porn of it but here's the thing almost every fandom those this like furry's,spongebob and eve Dora the explorer and there's even more to say and when I was looking online mostly of the people who hate them are people who are a troll,hater,anti brony or a person who have nothing better to do,I don't watch the show I give it a try but it wasn't interesting for me so I never watch it I guess another reason why people's hate them is because the try to force that you must love the show down on your through but its like every fandom out there every one is different some brony say "hey if you don't like it that's cool I won't force the show is not meant for everyone I respect your opinion" or were another brony would say "YOU MUST LOVE THE SHOW IS THING BEST THING EVER" so my opinion on the brony fandom there just people doing what they want really I don't hate them in fact I'm friends with a brony and he's a cool dude in my opinion but yeah another thing that I can say is that they will always be hater but who give a fuck about haters they have cancer and all haters should be sacrifice for lord chin chin
hey that's pretty gooood........
FUCK YES
Filthy Frank is taking over the nets
bring back the johnsonblog
LETS ALL GO TO THE LOBBY

Yo that beat is from human ramen.
i love you papa franku
My dog doesn't like you......burn
This is why japanese deserve the third bombing.
Hey put your albums on spotify
I don't think this is not real music, but I think people really would like to hear serious beats and serious production and this is more comedy-oriented, both in instrumentation and vocals. No offense, your comedy is fine obviously, but don't recant on your word: "Yes, it is about time we start making some serious music (under the alias PinkOmega)." It's not about real or fake, it's about more serious or more comedy, and how seriously-produced music will last a lot longer than comedy in the grand scheme of musical things. Trap Dumplings was culinary and funny, but has production values that still make it your best song to date. Maybe you need an engineer and a producer, or at least someone with whom you can bounce beats back and forth and come up with some cooler ones.
Great as always bebe
Just thought the bass was a little too heavy
lol best flow
Cooking rice and listening to this XD man lets do some crazy shit
one of the best youtube channels every XD
Umm...you don't actually smoke, do you? I mean...isn't that bad for your health? Especially if you have that medical condition where you have seizures...but then again I don't really know. All I've taken is Standard First Aid after all...

this shit is fucking fire and I've listened to it about 50 times today
This video is actually so well made, amazing work Joji, I mean it <3
this song is so inspirational
Frank smokes?
He put on a Rick and Morty esque vibe at the end and thats just amazing
I really really want to see you normally like you know without that weird shit just for one video i want you to wear normal shit and talk with your voice.
Mac Miller with extra chromosomes
This may actually may be one of the only videos on the non-weird side..... EXCEPT FOR THE RAP PART

I actually think this track is dope as fuck.
HEY TAKE IT EASY IM A FUCKING PRINCESS
I don't care about the pewdiepie pie fans because sooner or later they'll become filthy too
Ok.
Am I the only one who finds George hot? I mean he's funny and stuff and when he doesn't put on his retardrd accent he sounds like a boss...
I WAS WATCHING THIS ON THE SHITTER AND MY MOM WALKED IN AND ASKED IF I WANTED A RAMEN

that moment when papa franku is better than most rappers today
Lyrics?
@TVFilthyFrank Are you a Light Designer in theater? I noticed you had an ETC mouse pad in your bad rappers video
why is this not a real song
This is basically an Odd Future song with Pink Guy,

It's amazing.
Love ur humor. Greets from "Nazi Deutschland" u fucked up biatch making #riceBalls ;D
Papa Franku, pls upload pink guy music to spotify
b0ss smoking? i am really dissappointed. i thought he was a good egg
Probs already saw a comment like this kinda reminds me of Tyler the creator's music and odd future I really enjoyed it
George, please bring back the vlogs.
Dude this gets better every time I watch it
love it, brUH
dope
sounds like it shoulda been a PinkOmega song

oh yeah, that was a thing
what happened to it?
i thought he siad "i jerk my kids at soccer practice every tuesday" lolüòÇ
put this on spotify
his house looks filthy
This gets better every time I listen to it.
Good porn
this is actually really fucking good wtf
Can someone watch my dick grow?
Here for my daily dose
This is it folks.........Pink Guy just evolved!!
Still afraid of pewdiepies subs coming onto here since he reacted to the tattoo vid.
I wish I could be a Rap genius like papa franku
It's funny when you find yourself
Looking from the outside
I'm standing here but all I want
Is to be over there

Why did I let myself believe that
Miracles could happen?
'Cause now I have to pretend
That I don't really care

I thought you were my fairy tale
A dream when I'm not sleeping
A wish upon a star
That's coming true

But everybody else could tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
When there was me and you

I swore I knew the melody
That I heard you singing
And when you smiled
You made me feel

Like I could sing along
But then you went and changed the words
Now my heart is empty
I'm only left with used-to-be
And once upon a song

Now I know you're not a fairy tale
And dreams were meant for sleeping
And wishes on a star
Just don't come true

'Cause now even I can tell
That I confused my feelings with the truth
'Cause I liked the view
When there was me and you

I can't believe
That I could be so blind
It's like you were floating
While I was falling
And I didn't mind

'Cause I liked the view
I thought you felt it too
When there was me and you..
Yes.
1:24 but dat ass
Frank is clearly a fantastic rapper and needs to keep this greatness up. Is it just me or you sense a little Tyler the Creator influence in some of the bars and production? I dunno the humorous lyrics reminds of Tyler, maybe I'm just tripping. The video reminds me of Ned Flander an older Tyler video.
Did you guys notice the mark from the rice ball on the window from the end is also on there at the beginning, but only the beginning?

copy much
1:11 :)
sickest beat ever
Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement at the oberman
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth to the childlike man
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand,
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man, ocean man
Ocean man

Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement at the oberman
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth to the childlike man
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand,
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man
Dear Frank. Get your head examined and smoke a joint. Then call me. 7272803372
Is that filthy frank doing the main raping or only the little part in the middle?
Am I the only Muslim who loves Papa Frank?
Where do you live? USA, Japan? Please b0ss, tell me.
Dat Jojivlogs diss though
a million veiws in 3 days...not bad frank....not bad
Poor frank. He's obviously outgrown his act but his fans are devoted to it. Such an odd situation to be in when the only reason you're making videos is because of the fans.
Does this remind anyone else of Tyler the Creator?
Where the hell has this man been all of my life..? TVFilthyFrank has gotta be the best channel I've ever seen on YouTube. Keep up the amazing work Frank!
bring back jojivlogs
To put an old snipars quote to good use; "My iPad is on fire."
notice me frank senpai!!
That Cigar Pan flip trick was Dope!
How are you such a BOSS?
Is Frank actually a smoker? I never saw him as a smoker. (Doesn't matter either way, just curious)
I don't get pussy....





The pussy, comes to me.
What
At 1:12 is when it gets REAL damn cuh
I don't know what people who don't like these songs are talking about, this is still fire even with less serious lyrics.
lyrics
My mum: what's your favorite song?
Me: rice balls
what are you fucking tyler the creator ?
its lit
someone take the time to write the lyrics to this banger
u r my senpai papah franku notice meeeeeeeee!!!1!
Hey you fat asian fucker. you better roast furries next.
a man who gets that music is music it all comes from the same place
Dayum, Franku's making dank beats with that sick MicroKorg XL.
Who said you needed expensive gear to make good music?

You know you're a 90s kid when you wake up in the morning and you want to die
fucking love all the shit you put out franku-sama. Shit keeps getting darker and im with it.
Im just glad he's having fun making videos like he said in his comment, on a video from Maxmoefoe's channel he said something like " okay im gonna go bring pink guy and he's gonna come in here and say something like can  i have pussy pls ? and all the 12 years olds are gonna laugh " that sounded like he thinks that his fanbase is a bunch of kids who laugh at everything, and that also sounded like he's not having fun doing his thing, anyways, im just glad he's INTO what he's doing <3
Living with him must be so chill
Fuck, i can't stop watching this

Dear papa, where did you get your Ph.D. In Internet retardation? I wish to go there
Welcome to the tether dome; The upper echelon, investin' on these large balls. 

I got these pussy bitches waiting like the japanese. Killer whales, humpbacks and these narwhals.

 I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers. I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers. I'm just trying to strangle these... 

This the beat blop, you make the beat flop. Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got:


the beat droppin' harder than your son's balls at 12. Not to mention that we harder than Viagra with the big cock. 

I'll fuck you in the mouth again. I'll let you know that I'm a schizo I be hearin' shit, 

so don't be fuckin' me cause bet you ass I'm hearin' it. (oh) When I get done with you, I'll make sure that your celibate. 

(agouhg) Fuck your dog, I can smack E.T. and I'll fuck you with the radiator pipe. (huh, what is that too rude?) 

I'm a fucking nuisance with different types of abuses. I'm runnin' up in the premises helpin' you tie your nooses,

 'cause all of you fucks the coolest and do not know how to do this. I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses

like oh... Like oh... 

Oh... Oh... (yeah) 

I fuck around for money like a cam-whore; jerk it to my titties pop it off on some gay shit. 

I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or beat their fucking teeth 'cause they raise shit. 

You sound like: "I never respect my kids and I raise the piece of shit and I drop the my kids off at soccer practice (yeah) every Tuesday."

(ogh) This one's for the folks that be dead inside. Mini-golf champion, you got no drive. Player, 

fuck boys treat my dick like a trampoline. I only work with paper like a fax machine. (ahh) 

I'm on the car's hoods screaming like a mammal whippin' through the flannel, burning ass on my chest with the camels. 

I'm here to be an act not a role model. Don't be fuckin' cryin' when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle. 

I'm just chillin' making rice balls erryday. I'm a simple man; I don't need a microwave...

I don't need a microwave... I don't need a microwave... 

I don't need a microwave... I don't need a microwave... 

'Cause I'm already heated (that's not funny)  

(aaoghoaagh. We want real music. We want real music. We want Joji music. aaoghaaogh) 

Bro I didn't even know real and fake music existed. I mean, I think it's like your fault for... Putting that shit into categories.

 know like, music is music if you don't think this is real music, that's your fuckin' you problem. 

Like I... Who says I can't drop shit while... making uh culinary, funny video at the same time. 

You know. Whatever man. It's your boy Pink Guy, Pink OMega whatever the fuck you wanna call me. I don't give a fuck. 

Comin' at you again. Still doin' that wacky crazy shit bro ay, ay, ain't nothing changed. So see you next time.

Easiest fap in my life
You are the only youtuber I know that gets the same amount of views per video as the subscribers you have.
Does Pink Guy listen to DeMarco?
it seems like yesterday you had 100,000 subs
I kinda want to see Tyler the creator do a track with pink guy ,and maybe feature dirt nasty on it
Well then, I feel this lacked the standard autism
You okay, Joji?? You seem depressu-san desu.
Can we have the full beat?
i just listen this music 10  fucking time
Beat and rapping style reminds me of tylerthecreator
this was posted in my birthday...thank you for the erection
Frank the Creator
this sounds like tyler's and earl's mixtape had a baby
Franku why u no in 2015 utub rewind wtf;(
George is a living breathing meme machine, every fucking pose or face he does is priceless... well played Franku desu.
Heaven
guess I'm guilty of asking for "serious" music too, lol. dude, you got a lot of talent, man. keep doing what you've been doing for years
LIT
pink guy, you will die if you keep smoking.
You're a fucking Artist, the lyrics, the editing just suberb man ... suberb.
A burger sack, Kick a grandma in the back, Yes! I sniff crack... 2+1= Autism divide that by 2= Cancer.
straight barsüòÇ
this is the greatest thing ever luv u
Damn, Pink Guy really looks like Frank. I think it's his new shoes
He should join odd future
dude this beat is really good. it would be so awesome if you could upload just the beat. i mean the lyrics is funny and awesome but the beat just wins.
Looks like we got to see what Pink guy does in his spare time when you aren't summoning him. I like him a lot more. So much back story in one song man. Pink guy is a mother fucking gangster.
if that medicine beat is yours idk it's hard to tell, but I'm pretty sure it is. A rap on that would be cool.
japanese don't need microwave to eat some onigiri too.
Frank i migt be high ahs fuck right nwo on cociane and aids but irjs just watned to lejt you know uyo hav rel talent i love u we shuld sex pm me at mcdonalds application websitje thanks

+TVFilthyFrank I would love to see George in a Filthy Frank video like in the How to Win A Girl's Heart thing you did. 
Also why did you delete your SoundCloud?
60fps? What are you fucking gay?
3:03 pink guy's internal struggle to decide if he should hit the cigarette or take another bite of the rice ball
I like my beats the way I like my booty. fat.
I love you. I want to have your babies. Please. <3
This is the hypest rapper with down syndrome I ever seen
Ayyy,frank PewDiePie finally reacted to the butt tattoo video
He's a SPIRITUAL LYRICAL MIRACLE.
His kitchen is cleaner than my kitchen.
love it
Cool guy of 2016 filthy frank
u talk horrible and rap with a gods a voice
Frank Is Half Asian
frank I love your Sh*t keep it up
make an instrumental
what program did you use to make this beat?
2:25 Papu can I make that my new steam profile pic?
Personally, I haven't been able to watch the newer videos the same. I find the humor isn't the same as it used to be. I don't know if he's trying to appeal to the growing audience, or maybe he's just evolving into another style of comedy. Anyways, that's not the point. I like things like this; where he keeps it real. I really did like this Joji vlogs, and the swag Joji. Unfortunately, he's decided to take those down. I hope you do more things like this in the future. Keep up the good work fam.
-Hentai
he reminds me of tyler the creator
Remember when papi franku didn't live like a pig? Ya.. Me neither.
Bro FUCK everyone, make shit YOU want to make, be selfish it's alright to be selfish, you make fuckin dope music funny or serious, don't focus about your fuckin fans and shit, people are fuckin asshole eating pricks, fuck em they're faggots, I vibe to your music heavy and I really wanna hear more but only some shit you want to/enjoy making.

Welcome to the Teledome, the upper echelon invested on these large balls,

when I get done with you I make sure that your celibate, (ewwwwww)
fuck you dawg I can smack-a your teet, and I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe. (Heh...what is that too rude?)
I'm a fuckin' nuisance with different types of abuses I'm runnin' up in the premises helpin' you tie your nooses,
cuz all of you fucks are clueless and do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage then put my finger in pusses 
Like oohhh (2x)

Yo, I fuck around for money like a Cam-Whore, jerk it to my titties pop it off on some gay shit!
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or beat their fucking teeth in cuz they raise shit!
You sound like, "I never spank my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday."
This is for the folks that be dead inside, mini golf champion you ain't got no drive, playa
Fuck boys treat my dick like a trampoline, I only work with paper like a fax machine, uh
I'm on the cars hood screaming Micheal Mammal,

The best cooking show out there on the youtube, he taught me how to make rice balls.

Pewdiepie just spread his cancer of 8 year olds to your channel.
I was not expecting such a fucking good beat. nice man
Do you post your beats online? I love it. You are very talented. This would be so fun to freestyle with.
Thanks frank ! Now I finally know how to make riceballs
holy shit man you are great. thanks for pumping out a bunch of videos and making me cry :^) take it easy b0ss
Fuckin love it
Be my daddy
honestly Frank this is good motivation because your songs are not actually pg-13 they are rated R but I mean if you actually get a deal with Spotify I'm pretty sure this could pay off and work out pretty well in your favor and get you quite a bit of money off of making songs like these!
Will you do more rants Frank? Franku Franku Franku GAWD
Thanks for stepping your shit up to higher framerates daddy :*
Lets all send papa a dollar so he can be a millionaire and make golden rice balls
2:36 - 3:13 I fucking love you

I love you
beat making skillz: perfection
kylo ren theme
This deserves a God Damn FUCKING Grammy.
You don't have to explain yourself to these faggots papa franku. We always loved you. Fuck the h8ters
Nice reference to the goat Chali 2na in the first line
PLEASE make a vid for JUST the beat. Please.

why do people care if he makes Music you don't like let him make content he wants to make
Oh god I came so hard
The thumbnail makes it seem like you are gonna go on a rant, change it to make it seem more like the thumbnail of a song
Good video!
Clean your dojo though.
I hate you
do boom beach gameplay
It's hilarious that pink guy is an excellent rapper (as if there are any) but when he's talking it's just EY B0SS and NYEEEEEEEEES
I am not nigga but yellow
Its Pepper Time!
A+ for effort
Dizastamusic
just to let you know, I cry myself to sleep every night just knowing I will never be the pure god of filth and bangin' raps that Pink Guy is. It's gotten to the point where every time I see the color pink I pop a massive boner and excrete a mixture of cum and piss as I salivate uncontrollably. Your raps are the sour but delicious breast milk of the voluptuous teet of my ears' desire. Please continue to allow Pink Guy to rap or else I will surely commit a double suicide of me and my Pink Guy body pillow.
Can someone tell me where he got that piano sample during the breakdown?
that bari sax
i like this stuff, but i think you should just leave this profile to your social experiments, rants and other shit. i think you should create a separate channel for your music.
I love to watch autism in 1080p 60fps, woohoo.
GIVE US A NEW CAMERA RANT!!!!
Can someone tell me where can find the beat
Better than Drake!
btw I will freestyle audition if I have to prove myself
sexy

The walk-in bathroom scene at the beginning of the video was hilarious. That bathroom is 5 stars!
lol fucking Joji, youre the one calling it "real music" when you said, that youll make two albums, the pink guy one and a "real" one for the other fanbase. Cunt
I love you frank i don't care if my parents don't want me to watch you I do anyway üé∂üëçüèæ
This reminds me of Tyler the creator for some reason...

Btw go to pewdiepies video reacting to your vid and comment som random shit
This was actually good
this better blow up. this is some good shit
The most offensive thing about Franku's videos has always been the fact that he wastes food. I don't know, that's unacceptable to me. Food is fucking holy. It's always bothered me, seeing food being wasted.

Aside from my boring opinion, love the video!
Ive listened to this like 9 times in a row
Oh fck me when did you get 1 mil subs??? Skrub:)
Noticed by Senpai Pewds
„ÉÑ„Éä„Çµ„É©„ÉÄ
Thank you George. You have sacrificed so much of your time for our pleasure. Your content has helped me through the years. In fact the song "kill yourself" prevented me from actually hanging myself.
 The ridicule of suicide made me rethink my decisions and helped me through my depression. Of course it wasnt only you entirely, but the full picture of your content helped me realize that things werent that bad. 
My fedora is fully tipped mlady.
MORE PLEASE OMG
That lobby sample is sick as fuck
DUDE YES THE BASs I LOVE IT and damn dude adobe cc ?
wtf xD
This video gave me AIDS
Australian tyler...a+ papa franku

AYE FILTHY PEWDIEPIE REACTED TO YOUR ASS TATTO VIDEO DAT BITCH DIDNT APPROVE
nice song Joji
*Marry me * LOL
This was pleasing to listen to. 6/10 x
On one hand it's kinda weird to have one of the best musicians (I've seen) to be making music in a pink skin tight lycra suit.
On the other hand pink guy spits super hot fire and I really like this style. Like.... So much...
And it's not even like a "produce more" thing, it's more of a "I'm glad to be able to witness the movement" kind of thing.
Toppest kek pink guy, spitting more fire than a dragon.
You know I'd so buy this song and listen to it on the go. This shit was dope.
Plz get this signed 10/10 radio hippity hop scotch shit
wtf I was sitting here thinking this channel is like, not my thing, childish n shit. then I saw this like wtf this is genuinely decent

THE BASS FK ME
I have nothing but the utmost respect for you and what you want to do and love the music you make, so you do you bro. I'll just sit back and enjoy the ride
You should make a video about furries being the most cancerous part of society
Yeh I totally heard BMO say Finn during this song
Pewdiepie brought me here.
wasn't this the beat that was used briefly in Human Ramen
You're music is the only reason I watch your channel anymore. I love it. I used to think the Filthy Frank stuff was funny but It's childish to me now. I still think it's great that you're doing cause you know, you do you, man. Anyway, Just trying to let you know I love your music and I hope you keep at it.
1:25 sounds like bmo
Filthy Frank is the savior of the internet
filthy frank is ok, but the amount of filthy frank fans that flood csgo that are often no older than 13 that try to be like him aren't.
ur voice is gold man
smooth
rawr xD
This was exceptionally filthy..
prepare for pewdiepie fans
"we want joji music"?
lmfao
i've never seen a person insult their own fanbase so much
Duz pink guy live in the bathtub?
fire FIRE EVERYWHERE ON THIS TRACK
please make a video about the furries they are trying to take over
this is actually one of my favorite songs its pretty fucking moist
HOLTY SHIT
w-where da subtitles ( ‚öÜ _ ‚öÜ )
Every hour we get closer to the day that Frank makes a cringe video reaction on his second channel...to one of his own videos. It just seems like, over time, George is starting to hate his own fan base for the "ey b0ss" type of shit more and more, and it's hard to blame him.
Dang this song makes me sad now
bars
floobit
well since pewdiepie promoted your channel, now some kids probably will think its funny.
Okay no
Them beats are fucking sick. 1:11 was smooth as fuck.
Pink omega

This is almost as good as Arik and Marik
iTunes please b0ss
WTF is this shit? lmao
Muh... Muh furth wall. Jk I appreciate the fact that you are willing to address the viewer's complains and refer to yourself as joji. It's like telling the viewers to grow up. I love it. Keep it up homie.
Frank's music is pretty great
I LOVE YOU FRANKUUU
After watching this 6 times, i finally noticed his broken house
PinkOmega > PinkGuy

Dude
Yiou should totally start putting your shit on itunes and make some bare dollar

When you payed off your child support.
When you payed off your child support.
I'm always impressed at the quality of the production in your songs and it doesn't help that they are actually pretty good if it wasn't for the silly lyrics in most cases. 

 You guys are pretty fucking talented even though you spend a lot of time making fucked up videos. Cheers to the Filthy crew!
1 mil  veiws

This is actually a pretty legit song
INGREDIENTS

For the Rag√π
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 pound ground beef
1/2 cup chopped onion
Salt
1/4 cup grated carrots
1/4 cup finely diced celery
One 14-ounce can Italian plum tomatoes (preferably San Marzano) with juice, crushed
1 teaspoon tomato paste
1/2 teaspoon crushed hot red pepper
1 cup fresh or frozen peas
For the Rice
5 cups Chicken Stock (page 74), canned reduced-sodium chicken broth or water
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 cups short-grain rice, such as Carnaroli or Arborio
4 large eggs
2 cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese
To Coat and Fry the Rice Balls
2 eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 cups fine, dry bread crumbs
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1/3 cup olive oil, plus extra for frying


PREPARATION

Make the rag√π (up to 3 days in advance)
Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat. Crumble in the meat and add the onion. Cook, stirring often, until the water given off by the meat is evaporated and the meat and onion begin to brown, about 10 minutes.
Season the beef and onion lightly with salt. Stir in the carrots and celery and continue cooking until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, tomato paste, red pepper, and salt to taste. Adjust the heat to simmering and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened, about 30 minutes. If the sauce starts sticking to the pan at any time during cooking, stir in a few tablespoons of water. Stir in the peas and cook until they are very tender, about 10 minutes for frozen peas and 20 minutes for fresh peas. The finished rag√π should be dense and reduced. Remove and cool to room temperature.
While the rag√π is cooling, make the rice
Bring the stock or water and 2 tablespoons olive oil to a boil in a 3-quart saucepan. Stir in the rice, return the water to boil, then adjust the heat to simmering. Cook the rice, uncovered, until al dente‚Äîtender but firm‚Äîabout 12 minutes. Drain the rice and spread out on a tray to cool to room temperature. When the rice is cool, scrape it into a mixing bowl and beat in the 4 eggs and the grated cheese.
Take a handful (about 1/3 cup) of the cooled rice mixture and shape it into a small ball in the palm of your hand. Make a well in the center of the ball and drop in 1 tablespoon of the rag√π. Work the rice so that it completely encloses the rag√π, and re-form the rice into a smooth ball. Continue forming arancine with the remaining rice and rag√π.
Whisk the 2 eggs in a mixing bowl. Spread the flour on one plate and the bread crumbs on another, in an even layer.
Dredge a few of the rice balls in flour to coat all sides. Tap off excess flour. Roll the rice balls in the beaten egg to coat, allowing any excess egg to drip back into the bowl. Finally, roll the rice balls in the bread crumbs, pressing lightly to coat evenly with the crumbs. Remove to a clean baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining rice balls.
If you‚Äôd like to serve the rice balls hot, heat the oven to 200¬∞ F or to the lowest setting. Line a baking sheet with a double thickness of paper towels. Pour the vegetable oil and olive oil into a deep skillet. Insert a deep-frying thermometer in the oil and heat the oil over medium heat to 375¬∞ F. (If you are working without a thermometer, test the temperature as directed below.) Once the oil reaches temperature, adjust the heat under the pot to maintain a steady temperature.
If you‚Äôre not working with a thermometer, test the temperature of the oil by dipping a rice ball in the oil. It should give off a lively but steady sizzle. If nothing happens, the oil isn‚Äôt hot enough; if the oil around the bread-crumb coating boils and sputters, the oil is too hot. Adjust the heat accordingly.
When the oil comes to temperature, carefully slip about a third of the rice balls into the oil. Fry, turning as necessary with tongs or a slotted spoon, until golden brown and crisp on all sides, about 4 minutes. Remove to the paper-towel-lined baking sheet, keeping them hot in the oven if you like. Fry the remaining rice balls. The arancine can be served hot or at room temperature.




NORMIES GET OUT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Damn this reminds me of Tyler, The Creator, especially the ''I just wanna strangle these fuckers" part
holy shit
dope ass beat and amazing lyricism. how can Franku be so good at memes AND so good at music????
this shit went hard
DISCLAIMER- Please have a fire extinguisher next to your computer, put some protection on, call the fire department and get ready to pick some shit up. When this beat drops the fire is lit so you better be careful.
ok, we get it, you smoke
I can't tell if its the sleep deprivation, but this as edgy as fuck.
Hey I'm a hobby music producer/musician and I was wondering if you could show us the gear you use for music-- I noticed the Traktor sticker.  Big fan.
Using gun noise for the beat is fucking brilliant.
Franku is amazing at rap, but in such a weird way xD

I'd also like to note that this video has twice the views of most Strange Music videos, including a lot of Tech N9ne's stuff. Crazy.

Saying hat, Franku needs to fucking get signed into Strange Music.
Pink guy/Joji would be a the best member in Odd Future , he suits those guys
thas som good shit
cant wait for the tyler the creator and filthy frank team up
What music genre would you call this?
Sometimes i think you should stop making videos, they're not bad but i think that you need to advance in your life more i mean do you even know what your going to do in the future because having a job that could support you happily means that you wont have as much free time as you wish to have. Just to let you know i really do like your videos.
I'm actually worried for The real Frank
sigh.... the fans are the cancer
Lyrics pls
heh. 60fps
Please upload instrumental only version
Obama shot Tupac
if the red Leblanc or as you call your self aezakmeme hi to you
Hey Frank. I fucking love your videos man they're the funniest shit to me. But with these Pink Guy raps i see some real fucking talent man. You should consider doing a Politicz type thing and actually do something with rap. Your voice and writing when you rap is genuinly amazing. Upvote this so franku can see, or don't i don't really care. Anyway... Consider it man. Keep up the great work.
Frank, you are fuckin' crazy man, and I love it. Keep it up bro!
This is better than some of the top ten songs
Nice beat man, keep on having fun and sharing that fun ;)
Oh I miss you, Pink Guy! Happy new year to everyone there! :D Your videos just get better and better, Frank. I love you! <3
Will we ever see Pink Guy on spotify?
Fire
heeeyyy b0ss....please ...dont get the cancer in 2016
Why does his place look like a dump? That youtube cash not very good or something?
I love ur vids and pls make more vids that are awesome like the ones u make now
Thx Frank. Im ur biggest Frank.
-Christopher
Love the cinematography bro :)
Please do more of this. IDGAF if it's pink guy or pink omega or even joji
THAT  SHIT IS FIRE
Sometimes I ask myself:"How the fuck this guy hasn't a Grammy yet?"
The intro is just like a fallout trailer
this shit is actually fire
The fucking production quality is getting so good
I WANT REAL MUSIC I WANT JOJI MUSIC AAAAAA
I NEED the lyrics for this
This music video is the food network on acid, I fucking love this, making rice balls to dope beats
What kind of camera(s) do you use for your videos?
2:19
...but I do, what does that say about me? :C
Dude, that track is so fucking good.
you should be in odd future
better than all the trash other rappers make these days
I wanted to learn how to make rice balls and get a laugh so I watched this masterpiece
Is there gonna be a pink guy concert?
The best present for the new year ! :D
dank
Dude, you probably get this alot, but wow, you have a huge fucking talent

Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„Å†„Çà„Å≠ÔºüÈù¢ÁôΩ„ÅÑ„Çà„Åä
the only thing this great video misses is lyrics
pink daddy with the beets1!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He forgot the seaweed.
That beat is fire
Pink guy in Pookie's glasses.

If thats not stylish, then nothing fucking else ever is.
00:32 PinkOmega is Keith Ape confirmed
Best thing about the new year is chin chin sacrifice 2016
what is the name of the sound that start at0:24 stops at 0:44 and gets back at 0:53
Reminds me of Tyler the Creator
Papi Pinku with the hits!
This is the quality content i came here for
A perfect mix of your musical intelligence and your highly enjoyable humour
almost 80k likes. nice job pink guy (bts credit as well :) !)
Asian/Australian Kendrick Lamar.

I cant stop listening to this holyyyy
Oh man, only you could make a rap song I like.
We all love you filthy bastard <3

Keep having fun and enjoying the v√≠deos while you make them and Im sure that we will enjoy them to!
Hey, Joji.. I hope you had a good year and take it easy, ok..? I know that stuff is kinda bluh and all. 2016 should be relaxing for us all, including you!
I fucking Love you. <3
You look like that turtle dude from that raccoon spy game
franku the creator
Holy Based God, I can't believe I've been watching this filthiness for like 3 years. Just realized you got like 1.5million subscribers now, shits crazy.
Wouldn't it be sick if Pink Guy and Tyler the Creator did a collab? I think they'd dig each others styles pretty well. Both got mad talent
Pretty stoked for 2016.
This song is fucking awesome üî•üî•üî•
This video made me google out what is life.
Clean your fucking hob.
Happy New Years PapaFranku.
one of pink guys/omegas best songs yet
That was so fucking beautiful. Fucking grade A. Thank you Joji. Thank you.

You have brightened my day with smiles.
Me and my dad jacked off together to this

I sexually identify as a rice ball and you eating my kind offends me.
If sum1 culd get a download link 2 this song I give u gud succ

I was walking down the street beating off the the street lights when they changed colors I had an orgasm which led to a seizure I went to a hospital with cum all over me my mom showed up beat me because the hospital bill after I went home listened to this and hung my self with a rope I made out of my cats whiskers
whats the difference between pink guy and ayatollah
I feel some Odd Future vibes
Let's all go to the lobby! Let's all go to the lobby
10/10 good song
I've been wanting this for so long. praise be to cheezus.
Am I the only one who actually wants to see personal videos george makes?
60fps is so fucking sexy
is it just me or does he look 'twice as asian' with the chin patch?
lyrics




Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals; I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these

This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday"
This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal ripping through the flannel, [?]
I'm here to be an act not a role model
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday
I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
Cause I'm already heated
(That's not funny)

[Outro]
(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem
Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video at the same time, you know?
Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time
i know i wish franki was my dad!!
you should join odd future
Dayum. Pink guy got game!
Cancer
Why do FF raps sound so damn good?

I'll fuck your face again

"WE WANT THE REAL JOJI SHIT" lmfao. Who caught that? ;D
Nice one, Franku-just keep being you! Love to hear some new stuff from ya ‚òÜ
Undertale fans are faggots.

Hey That's pretty good
Dude I love this shit.
I've always wanted to watch  Franku-senpai in 60fps.
daddy
Oki have to subscribe
Is that his actual voice?
Bad is smoking for you
damn wheres dl link
To all the people who ask for "real" music or "serious" music, I used to be you, then I grew some balls and realized that people can do what they want. This is "Joji" music. Enjoy it. Stop being a little piss baby. 

Love you, Frankie.
This video made me hungry for papa franku's testicles.
fps2gud
He reminds me of Lil'Dicky
who watching this in your grandma's womb? #2PacKilledCastro
I wish more people of my generation listened to this song. THE GENERATION SUCKS!
Inspired me to make some beats, thanks bro
Beat so hot my laptop caught fire,  A+ Franku
Boring kinda but love ur music make more shit with maxmofoe
I think I would rather get genital warts on my asshole then to watch this again.
the other day this was called onigiri. illuminati?
Keep it up man, love your music.
Can someone tell me why i watch this?
I thought you were cool till I learnt you smoked African chilrden ¬•¬•¬•¬•¬•¬•¬•
Let's all go to the Gas Chamber.
i use these like cooking shows, my kitchen expertise increases exponentially with each pink guy rap.
i thought about sushi when i saw onigiri... needa go back to Japanese 101 b0ss
Pink guy has such a rich Carmelly voice when he's not screaming at frank and raping himself with a rusty spoon
THE MEME MACHINE KILLS IT AGAIN
Damn, I never thought I would get a lesson on how to make rice balls from pink guy.
wow that was some good camera work
"we want real music. we want joji music"
Trap Dumplings > Rice Balls
Has PinkOmega sold out?
The audio + video production on your vids just keeps getting better, gl for 2016 fam
what a god
Some tasty looking jelly donuts
so uh frank when that next album gonna drop i dont care about when it is i just want to know that theres another album so i can just jerk off to the thought of your lyrics
Honestly, you can probably join Odd Future.
That bulge is impressive
People say his comment section is cancer but basically every youtube comment section is cancer
Pretty happy people have started thinking of you as more of one person rather than two characters
If frank smokes that means we will be provided with less years of wild content, oh shit
This reminds me of Tyler The Creator back in the Bastard and Goblin days, maybe a little Wolf. But this shit was fire af
filthyfrank  fuck you stop being this cool edgy guy like youre making all the meme kids be cool now xd xd xdoisjd0aw i
Is this song on your bandcamp? I can't find it
Wow.

Imagine this:
First Filthy Frank concert,
he takes off his mask at the end, turns out he's actually Skrillex.

That'd be pretty cool.
That lil piano at 1:11 makes me 
F L O A T
Why are you smoking that's cancer it self stop talking about stuff being cancer if your giving your self cancer just stop its time to stop smoking
lets all go to the lobby.
the biggest crime is the tile work in that shower
it's all clear to me now
Pink guy spits more fire than most of these shitty mainstream rappers that you see, fuck lil wayne man
lmfao opens can of tuna with fucking pliers
Wait... Is that Frank's real voice?
I want me some rice balls now
I want me some rice balls now
this shit slap gj
This such a banger, wtf. The beat is actually really good and his ending verse was so powerful. It's not about whether Joji or Pink Guy raps, its the music.
Frank got bars
FF a real og
gets evicted for smoking
nfetask nfetask cenemyetaask cgthgtnetask nfetask nfetask nfetask
nfetask nfetask cenemyetaask cgthgtnetask nfetask nfetask nfetask
Is this like the Korean Tyler Creator
I don't think anyone here is wondering where the fuck he is... Btw he doesn't make any money from his videos so what does he do? I think I'm gonna become a filthy frank stalker.
Fresh
When boys can cook
This made my nips hard !
Joji is actually gonna actually get cancer If he keeps smoking which is pretty ironic
this is a shity awesome video
So wait, are Pink Guy and Pink Omega the same character or not?
WTHF that was fuckin awesome bastard
INSTRUMENTAL PLS

Pappa Frankyboy this song is actually nice as fuck.

What is the recipe
happy new year you durry muncher
You are my hero Frank
I dont care what 'type' of music frank uploads, you just need to upload the instrumentals somewhere bro, that shit is killer.

PINK GUY X MC MENOR DA VG

That was top notch.
The most beautiful song ever made.

I feel like he would be a good writer for Rick and Morty
half japanese, half autralian and black inside.
we love ya frank
I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday. LOL! Awesome video! I can understand why you'd want to put two and two together, it makes this video educational in the culinary field and includes the rap genre! I like this a lot!
This was super wacky one of the best goofs.
WHERE THE F√ñK IS MY REGULAR UTRO?
best shit ever
He should really start a FilthyFrank vevo or something
Franku is straight God
Wow Tyler the Creator looks different and sounds a little less black
Frank u got no chill bro
whoever made this beat is a genius
good beat
Hey Frank, maybe you should make another album for your new songs. Also I love this one nice work. Happy New Year.
I see you using goya. keep up the good work man.
You're actually such a cool guy franku
Hey, that's pretty good.
1:11 is pretty dope
Wat was dat.
I actually like this track. not in a joking way. but I actually find it catchy
When are you going to do a mailbox? It has the potential to be the worst thing ever. Think about every FF fan combining their autistic worship all in one location.
someone give me lyrics
Clean your fucking kitchen.
So afraid of waking up one day to news of Joji having killed himself. No joke, lately it seems like he has so much shit piled up, cancerous fanbases do not help.
this made me cum like a shrek meme
Who else is watching in 6 million chromosomes?
I'm wet !1!1!!
Your Chin beard is the fucking Cringemesiter. What's next Maxmoefoe grows Pubes.

I listened to this with a friend with extreme bass and it rumbled the whole house...
Perfect videos don't exis-
So pink guy is pink omega?

Lighting your cig on the oven.

0:17 Relax your noodle, Papa Franku!
Sorry to say this Filthy Frank, but I am taking this channel down under the YouTube rule 263a due to 1: Trauma 2: promotion of smoke CIGGARETTS of which you can get a cancer from. 3: misuse of the English language.

I love this channel
MORE CAKES
This sounds like Tyler the creator
I don't care if it's real or fake, as long as you keep making music in your style. Because fuck me sideways you're good. And i mean, your entire channel is dedicated to satirical/facetious shit, including your music. You made tracks that didn't have a comedic side to them, those were great. You made shit like this, which is also great. Why're people complaining?
People need to shut the fuck up (including me) and just listen to the music.
Really good beat. Reminds me a bit of Lil Ugly Mane, particularly the piano bit.
go bills
3:01 PINK GUY = PINKOMEGA CONFIRMED!!!

(SPREAD THE WORD!!!!)
like a true Japanese tune, i love those piano jazz
Fuck me. Franky-San
This shit is hotter than burnt rice balls.

welcome to the rice fields
This should have a flammable warning before the video start
I'm uploading all the jojivlogs again.

So.. is pinkOmega and pink guy to different guys, and not Frank being both?

You look like theneedledrop in this
I love you filthy frank but your apartment looks like crap
Thank you for your content and thanks for the laughs. I appreciate what you do.
This confirms that Frank truly is the bastard son of Tyler The Creator and Son of Sam
But seriously this sounds like the last half of Buffalo
Waiting for a collab with Tyler The Creator
This some next level Franku shit
His soul-patch is slowly growing into an epic neckbeard...... soon...... soon you'll be one of us Papa Franku.

One of us

Bars.
Dear Filthy Frank,You're a faggot, a good kind of faggot. Thank you for being a fucktard on the internet, it takes a¬†lot of ass and balls to act like¬†an autistic little shit in front of millions of people. Thank you for making me laugh my scrotum off till I cry or cry until my dad beats me horrendously. Weeabos are like Jews, they are the scum of the Earth. You are like the Hitler of Weeabos. I worship you and pray to you every night. I created my own cult with all of¬†my band friends called TVFilthyFrankism. I have my own dinner prayer for you before I feast on the flesh of dead Weeabos to make you proud. I played a batsu game where I made out with an old lady from behind who was 107 years old who smelled¬†worse than¬†southeast Asia. Your backyard represents the rice fields of the world, that's where I bury my victims aka my adopted brothers who are Chinese and don't deserve your affection. Thank you for teaching me how to eat the whole ass, I use my skills wisely.
Fuck yes. Thanks Frank.
Gag on my dick
I love you George p l e a s e
Nice
make a cooking channel... srsly
I know how to make rice balls now, thank you frank daddy.

lyrics and delivery on point. beats great but doesn't have that full feeling that trap dumplings had. It's not the lack of bass. it's something else. Keep it up bruh, you do good work.

What'd I tell you, fucking faggot.
I feel like he's gonna take this down and its gonna get reuploaded and people are gonna be like "dude take it down that's disrespectful to Joji n' stuff hurr hurrr."
+TVFilthyFrank, you should do a hate video on bronies. I am one, but I know that shit would be hilarious.
I like his little monologue at the end of the song. Magen I heard it I realized that he's kinda annoyed by the people who want "real music" like his actual joji music. I felt an energy coming from his voice. Something is coming. Something big.
YO THAT END WAS TOO REAL üî•
1:53 franks official face while raping yo girl
instant goosebumps to the manhood
This is the best beat of 2017 yet.
Worst than Tyler the Creator
B0ss you need to do something about reaction channels
This video is well made, the music is good, and the editing was done well. Holy shit, papa franku makes some quality content
next time attach go pro to the rice ball
Waiting for this song since Kill Yourself.
good
Frank, I look up your video and all I see is mix tapers reacting to your vids.  Reaction vids need to die.

joji. this was amazing
i fucking love u
What you did was just so inhuman
Can you tell us what software you use to make the background music.
Franku my life is boring. How can I aquire your chromosomal number?
uhuhuhhhu WE WANT REAL MUSIC WE WANT JOJI MUSIC
Franck can you give me the recipe to do that rice balls i freacking love rice :p
Were is the Idubbbz iv been looking for
Itch my balls while I eat rice balls while masturbating
What's the song,or instrumental?
We didn't get any "lets get some pussy tonight" in this video WTF
This was the exact reason YouTube let's you upload 60FPS videos.
Joji back 2016?
Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these

[Verse 2]
This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

[Interlude]
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 3]
I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday" This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role mode;
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave

Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)

[Outro]
(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem
Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video at the same time, you know?
Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time
Frank just needs to stop listening to his fans so much and do him.
#saveJoji
I love this kitchen.

the drums would be so nice soaked in reverb, it would give them a little life and give the instrumental more atmosphere.
the production on this beat is dirty af
I wonder how totally disappointed his parents are
"Ain't nothing changed"

Except the beat and rhyme quality... Jesus Christ, Papa Franku- step your shit up.

Trap Dumplings was a masterpiece, this was "The Courtney Love special".
Dude, you have a fucking career in this
Eminem is in big trouble...
Instrumental and lyrics

WE WANT REAL MUSIC WE WANT JOJI MUSIC
Awesome.
This song is fire
That was good, dude. Honestly it's really cool that you produce your own instrumentals. I wish people would do that more often. Nothing is better than finishing a song and thinking, "Damn, I made that... And people like it!!" Also, I thought it was great that you addressed the whole Joji music thing. Would live to hear more music. Whether it's "real" or not.
nek minute... PinkGuyVEVO
Wasn't this called ONIGIRI?!?!?!?!?!?!
Who wants to go to the lobby with me?
Fuck this was awesome , really love the song yo!

B-but h-hey I'm doing it i-ironically right guys? Also guys in a permanent identity crisis cause his aussie dad fvcked a chinagirl so he's trying to sound American while pretending Japanese people are hardcore cause he's sooo Japanese, mr.

Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement at the oberman
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth to the childlike man
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand,
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man, ocean man
Ocean man

Ocean man, take me by the hand, lead me to the land that you understand
Ocean man, the voyage to the corner of the globe is a real trip
Ocean man, the crust of a tan man imbibed by the sand
Soaking up the thirst of the land

Ocean man, can you see through the wonder of amazement at the oberman
Ocean man, the crust is elusive when it casts forth to the childlike man
Ocean man, the sequence of a life form braised in the sand,

vevo

i swear to god im seriously eating rice right now while watching this, didnt even know what frank was up too lol
Frank plz bring your brother back on the show! He was great! #GoneButNotForgotten
Shawn Wasabi ft Papa Franku

Loved it, not bad at all. Good song funny video, hehe

Happy new year Frank and wow this is true comeback of sick pink guys music
mac miller video tho
Where PinkOmega tho.
when is the next mixtape gonna drops
I wonder if he will stop smoking soon
Sounds a lot like tyler the creator
Oh boy another song for somebody to play in CS:GO Comp
This video was really funny last year
Damn now I want rice balls üòÇüòÇ
I wanna see u next time too
yoooooooooooooooooooo the beat is insane on this one frank, nice job
black people raised him.
I love it like always.
one time I questioned life and started watching pinkguy it's actually gave me a reason to live
This song is actually fire
i was touching myself to this
I guess this is the first pink guy video that I do not hear a YESS or Boss
Pink Guy! How did you get out of Chin Chin's clutches? or are you still a prisoner to his deceptions?
he should so make a t.v show.
bet dem rice balls taste like shit
first
Do you like Tyler the creator?
b0ss i habe contracted brest cansur from dis songe.
Farnk, NEVER CHANGE!  Keep smoking, keep saying racist and offensive jokes, keep being retarded while triggering bunch of faggots at the same time. Keep it real ! 
Love you, #nohomo.
i need this beat ;ppp
what is this? we want real music we want politikz music
Since when this was HD? It's so filthy!
This kinda reminds me of Tyler the Creator
60fps
I NEED THE BEAT
i see you're adding lung cancer to your ongoing list of diseases
God fucking dammit lmao
Sometimes I wonder about the conditions of your apartment/house/etc. Pink Guy...
He's actually better than famous rappers like 'lil wayne and drake, but then again, everyone is better than them.
Best song ever...
Those glasses remind me of stephen chow in the movie "Out of the dark"... Anyone else?
His flow is actually crazy
D
O
P
E
This song is actually addicting, I keep coming back.
Why do I wish Pink Guy raps were on the radio instead of modern rap music.... this shit is so clever matched with the fact that its over all just hilarious to listen to him rap, whilst keeping a great flow and sounding like a professional. 

Keep up the great work Papa Franku. 
Happy New Year.
Pink guys back niggaz
this video made me a satanist ty 10000000000000/2
Does Filthy Frank actually smoke?
Lyrics?
All the dislikes are the new kids that weren't around to hear FilthyFrank's music
this one was lame i dont understand a word
We love yu, Mister B0ss balls
i lik u
That solo where Joji talks shit to his fans demanding his serious shit
Fucking savage








What is real music? If no one knows what music is , then does music exist? Is it an allusion made my human perception? Is anything real?
Thanks goodness Filthy Frank still exists
you should stop being a meme and produce more

Tyler the Creator had an aborted son and his name was FilthyFrankTV and his no. 1 hit is rice balls featuring DJ Khaled and back up dancing by former President Bush.

I  love/hate these good rap videos. The raps are good and so are the beats, but they just make me so hungry.
Good video HowToBasic
Reminded me a little of Devo for some reason.
Keep going dude

PAPA FRANKUUU

Is this the new MF Doom album?
b0ss do more vids pls
Hopefully Papa Franku reaches 2,000,000 subscribers in 2016! üî•üòéüî•
1:12 Holy shit I was not expecting that.
Preview of new album?  0;
I can't tell if he is trying to make legit music or doing this just for laughs, because I kind of like it...
2016...year of the b0Ss
He's raps always remind me of Tyler The Creator. Good shit
will you be putting out another album any time soon?
idgaf dude, I still want Joji, he can do some actual good ass shit. like yeah he's gotta point this srill is music, and it's pretty fuckin good. but I want to hear some real shit broski feel me cuh.
Read franks channel description fags
Loved the song man, u rule!
Pink guy >Pink omega
Actually, although I think these are supposed to be satirical, I fuckin' loved this one
Song name?
This song is kinda like Korean Jesus by Dumbfounded...or maybe im just tripping
This type of raping reminds me of Tyler The Creator. 


Oh and his rapping is good too.
That beard tho
Am I the only on addicted to this like black tar heroine and deodorant fumes?
Whos watching this in 201Han Solo dies
Heard you dropped your mixtape in that tower in Dubai.
Who cleans his house?????
i hope you get a grammy
I feel like his probably the coolest guy you could meet besides his autistic alter ego (pink guy) lmao.
i love u frank!!
All the Pinkguy songs are fucking amazing.
Your cinematography has greatly improved there last couple vids.
Good Job bro.!
Frank, the wiki says that you are at least 400,000 chromosomes old. It also says a chromosome is a tenth of a day. Some simple math shows that you are at least 109 years old. How are you still alive?
BARS
I was playing this through the surround sound in my living room to get all hyped so the last thing I was expecting were those beautiful ass piano chords. Shit caught me so off guard I was legit frozen in front of my TV for 20 like seconds.. I'm investing in a life alert just in case I fall and can't get up the next time you do that jeezus..
I missed these Frank!
i think frank and tyler the creator should colab üëè
So this is how Pink Guy listens himself and the rest of the world can only listen him say "ey b0oss"?
we need 1:45 - 1:50 on a loop
Like uh
1:10 tyler pls
and that was he's real voice
Frank, here's what I think. I think you're weird as fuck, but creative and original. The pink guy shit is fucking hilarious. That beat made me get really hype. Also, GIMME DA PUSSY BOSS!!!!!!!
Is it just me or are my headphones broken?
Thanks for the new fapping material :^)
smoking kills.
He should go on tour with Odd Future Wolf Gang man. Or better yet join them.
Imagine Pink Guy meeting Eric Andre
+TVFilthyFrank b0ss can we hab the instrumental pls?
This can melt steel beams
Nice vid bro I r8 8/8 m8
god yes
you go the deathgrips route
Nice beard.
Feels so weird to see pink guy with a beard ._.
These videos are why I'm still subbed joji, thanks.
Watching filthy frank is like anal, at first it's scary and it hurts but it gets better the more you get it XD
This tune is too fucking dank, can't wait to hear future ones xD
Put in 1.5 veolocity for a cancer trip
The song was really nice, I missed pink guy a lot xD thanks gogi , happy new year dude
pink guy: i don't speak correctly, but when I do, I drop bars.
Pink guy got style
Anybody else feeling a little bit of a nujabes vibe from this?
My god you never fail to get me giddy for the next video. I understand your reaction to all the "where's the real music" or "are you ok joji" I'd laugh too if someone thought they knew my life. Fuck em frank live on!!!
So papa franku has a shit ton of stuff for actually making music? Shit he is actually really professional at this. Why doesn't he make serious songs i feel he could do some really cool stuff. (Im not saying that this isnt music its great and as a artist myself i respect his stuff a ton)
happy new year faggot
Shit this is good!
This is what drugs do to you
60FPS just what I need.
holy fuck...great beat,nice stable voice and decent flow..i love it
Happy new year papa may good Corey in the house anime come this year!!
You made me think of john Lennon with your glasses :)
Yo new mixtape when
Whatever you call it, I just want you to keep making music. You're really talented, and I hope we get a new album soon.
Unless you're listening to them on a bootleg cd labelled "Pinq Gai" you bougth on the street in Chinatown, Pink Guy songs are as real as any other song.
next time use ganja
dope
kanne westho
Pink Omeguy
I found the cure for Cancer! They say "fight fire with fire" so how about cancer patients just watch your videos?!
This is honestly your best work yet, Papa.
Happy new year, hope for more filthy shit this year! Love the rap bebe :)
Weabooo
this beatnis fatter than me
how is it possible for him to be hot in a pink morph suit
Love You Joji
Hey papa, just wanted to let you know that you do you man. You're probably the best worst channel on youtube (and my favorite, honestly), because your content, while great, is (purposefully) autistic as all hell. I loved this vid, and I'm excited to see what you've got in store for another year of filthy shit. Thanks for a great year.
dud

this is amazing, who filmed the video?
He's just like tyler the creator
dope shit
Can't deny I prefer Franku's "serious" shit by a land slide, but I'm perfectly content with the funny shit because a) it's Frank making it and it's up to him what he does and b) it's still just as fire, no matter how batshit retarded it gets (y)
applauds furiously
Is it just me or him with the sunglasses and pink suit he reminds me of Porco Rosso
tyler the creator?
What a fag.

This shit is üî•üî•üî•
Good job Disney didn't put me in charge of star wars cus filthy frank would have been my choice for kylo ren and this would have been his theme music.
Hi.
I'm just a 16 year old boy who is trying to make it in the rap industry. I'm asking you guys to give me a chance. I know nobody will give me a chance, but if anybody has the heart out there to look at my mix tapes, please do so.
Are you secretly a Chef?
Long time fan Filthy Frank,

This is an example  you've become everything you hate.
This blows. nothing else to say.

Ugh, this video was so last year...
where is the yoji album?
new album when
absolutely fire.
@TVFilthyFrank George/Frank/Joji, I just want you to know as a fan of your music and videos you're an incredible artist and look to be an incredible person overall. I'm musical myself and you give me inspiration for creating music, particularly on the drums and the keyboard. I personally hope you keep the funny shit going and keep the characters alive, but it's your life and your channel man. Do what you wanna do, not what the twelvies and/or other fans want! Always stay true to yourself dude, it's what matters more than anything else! ;)

-Devin
This sounds like some shit Charlie scene from HU would sing
Thats a cool song but your lyrics are too much like "pussy tits dick and stuff" idk if you do it on purpose but if you dont, you should find lyrics about the theme. Like rhymes about rice balls and kitchen in general. Idk you know what i mean but anyway thats cool shit-Stan

Damn, this video made my ass so tight
dawg i love all these videos , fucking great
I think Pink Guy passed through the plain of reality by absorbing Chin Chin and finding his way to the real life Frank, absorbing all characters and becoming the real life Frank himself.
That plot is so good, it's time to make a fanfiction.
This kinda sounded like Tyler, The creator.
Good Shit thought
white tyler
Did anybody else hear BMO say "Finn" as a sound effect in 1:29?
Keep coming back for the lyrics, good shit fam

reminds me of Tyler the Creator, loving it
Ey George, this is really similar to Tyler te Creator song, he inspire any of your material in any way. Track sounds good too.
Pssshhhh I watched this when it was called ONIGIRI. Get on my level 12 year olds.
Yay, music from joji! ^-^
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these

[Verse 2]
This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck your dog I can smack at your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)

[Interlude]
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh

[Verse 3]
I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday" This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role mode;
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave

Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)

[Outro]
(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem
Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video at the same time, you know?
Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time
My first Youtube comment of 2016. God help me....
It's videos like this that make me question his sanity he's a fucking genius
I let my uncle stick my testicals in a horse and I think I popped one
Happy 2016 Franku~
Here's to another year of pure cancer
Yes! this is what we love man. keep cranking out the music. can't get enough of it.

I see Frank has made the strategy of fighting cancer with cancer!
These songs are actually really creative with a lot of good wit. I'll take off my top hat and monocle now and say that again in the language of many of your fans:

Bring back JP 101
Pink guy gets all the pusi.
I was born in the wrong generation! I'm so sick of all the popular main stream music of today. I'm only 15 and I listen to pink guy lay down some sick beats. I can't be the only one who still listens to pink guy.
I want the soundtrack :v
Frankie boy, I've loved your shit since late 2012/ early 2013. You and pink guy and the whole gang make life so much easier. Keep doing your shit, here's to another cancerous year, lets make this one worse.
Dear Filthy Frank:
I fucking hate you.

Love: Dick
HAVE A FILTHY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I fucking love your videos you autistic fucking faggot
This is possibly one of the best beats I've ever heard. And as just about everybody has pointed out, there is sort of an OF vibe here, but that's a good thing.
Thanks for all these videos Frank! Can't wait what you got for 2016.
Good
best intro ever
Normally you're really cancerous and filled with chromosomes, but this really had a chill feeling to it, you're my fake New Years kiss pink guy
I have Lyme disease
I can handle your balls if you can fertilized my eggs.

Keep doing what you love Joji!
Filth Gang till I die nigga
Good video Frank
Nice how-to vid
This is amazing and i genuinely good music, it has good flow and I really enjoy the clever lyrics I wish you the best in you future musical/comedic ventures keep up that creativity - Best of wishes, Doug To: Possibly the best rap artist Ive heard
i fucking love you xD hahahaha
advertising goya and budweiser!!!!!!! oooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love all that George's channel stands for. I think alot of the creativity and thought that goes behind some of these vids/raps, goes over alot of peoples head's. The fact that he's made lore with all the realms etc. It adds so much depth to it all. Seperating all the charecters he's made into their own personalities. Beyond the veil of over the top retardation, is some really thought provoking shit. I  can't imagine the pressure he feels to please the crowd. It sucks he had to break pink guys's 4th wall (heh) and basically say he doesn't give a shit anymore. He's gonna do w.e tf he wants. It's awesome the fact that when he's in one of his charecters he usually sticks with it. Unless he start laughing at how absurd it all is. Idk why i typed this long ass thing but point is if you read this dude, keep doing you. Your  cool af and wish I could crack a beer with ya. Happy new yr and all that ya bunch of fucks.
Franku why change title .  i like onigiri
Filthy Frank: The Modern Picasso (Unappreciated in his time, but will be loved in the future)
Pretty fly dude.
Good beat and verses, loving it.
Keep it up fam

I wish that Filthy Frank was on spotify
This is lowkey lit as fuck
i likked pik guy intil he startd smoekng

These rhymes are too real
That proleteR reference
this song is qwality
Happy new year frank! I love you very much
New album please father
I will never hit the fucking unsubscribe button. NEVEUR
Is it odd that I found Franku this attractive than ever.
It's like Tyler the Creator died and was reincarnated of an autistic white guy
idk why but i would love to see you collab with tyler the creator
i bet filthyfrank would be a nice guy to meet
GOD the filthiness is too real on this video!!!!!! Thank you for laying this giant pile of steaming delicious shit on our plates  papa Franku. Let's see what goodness you can dish out on our faces on 2016. With love, a fan that likes weird shit.
love these vids! Where does Geroge even live?
Awesome :)
Long live Filthy Frank.
pink guy is life pink guys love
This is too serious for me
is this like the official break of the fourth wall
frank>childishgambino
Great video
kinda sounded like a Tyler the creators old version of rapping
Anyone know where or if I can download this sick best
Fuck yes Pink Guy is back!
Why u change the title?
I love to make Onigiri in my spare time so this vid was a dream, Thanks Joji and thanks Pink Guy! I simply adore your newer videos and I must say E.T2 was a visual masterpiece this one also. Though it's a little surreal seeing the vids in HD. I hope you have a wonderful time making new videos and I hope your fans enjoy them for many years to come. Thanks man have a lovely new year. By the way Pink Guy, simply lights up my day with his antics in a positive manner. Oh geez I feel so shy now, whatever muthafucker adios "Incomprehensible Pink Guy Screech"
Bitch why'd you change the name from Onigiri to Riceballs
This is actually fire
You should collaborate with Showry
This shit drops harder than the twin towers
Another album??? Hell yeah.
Sick beat
With all the "kill yourself" stuff and certain parts in your videos I'm starting to think you are depressed and reflecting how you feel about yourself and life. You seem sort of like the depressed clown who goes to the doctor for help and the doctor suggests seeing the clown, he replies "but I am the clown". I hope you're okay, take it easy dude
This is beautiful
this isnt music... this is a masterpiece a cancerous one
This seems like something Tyler The Creator would be featured in ! I love this song so much I would honestly buy ! Please make a album i need you and tyler the creator in my life!!!!
my hero
Yo0o0o0o0ouuuuuUuUuUu dIDENT dew THAAH "itZ FILTHY FREANK" thinG AT thU Ent
Luckily this shit is fire because otherwise he'd have to continue eating these rice balls raw
Oh, lemme in on this beat Papa Franku:
So many different flavors of strange

+ TVFilthyFrank: Excited to see what the evolution of this channel will be. It seems like you keep working to be innovative with it. Keep it up mang.
Does Joji actually smoke, or is it just for his videos LOL
its the best song in 2016 for now (in my country its 2016 for 6 h )
Lyrics plz b0ss
Feel like pink guys flow is comparable that of Tyler creator, I could be wrong but anyway this shit is still flames
What did frank say about internet rapping again?
>2016
>not committing suicide
Big fan of public enemy +TVFilthyFrank ?
I love how much he makes fun of his fans in this
those glasses and beard reminds me of django unchained
dope
Awesome song FithyFrank keep making them plez boss
Who's rapping?
i kinda wanna meet you in person, to see what you are when you arent in a video, and i also wanna know what gives you all these weird or fucked up ideas
shits fire fam
TYBG
ummm doesn't he mean jelly donuts? Pokemon taught me that there is no such thing as rice balls... They are Jelly Donuts! :(
Pink Guy found a high-frame rate camera. The world is a better place now.
the lob part of lobby sounds like black ops 2 zombies
How do I make music like that? I don't have a synthesizer and a group of professional musicians
I love all ur raps ur just smart somethings different gg
Bring back JojiPranksTV
this is like the best fuckin channel on all youtube
can you put this on the spotify for my grandson???
what will kill papa franku first smoking or chin chin
Rapper of the century
But how can be 2016 if world end of 2012
what the fuck even is "real music"? I'll admit to appreciating live instrumentation over DAWs and mixing software, but all music is real music. People just need something to bitch about
Changing the title to cater to the uncultured swines out there. Good Job franku
happy new years papa i hope you get cAncer and have more subs that poods in 2k16
This camera you are using is dope. SLR?
I'm glad he finally addressed his community
franku only makes videos to sell his mixtape
You're the one who called it the "serious album" when you were working on it/planning to drop it after the Pink Guy album, u fukin faget.
EYYYY BABEE ITS NEW YEARS
happy new years
There is a god...that God is....PINK GUY
+TVFilthyFrank me and my friends have been watching your vids for a while now, and we tend to fight who found you first... HahaXD. Anyway, I just wanna say I love your content and I will never stop watching you. You're awesome bro, keep up the good work!:)

Feels like listening to tyler the creator
I fuckin love you frank

Good vid papa.

I love your videos so much!! I hope that you make more, and your videos really helped me though a lot of stuff, I would name it all but do you really want to hear a piece of shit tell you all of 'its' lies, problems, fucked up shit and family deaths? wait... I just told you. well pretend that I didn't say that because I don't feel like deleting all of that... an please don't worry about anything!! be carefree like your on crack, but don't actually do crack.

+TVFilthyFrank, you the realest nigga I know. You are the best youtuber ever, and you fuckin rock bro! could I make a request, and if you could, can you make more COTW and more of your angry rants, followed by Salamander Man, Safari Man, Pink Guy and Chin-Chin making more appearances in your upcoming videos? Could you also when in your rant vids, can you rant about shitty, cringey fandoms, like the five nights at freddy's fandom? If you could do that Frank, that would be fucking awesome. STAY FILTHY FRANK, AND HAPPY FILTH YEAR!
I will see you next time, I will always love you joji

Nice one as always. Keep it real, especially for the new fans :P
As an OG I rate this 10/Onigiri.

LYRICS (THIS IS MY BEST SHOT AT INTERPRETING THEM - IF SOME ARE WRONG, FEEL FREE TO CORRECT ME)
here ya go:

[INTRO] 

lets all go to the lobby
lets all go to the lobby
lets all go to the lobby to get ourselves a drink

[VERSE 1]
welcome to the terradome, the upper echelon
investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals
i'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
i'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
i'm just trying to strangle these - 
this the bleep blop
you make the beat flop
breathing more kush than the sea got
so we got 
the beat drop
harder than your son's balls at 12 knots
and mention that'll be harder than Viagra with a big cock
i'll fuck you in the mouth again
i'll let you know that i'm a schizo, I be hearin' shit
so don't be fucking me 
so bet your ass i'm giving it
(oh) when I get done with you
i'll make sure that your celibate (ewww)
fuck you dog I can smack at your teeth
and i'll fuck you with the radiator pipe
(huh)
(what is that too rude?)

[VERSE 2]

i'm a fucking nuisance with different types of abuses
i'm running up in the premises 
helping you tie an instance
because all of you fucks are cool is
and do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pussies 
like oh
like oh
oh
oh
yeah

[VERSE 3]

I fuck around for money like a cam whore
jerkin to my titties
pop it off on some gay shit 
I fight your dad in the parking lots and or
beat their fucking teeth in because they raise shit
you sound like:

"I NEVER RESPECT MY KIDS, AND I RAISED A PIECE OF SHIT, AND I DROP MY KIDS OFF AT SOCCER PRACTICE EVERY TUESDAY."

oh
this be for all the folks that be dead inside
mini golf champion, you got no drive playa
fuckbois treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
uh
i'm on the cars hoods screaming like a mammal 
rapin' through the flannel 
burn an ass on my chest with the camels
i'm here to be an act, not a role model
don't be fucking crying when I smashin' your kid with a bottle
i'm just chillin, making rice balls
everyday
i'm a simple man
I don't need a microwave (x5)

because i'm already heated (that's not funny) 

[OUTRO]
im pretty fucking drunk right now, i can hardly remember watching this but im pretty sure this is some good shit son
what am i doing som
Keep up the good work üëçüèø
It's been awhile since pink guy rap

i love you papa
I was born in the wrong generation also check out my new mix tape
I'm increasingly convinced that the problem isn't that Filthyfrank is changing, and is instead actually his fanbase that's changing -- because now that Filthyfrank is becoming mainstream, he's receiving much more attention from a much wider and possibly autistic audience than he was when he was simply dizastamusic.

Keep this in mind -- old school frank fans. Keep this in mind. Eventually joji WILL snap, and tell everyone to fuck off.

They always do.

P;S -- if you start making money off these videos, you WILL eventually have to tone down your offensive content. When that toning down becomes clearly visible, that WILL be the death rattle of this channel and a massive exodus from this channel WILL take place with people looking for the next edgy untapped talented youtuber to subscribe to.
im gonna end up using this as a tutorial for riceballs .-.
Keep it filthy in 2016

If 3pac was alive he would diss the shit out of him because joji likes giving hoots to his friends and hang out with his chedda daddies. 3pac will always be the white nigga, not joji

Lyrics are a bit strange but Papa Franku know how to produce a fucking track, sick beat

Lyrical spiritual miracle

jess frank this beat made me hard
That was amazing. Happy New Year to all!

my nigga, real talk.
this is actually really good!
Did Pink Guy and Pink Omega just become one in the same? Also Papa, it's time to be real with you before the potato famine comes to get me. I found your chanel not too long ago. I never thought that anyone could have the balls to do what you do. I know your fans give you shit by pretending to be edgy, but just know that in the end of the day we love you. Now if you will excuse me, the famine is at my door.
Hey Frank, do you work out?
ode
This is great
Frank's videos just aren't as funny as they used to be
OMG.. dude you need to make a rap.. but the background noises are the sounds you make as pink guy (for ex. eyy b0ss)

Who's with me??
Where can I buy this
Nice
Your rapping is shit but your beats are on point. Just make beats. That's what people mean when they say make real music.

Probably my favorite Pink Guy song yet. Its got the same fucked up lyrics we love with a sick beat (not to mention food that looks slightly appetizing) Thanks for a crazy ass 2015, guys.
Fucking bars.
How did this video get 61k likes if only 600 people exist on this world? Obvious fake likes.
Btw Joji don't stop doing what you do, you strange man

Your music are awsome!
Now remember kids if pink guy can smoke you can too
Pink guy is my spirit animal
Cooking like a b0ss
"Ey b0ss or some shit, the twelve year olds think it's funny"

Frankly Franky we'll be impressed when you drop an album with your blatantly exposed dick as the cover art. 

God bless
Another Pink Guy classic. My favorite Filthy Frank, apart from suicidal Mac computer voice.
DAT 60 FPS THOUGH
Wait. WHY DONT YOU HAVE A RICE COOKER WTF I TOUGHT YOU WERE ASIAN
+TVFilthyFrank will there be new episodes of Japanese 101?
those are some really good looking jelly donuts
yeah, I'd pay for this.
Prepare your anus, it's a new pink guy video.

this video answered all the questions you had for filthy frank.
Plz. come to California L.A.
I'm expecting a full PinkOmega album in 2016.
make a video about NEW YEARs
Do you actually smoke Frank/Joji/PinkOmega? Or are they fake?
God damn,the end hit me in the face.
Sick face pubes brah
put that cigarette out young man
why?....
bro I saw all your videos from 2009 on dizasta music and holy fuck man. the best videos are these types of videos.
Maybe alot people say that to you but thats my first time. Of course I don't know real you except videos but you are great guy. I watch you since the video you talk about "shit" all the time I mean I'm not saying to get cocky like some stupid guy "oohh I'm a real filty shit". Anyways thats my first comment to you . I literally laugh at all your videos you are a cool guy. You are the only "youtuber" that I'm interested in everytime I see something related to it. Okay enough of this writing I'm bored I hope you get cancer you filty shit. ..

(Altough if you ever see and answer to this I really want to know what happened to your disease ? Are you totally fine now ? ) 

Finally ; jojivlogs would be so good at a time like this.
Born to early to see the year 3000, born to late to see the dinosaurs roam. Born just in time to watch my Papa Franku <3
Yo frank when you're not throwing up in each other's mouths you spit heavy ass bars that was live
should've left that window open smh
happy new year everyone! <3
this is actually really good
I hope you have a normal life outside of your videos...
we need a needledrop confirmed track reciew
I would go see filthy frank live if he rapped like this live. I love the goofy shit but if he went on tour I would pay.
bars
someone send pink guy to art school.
Why are you such a god
I'm looking to get into film. Need an intern?
Please continue to spread your disease across the world! 

I hope you get to eat all the pussy in 2016 Papa Franku!
This niggas spitting straight wasabi
Why's your house destroyed? ANSWER ME PINKGUY

Rice balls turn me on

The Filthy Frank religion is the only religion that makes sense

Papa I love that 60FPS give me more pink guy smooth groove you know?
I miss the good ol' days when this video was called Onigiri
Another great vid frank. What kinda software do you use for your videos? This looks pretty smooth
Tell me why pink guy can rap in English but when talking he has Down syndrome
I kinda waited to Iggy Azalea suddenly scream "I'M SO FANCYYYYYYYY" but still, it's fucking amazing.
You fucking reptillian fuck
Merry Xmas!
You did it again
The final drop of aids from this year. Hopefully you give me even more in the 666 year.
Love you b0ss, good job sick beats nice mixtape.
Been watching since 2012 and Frank/Joji you're a talented dude with your Filthy Frank videos and you rapping as yourself I love it all. Thanks for making these cancer videos and happy new year

I don't want to sound like a faggot crying over Joji music or shit music or whatever the fuck, but I was wondering If you will continue making sick beats and no rapping, kinda like "Lov U" or "Medicine"...

inb4 shitstorm hits
Thanks papa!
cooking & rapping videos are one the best things about this channel
Pink Guy ft Lil Dicky would be fire like Hiroshima meeting concentration Camps.
I'm not a rappa, so stop rappin' at me.
why did you change the name of the video you hernia
why did you change the name of the video you hernia
This is fuckin' art Frank.

Good job.
1:30 nice chair
That beat is pretty dope.

What a cunty basterd god i luv ya.
Great video papa Franku, but who the fuck cleans all that up?
This is the type of music I need in my life I swear <3
I think it you've hanging around HowToBasic a bit much Papa
Filthy Frank is by far the best thing since sliced bread.
Cancer
checkt out his mixtape
I love your videos, your music, your characters, and you. Still the most entertaining channel on YouTube and the only one I still bother watching. Stay filthy b0ss.
I love your videos, your music, your characters, and you. Still the most entertaining channel on YouTube and the only one I still bother watching. Stay filthy b0ss.

damn, this shits fireüî•
I feel the mixtape coming...
marry me
fuck man
pink guy dance
What a time to be alive
I love delicious jelly donuts!
Simply beautiful in every way sir.
Vape weed everyday
Is this available anywhere besides Youtube?
Someone should make a game of FilthyFrank, there's so much potential, being honest it would be the best cancerous autistic, with amazing music and comedy Game of all time.








Such an amazing game...
Phat rap m8!
HISSSSSS We should leaf a like for the Reptilian Brotherhood
nigger faggot
Between the hard beat, flow and cinematography, this shit is a masterpiece
Did you change the titlle to "rice balls" so we don't think ur a weeb, papa Franku? :D
Love the joji bash
yo pinkman why don't u upload that fuckin instrumental? that shit went hard
That shit looks delicious
There's definitely a market for these beats. Keep this the fuck up.
What are you gay?
I hope you slip your head into a noose and die
Please make more music, you seriously are such a talented musician and please keep it up! love it so much and these are my jam üíñüíñ
I need lyrics...!
part of me wishes frank was a full time musician
I'm offended.
big vid frank gone done it again
–ú–æ–π –ª—é–±–∏–º—ã–π —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —é—Ç—É–± –∫–∞–Ω–∞–ª.
#PinkGuy2When?
Can someone please get the lyrics for this?
That instrumental sounds like DOOM
Do you actually smoke or is it just pretend
we want real music, we want joji music! wuahaha
why did he change the video name?
I want this song to be played at my funeral.
Now I know how to make rice ballsüíñ
All jokes aside, Franku's got some real talent. His lyrics are solid, the flow is easygoing, and it sounds great overall. I actually listen to Frank every day. He's my "Get me functioning in the morning" play list. Then after the morning I continue to listen to it because I make poor life decisions. I actually struggle with atypical depression really bad, so anything I can distract myself with, I use. Frank is one of the best ways to do it. A genuine thank you from me to you, Papa. Keep up the great work.
Can someone make a 10 hour loop of this and pm me the link
make a video on reactionists and how they are the cancer of youtube
I need the instrumental to this song this shit bumps!üî•
omg instrumental please this is beautiful
NOt gon lie beat is dope
Lel I got one of those anti-smoking adds before this video started, whelp papa franku don't give a fuck
10/10 would jerk to again
early.
2016
This is real shit, real hip-hop! Not your skrillshit and WRAPPING. Real hip-hop, don't you ever forget it! Real hip-hop, it's the pink guy that said it!

For real tho, this is some hot fire right here. Keep it up, Franku. See you next year when we get some ebola mixed in this cesspool.
this is bad
Am I the only one who kinda got Tyler the Creator vibes from this?
Is it weird to say that I love him because I hate him
Wat
Put this on Spotify!!!!! Fill my pussy with swag <3
Cam whore lol
Sometimes this show gets more real than anyone expected. Those are the times I get blown away.
having an inner battle with myself trying to decide what is more nasty the beat or pink   meat himself
Frank I believe this is the last meme of 2015.
I was born in the wrong generation. No one in my generation can appreciate this music.
please put this up on spotify
He made it again.
i was born in the wrong generation
WHAT IS THIS
I dunno, I like songs like this but I don't really come for the rapping more so the beats, the real reason I prefer the old Joji stuff like medicine and Lov u is because they were good on their own as beats and didn't need rapping. I mean this is some fine ass shit, but I wouldn't listen to it without the lyrics.
hey b0ss
This song is kinda like a Tyler, The Creator Song or Odd Future song.
are those acual drummachines and samplers? cccccccoooooool
nice ass by the way...
lit
The replay button killed himself
ONIGIRI- BUY IT ON PS4 FOR FREE!
Don't smoke you disgusting, cancerous fetus.

Sick! love it!

No way we can download this and "Pink Guy Cooks Stir Fry and Raps"?
You started making music again? Fuck yesssssssssssssssssss! 
A whole new album b0ss pls
I'm bipolar. please respond

This needs a Grammy award.
I'm going to drop my balls to a countdown on new years!
Pink Guy really needs to clean his fucking feet jesus christ
This was straight up chromosomal fire
So fuckin sick, more rap frank
He raps like he's white. Not good. Like I mean like EVERY YOUTUBE RAPPER. Not my type anyway. Too much Gambino vibe
I will be buying the album on Bandcamp if it sees the light of day.
make a song with tyler the creator or hodge beats or something
love it
"ay yo bring back jojivlogs"
frank being serious? it's just a prank bro
This is art
Hey Franku, when are you gonna do more serious rap songs like this and dumplings etc. I am really looking forward to stuff like that you do some quality rap mate. But focus on your Filthy videos first. They are always really good. Also happy new year to all expecting some good autistic shit from you.
drop the cigs man
That was beautiful!
filthy frank should join odd future
Can you send me your mixtape?
Never cared what name you have. I have enjoyed your shit for years. Have a good 2016 papa franku.

Thank you for all the insanity in 2015! I'm so glad I was shown your channel. While it's very ridiculous, it's also refreshing. It's a nice change from the basic vloggers and such that I see everywhere. Keep being filthy! ^_^
Classic Filth from the realest OG Frank.

I fucking love this comment section
+TVFilthyFrank Good to see you stepping up and saying that this is what you want to do. Too many times I have seen people all "Oh fuck shit fuck man, Joji ain't fuckin' happy with the Filthy Frank Show, he only wants to do Joji, Joji, Joji!! Oh fuck fanboygasm in bound!!!". And don't get me wrong I like the Joji stuff, but I think the people who just want Joji need to realise that this isn't your hell, but your canvas, and you can do whatever the fuck you want with that canvas, Happy new year, looking forward to Chin Chin 2016.
What eq are you using?
WHere the lyrics at ;o ?

I've noticed that franku is in a different apartment. No matter how much you try to hide your normal life Frank,  more people like me will notice changes behind the show. Frank, you should try and do a Q&A about your life. Oh wait, the community doesn't take it seriously
I want to be your riceball man.
holy shit frank at 60 fps, now with double cancer frames
please tell me this is on spotify
i like the song and the beat but i want to download the beat ;-;

When Pink Guy has brief moments of something similar to sanity, he performs musical fucking gold.

Your rap sounds actually realy nice! Usually I don't laugh at videos but your videos are really funny keep up the good work.

Pink guy and tyler the creator should make a song

Frank, the creator is that you?

2016 :)
Shut the fuck up Boomb Beach no one gives a shit
Fuck yes!
10/10
This was fucking amazing!
I take you very seriously and with much respect, FilthyFrank. I was wondering, if someone were to see you on the street, out of character, and wanted to say that they appreciate your work and to keep up the great job, how would they address you in a way to make you comfortable? Like as George, Papa Franku, or what?
this was so tyler the creator inspired
i appreciate ur pritty filthy but u could clean the hob like. stuff like that is what gives ppl e coli
aaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyeeee!! fire.
The discovery of your channel was pretty much the best thing that happened to me in 2015. The crazy, filthy yet heartfelt insanity your videos contain brought many laughter and joy into my sad, irrelevant exsistence and helped me through some tough times. Hope the future and 2016 has many feats of filthiness on it's way.
wait wait wait Pink Omega and Pink Guy can't be the same, Pink Guy can't drop Trap Dumplings
U the realest nigga i know Frank. Great moves keep it up.
What are you fucking gay?
Cancer?
better than ksi
UPLOAD SONG WITHOUT LYRICS!!! <3
AHAHA losers still in 2015, stop living in the past m80s, 2016 is great! spent the first 15 minutes masturbating, now watching this, what a good start for this year
Ahwh this is cute
MUH IMMURSHUN
Real art
beginning reminded me of King of The Jungle, great as always aha you're a talented fuckin musician
was that bmo in the sample?
GIBE THE PUSSY MOTHERFUCKER
Can you release the beat just by itself?
Mr. Filthy, you are the greatest.
song 0% about rice balls but video¬†100%
dirty ass feet
sounds like tyler
YOU SHOULD DO A COLLAB WITH TYLER, THE CREATOR
KSI should watch this. And then he would realize that he sucks.
Miss the tempura boys times......
this somme tyler the creator shit right here
this is super awesome!!!! <3 love u franku senpai
Ey bruh where can I buy yo mixtape?
he could actually be a legit rapper haha
When will a new album from pink guy drop? I need some new music type chromosomes for my ears.
THIS IS NOTHING BUT üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
my parents are divorced
Honestly idc what kind of video you upload, all of them are fucking amazing and crack me up. Favourite youtuber since I saw your weaboo video üíØ I literally check your channel every 12 hours #EyBossIHabbaCancer
CUM CAKE 2016!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
lol this used to be called Onigiri
Can you smoke bleach
Better than KSI
Fucking love this. Thanks for all the shit you put me through this year. Next year will be the year you give me cancer.
noice
I have a feeling frank is just giving less and less of a shit in these videos
üî•
LYRICAL SPIRITUAL MIRACLE INDIVIDUAL
I don't think frank gets that he's a geek show. The jester shouldn't fancy himself a comedian.
1:15 this beat reminds a lot of Nujabes.
This is so fucking awesome seriously I love this! But why did you rename it from Onigiri to Rice Balls?
This has been my favourite channel for several years now, I remember the good old times when DizastaMusic was still small and trying to grow. Your content has genually improved sooo much over the years, every time you make a new video it's usually better than the previous one. Frank/Joji or whatever the fuck you prefer to be called, hang in there bro and just do whatever the fuck you like doing. I enjoy these kinds of video's loads and I bet my ass there are loads and loads of other people that do aswell and as for the people that complain about only wanting video's like "ET2" and "Haircake", just don't listen to them. Tbh, I personally enjoy these vids where it seems you are going back to your roots for a bit.

Anyway, Me and the other fans will be here for you in 2016 Bro. 
Have an amazing new year^^
The original title of the video is gone :(
Whens the new mixtape dropin Jon Favreau
why'd you change the song name?
Man, I think you're a genius!
We love papa frankuuu!!!
YES, more of this.
this guy is pretending to invented the gangnam dance

Filthy Frank is not even trying and he has a better vibe and raps better than KSI lmao, and that nigga is releasing stuff left, right and center but it's not good I feel, this on the other hand, damn and those beats!!

( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
All these people complaining about Isis. What about the millions who die of smoking every year?
fesher shiat bru
Your fanbase worships you Papa Franku. Just keep producing cancerous videos and don't sell out and we will continue to worship you
noob frank
best one yet! :)
kaybouse
So Pink Guy and Pink Omega really IS the same person!?!?!?
Awful production
New album, please
OMG frank you're a fuckgn God bro, you need to be God of some religion
The ending statement just completed the video, he makes good shit in whatever fucking 'form' he takes but kids always want the disgusting shit (which is great don't get me wrong) so it can help them believe that they're fucked up then talk to their friends about it at school. Btw smokings bad mmkay.
this shit is lit
THAT EPIC RICEBALL THROW THO
shit frank shave that pussy hair you're growing on your face
nobody is going to buy your mix tape. faggot.
best thing on the internet
Thanks for being my autistic god frenk. luv u.
I'm fucking proud of Joji right now...

Like, I'm moving to Eastern Europe on the 4th of January (it's the 30th of Dec right now), if I had a last wish before I never come back to America again - it'd be to chill with Joji for a day, an hour, whatever. I support this channel so hardcore right now, I think I might fly my non-stop flight into a building or something while screaming "Frankuuu!". (dramatization)
Papa, I think my bass went into overdrive and I appreciate you for that. I hope you make Another One sometime. p.s and maybe Another One
this is some real shit fam
i love these simple, but sick-as-fuck beats that you make. it's actually the reason i kept watching and became a fan.
Damn frank, you should focus more on rapping man, this was some good shit!
I love your jazzy-fusion style. did you take inspiration from Nujabes or Kool G Raps or Black Moon. Even though this isnt a sing that may be relevant to society, you are a good lyricist and your style is fucking beautiful. If you made some music and rapped under a different alias i would buy that shit. Anyway, fuck you faggot. Welcome to 2016.
This brought such a huge fucking smile to my face. Thanks for the great year Franku.
ey b0ss can I habe de pusi pls?
I put ice cubes in my milk
Onigiri was a better title. »òO
I die now
actually is ono/lennon's  bastard son
THIS IS GREAT BUT TOO SHORT SENPAI , DAMN I REALLY WANT TO STAB YOU WITH MY SWORD FROM SWORD ART ONLINE
Clean up your room  you fucking dirty cunt tumor.

Loved this song,it was so lit
That was real shit
for real tho, this beat is pretty great!
God , I love Joji.
I was waiting for this beat for two years. Thanks Papa.
starting to wonder if he really does have schizophrenia...if he is then he's definitely like me, schizophrenic myself and i love to be other characters of my creation because it means i dont have to be me. its a great way to express yourself and live through such a shitty disorder.
great video, song dank af.
Pink guy WAS Jimmy Saville. Huh.
papa franku san, do you smoke weed? im actully curious
jojivlogs hype?
Thanks frank you the real homie
Where's the ending, the subscribe to filthy frank part and the 'let's get some pussy tonight part' they're my favorite !
Can we expect a future mixtape?
Phucking Phire Dude !!!
I started smoking because of you, I'm literally going to get cancer thanks to your videos. Fuck you.
Why does pink guy have a beard
Happy new years retards.
Franku makes the beat drop like old people with polio
flames
Shit didin't Change
fuck me
now
That 60fps art.
you  have a neak-beard frank
You're smart, You're loyal you'r a genius
Hey Frank, you talk about things you don't like or what's wrong with certain topics alot. So why don't you give us fans a video about the music you LIKE to listen to. Serious with Joji or just Frank fucking around and bashing on a ton of music. I think it would be a great video topic and something we would all enjoy.
p.s. I love the song keep the music coming, the regulat videos are great but I need more pink guy to bless my hearing hole.
I need to download this song. üñï
Thanks Dad.
Boy I got that Rock hard Johnson
Fuck off let him smoke if he want. Your not going to change hes way of smoking. He probably knows that smoking is bad. Mind your own fucking business. ( sorry not sorry for the bad english )
Hey frank, I think some lines went way too far, even for you. Overall this was a great video, major props to the cinematography and the honest commentary at the end, but saying you raise a piece of shit kid if you didn't physically punish them felt like a serious remark instead of a joke, so that's why it's so offensive. I'm a psychology major in college, and I can positively say your implications have no grounds in reality whatsoever.

If it's a joke, ok, I can dig dark humor. If not, maybe you should go slit your wrists.
this stopped me from cutting my self and posting it on tumbler
Man, those jelly filled doughnuts look great! Nothing beats a jelly filled doughnut!
entering 2016 with autism
This is the best recipe on youtube
thanks daddy
I legit didnt know Frank could have such a smooth voice, i was starting to belive that the raspy voice is your real one
Emimen < Franku
Emimen < Franku

This fanbase has become progressively worse in a bad way since I subscribed. Too many 12 year olds which make it seem cringy. Sad times...
what is the meaning of life ?
based God some dank shit
Honestly I prefer this over the shitty "ohshitI'msogrosegivememoney" vids he started making at the start of this year. Papa Frank, Please go back to doing more content like this. I't much more interesting and funny, coz all those colabs you did with those other youtubers were super unoriginal and were done just for the sake of getting more views(in my opinion)... Or maybe you just like eating hair you sick fuck.
life
The only rap is listen to honestly.
joji you are the fucking man.
he's actually quite a talented producer and rapper ngl
Onigiri daisuki des gohan master
i dont even have to watch the video to know that it is fucking amazing

That apartment so shitty HowToBasic came to make a video and went "Wait did i do this place already?"
That apartment so dusty Pink Guy's feet got black walking from the bathtub to the kitchen, but that's not all bad cause
 he can run faster now.
Seriously joji, your stuff is dope. Make music if that's your passion cause it's really good mane, keep it up

If there is anything that I learned from this channel it would be how to cook
I like wiping my ass to franks music

Oh god...that beat is just sick, dude! I love that piano part. Love this song, hope you can make another album in 2016. Thanks for all your retarded stuff!
My first time watching this. Of course, I have to be stoned.
Regrettably it made more sense, on a sort of metaphysical way.
fake like cancer, gay ass lip sync
Papi smokes?
Here how bout a cigarette? üö¨ (gives you cigarette), then (slaps it out of your hand and pick it up of the ground then smokes it) üòóüö¨ cigars are bad for you
This stuff is fire, pink guy seriously needs to come out with some kind of mixtape.
BEST

dayum the production value just increased tenfold, just as my autism did :D
Realist tune of 2015

My house burned down when I played this !!

Best song 2015

Please tell me you don't actually live in that house...
New album?
good to see you back at it
Hapy NEW YEAR
Is it just me or was that fucking fire...
Frank's and Pink Guy's looks in these last two videos seem to be a bit altered, I wonder if this is the canon look for both characters now. Also, was the message at the end a hint to something coming in the future? Either way, awesome video, the recent quality is an improvement.
"Lobby" sounds really creepy
Best Channel since 2012 

i luv u papa franku

CHIN CHIN GADAISKI

The white Tyler, the Creator
We really need a new Pink Guy Album. Your talent mustn't go to waste.

Dank rice washing skills yo.
Fuck your rice balls
That chair doesnt have a sitting board,is that some special Pink Omega chair?
Did Frank change the title?
But that beat tho, it could be cool if you could release an instrumental version of this. :P
I am guessing that the smoking was just a prank
more rap.
where did you buy the pink guy suit at?
this beat is orgasmic.
i like the first 25 seconds
can we get this beat by its self. or the whole song on soundcloud.
mfw I found out papa franku invented harlem shake back in 2012
he's back
Why did you change the title from Onigiri? Just wondering. I googled Onigiri learned something!
There better be more of these cancerous, dank beats in 2016, Frank. Thanks for making 2015 one of the most filthiest years of my life.
Why didn't bethesda add this in fallout?
stop smoking #2016
Nice nigra beats brah. We turnt up now.

Shit dude, the track is extremely good. Defo a large inspiration for me.

The Odd Future influence is apparent in this track.
1:45 to 1:51 was prime

Lord Chinchin wanted pink guy for his tasty ass beats

Pink Guy x Keith Ape x Okasian x KOHH x Dumbfoundead 2016 make it happen
Ewwwwww you smoke cigarettes? Might want to stop that before you get cancer, actual cancer...
1:24
Is that BMO calling Finn?
Everyone should just tweet this video at Tyler, The Creator so that they can collab!!!!
This is really good. Sounds like legit music (almost sounds like ofwgkta lyrics). I like the mention that he's not here to be our role model because I'm sure he gets a lot of complaints from people saying that his videos are taken too far when they're not even meant to be taken seriously. Great work as always, papa Frank, keep it up!
So I gave my son a small loan of a million dollars for this?

What the fuck.

-Bill Gates
Lets all go to the lobby and buy some riceballs
rip filthy Frank he died from lung cancer
I actually learned something from this. Bombest recipe tutorial ever
who's watching this shit in 2016?

smoking is smoking is smoking
Don't apologize for being real, especially when that's what people think they want.  People want to hear about you personally so they categorize what they must think that is as "real music." The breaking of character essentially. At the end of the day especially when it comes to rapping as long as the content is creative and flows I don't understand the problem. Everything within context has a point, whether or not it's recognized.
nice song, but clean your stove top
That soul patch doe
Pink guy with some more dope flow. Looking forward to 2016
2015 was the year of papa franku.
I had a dream. Frank was my uncle. It was awesome.
love the music

it's gr8

prolly gonna listen again
This is Art.
Was expecting cancer. Ended up with my family dying in a mysterious house fire...
Does Frank monetize his videos?
DJ Khaled better step it up
Hey, that's pretty good!
Aye b0ss, drop me that mix tape 2016 ;o

frank is my spirit animal
Jeez frank wanna lay off the cigarettes?

FUEGO
Dude, you do you man. Like I'm sure people have known that the shit you do and say is just social commentary with a comedic twist, so keep at it.
what camera frank
I really love this grimy bass heavy beat man.
Your house is fucking disgusting.
Nice
Was Tyler the Creator in that tub helping you with the production on this one b0ss?
the realest
I want rice balls now.
Punk guy needs his own channel
Yeah fuck joji music we got pink guy here
Oh damn Bruh that's fire
sounds like a beat you would hear on adult swim
The only thing that would make Frank more cancerous is if he used vaporizing cigarettes
This is beautiful
this is fuckin sick. I get a real Tyler, the creator vibe (from his early stuff), but I mean that in a good way
Sound like ofwgkta
¬Ø\(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø
amazing
Puff Daddy doesn't have shit on your production skills
Beard
Dropping bars like Nagasaki!
Hey frank do you know how to make mochi

the shots and the music man just 10/10
those balls are nasty
is there any chance of getting Pink Guy on Spotify?
I love you Joji, your music is fucking delicious
Dude this was dope keep doing this shit fuck everyone else i like all content you put out. Not a kiss ass but just appreciate all the shit you do and create.
Im 1 year old and I have to say that this is the real music, they don't make these kind of music anymore. wish more people from my generation would respect this. man,this generation sucks #thuglifepinkguy. he is spiritual, lyrical, miracle, individual #realhiphop
Hey... That's pretty good
damn this shit is fire, lyrics?
This beat is actually... pretty hot
Thank god
I fucking love this no joke Joji babe fuck me.
There are people who call these raps "not real music?"  What qualifies as that?  Top Ramen and Fried Rice drops some serious hammers, what does it matter to them if there's footage of you cooking added to it?  How does that detract from their impact?-when no bitches find them attract-or, Old MacDonald faggot fronting as a ladies man? Nah they're just an actor, a little fudge packer
I'M A SPIRITUAL LYRICAL INDIVIDUAL MIRACLE SPIRITUAL MIRACLE LYRICAL INDIVIDUAL MIRACLE-
pls rap more
ZWHY DID YOU CHANGE THE NAME FROM ONIGIRI Y
nigoris.
You've been my favorite YouTuber since 2012. I doesn't matter to me what name you go by, what channel you're on, or what type of videos you make, I love it all. Thanks for a fucking crazy 2015, and I hope the future holds even filthier shit. Thank you for being the most cancerous, autistic, and disease ridden channel on YouTube. If you can even call it a channel.
0/10 didn't feel like a fever dream.
Love the slow mo
Did Joji say Killer Whales?
UNDER WATER SQUAD.
Well time to make a new edit...
i... i was eating onigiri while watching this... i don't think i'm ever going to cook it ever again in the same way.
delectable beats once again
Still something so white and pussyish I feel in that beat, I don't know why
Oh deng a noo pnk gai rap
"Hey that's pretty good" - idupes
Tyler the creator?
Hey, that's pretty good.
Maybe people requesting "real music" only want a decent beat with sensible lyrics, just saying. Sure, I was entertained when I watched this, but I would really like to hear a serious song by Joji/Pink Guy/Pink Omega/Franku because he clearly is at least somewhat musically gifted.
Yo guys Youtube Explained just uploaded a video explaining FilthyFrank.
prankd
you should have a contest for people to make dances to your songs. either way I want to do it for fun regardless cause it would make for some great moves  with these dank beats and lyrics
Let's all go to the lobby.
best 2015 song.
You seriously need release these instrumentals!
sjukt tung ass√• hahahha
Im ready for the day when I see a news article about a man in a pink suit found dead in the street with a heroine needle in his arm
I fucking love you, Frank.

Why did he change the name?

Still better than anything Iggy could make
You should post more music considering that you're awesome at it and it sounds sweet. Well you can post whatever you like to post i know i love all your content and so do many others, i just wanna see all the great things you can do.
Eating and smoking at the same time? B0ss..you have a cancer now.
filthy frank is the best :)
Better than all the songs in the radio
sounds like Tyler the Creator
edgy
I'm glad to see this. Fan base should never force the entertainer into styles they don't enjoy.

I think frank finally upgraded to 60fps and learned to edit in slow motion. Can't wait to see all the HD shit this channel produces.

Wtf
hey Frank, nice vid love it! but for your own sake... please stop smoking... I'm not being one of those troll fags who wears fadoras and likes trump I'm just saying stop smoking for your own good. last month my dad died of lung cancer from smoking, and u have helped me through these hard times by putting a smile on my face when I think about going and seeing my dad. so for your own health, please stop smoking... :)

my brother walked by and was like "are you watching one of them cringe compilations?"
U a real nigga mayne
Love you
you should make a sound cloud
Your music is pretty bomb man. I really do enjoy the food on the side, it's nice. Technically as long as there are lyrics and a beat you are making music. And if you pay attention to the words there is a deeper meaning in it all. Trap Dumplings was the easiest to get the message from. At the end of the day I would like to see the real you in more vids. But these faggots and their fourth wall bullshit...
Love that song!!
When your frank you honestly sound weird but pink guy raping sounds really fucking cool
Tyler the creator flow
why is this so chill?
Frank you shouldn't smoke you might get cancer.
So apparently Frank's definition of "new vid coming soon" is a fucking week
love it
Best rapper everüëèüëèüëè
Franks real name is George Miller
Raw Meat üî•
That was awesome. I hope you keep trying new sounds

cuz all of you fucks are clueless,
and do not know how to do this,

then put my fingers in pusses,
like 'Oh',
like 'Uh',
Oh.

Yuh.

I fuck around for money, like a camwhore,

'I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit,
and I drop my kids off at soccer practice erry Tuesday'
Oh,

many golf champion, man, you got no drive, playa.
Fuccboiis,

I only work with paper, like a fax machine.
I'm on the car's hood, screaming Micheal Mammal,
whippin' thru the flamable, 
burn on NASA,
playin' chess with the Camels.

I'm here to be an act, not a role model,
don't be cryin',
when I'm smashin ya kid with a bottle,
I'm just chillin', 
makin' rice balls,
ERRDAY.
I'm a simple man,
I don't need a microwave (x4)

Looks like someone got a new camera
You actually have a really good rapping voice no joke!

HAn sOlo GreAtESt
These mad lyrics though, really nice. I wonder how much people actuially listened to them
You're a legend, man
Oh, I missed Pink Guy's raps about Japanese food. Thank you
This video is proof that we evolved from apes
I've been waiting six months for this.
how did you get chance the rapper to feature with you?
i love how unmastered music sounds. this is beautiful
Nice 60 fps b0ss
There no "let's get some pussy tonight" at the end.
TUNA IN RICE BALLS? EW

Smoking gives you cancer b0ss
Yes
Better than Tyler.

Holy shit people. You people over look things to much in an attempt to be deep or something. He's chillin.
That made my day
This actually isn't such a shitty video when you're drunk

The culinary rap series, the best series
So that's where the sample came from.
It's back!!! Hell ye
this is just so relaxing
im going to kill myself to this song
Killer whale cohort üò∑
Fire,  thanks dad.
Franku is the most cultured person of our time
last time I came this early my dad yelled at me
Is it sad that this rap's lyrics make more sense, are more sophisticated, and that the rap is just overall better than any one I've heard on the radio in the past 2 years?

.............
Drake and Iggy need to watch out. Pink guy is here to steal their thunder.
.......... I don't know why I enjoyed this drivel.
Funny, but he really shouldn't be smoking.
you gonna be the next Kendrick Lamar?
A1 autisim
Also you have my support for your music man...I don't care if you're pink guy or Joji...you make good stuff and as a consumer all genres of music I recognize good stuff when I hear it...if you're happy making videos...I'm happy to watch and listen...
fuckin stellar, pink

Fuck man your house is so messy. (I have OCD

That riceball impact was the 3rd Impact from Evangelion, worlds gonna turn into Tang any moment now.
This made me so fucking hard
Hey do you have mixtape boss?
Nigger faggot
Does frank actually make this music? i dont mean the lyrics XD
Never had a riceball before.
Sounds a bit like earl sweatshirt at times
Frank should make a song with Tyler, The Creator.
My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him,'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately.Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said tome- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put yourfamily through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 18, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this post gave me cancer anyway.
Odd future-esque?
Papa's starting to turn into a real man now. I like these physical changes.....
it's seems Frank is disappointed that more and more kids are watching his channel
The quality is so good its scaring me.
la la la bi bi la la la bip bip
smoking is bad for you b0ss
you renamed the song to rice balls y
b0sssssssss I don't give a living SSHHHHHEEEEYYYYAAAAATTT if you fucking upload pink guy shit or joji shit, I just want any kind of shit from you. E.T. 3, not serious raps, serious raps, cooking raps, rants. I luv u either way MENG!!!! Keep making shit. Any shit from you is good shit, and if people don't think that, they can go fuck themselves in the mouth with a taser. Also my mom says I have ADHD/ADD because I act just like you. Thank you for teaching me to be someone.
anyways b0ss, fuk u meng.
This is why he get da pussy

This was fucking bumpin!!
I really can not stop listening to this
sometimes i forget your a real person and this reminds me in a way that you still exist
this was fucking great
That Tyler the Creator tweet Frank made stands. This is also very Tyler the Creator-y.
Franku-sama spitting that STRAIGHT FIRE!!! 

This is the BEST music. I love MY generation!!!
Is anyone else genuinely worried about papa Franku? He smokes and it looks like he drinks a lot and his apartment is complete shit. Not that it's any of my business I Just feel like he should benefit more from what he does
frank smoking isnt allowed in the apartment nono
A lot of skin tight dick showing I this video....
i demand lyrics
Safari man and JP101 is long over due! Hope you have one planned soon! Thanks for the old school Pink Guy!
Love it!!!
I fucked my parents and burned down my house.
How much for a beat produced by Pink Guy? Shit go hard though.
this shit is so fire I had to move to Illinois cause my house burned down
dont even read past the top comments honestly save yourself the trouble lmao
I'm betting he didn't intend to break character at the end and go on that rant but then he said fuck it just leave it in. Good call actually.

Never fail to entertain me. Keep at it PapaFrank!!
Too bad I was born in the wrong generation, because now i'm stuck wanting Frank/Joji/Pinkguy to drop a new album so I can buy the fuck out of it.
waiting for someone to upload a lyrics video so I can rap this art

Continue this~

Gimme da Gimme da Gimme da~
I'm listening to this hours on end.
Fucking weeb.

I noticed Frank's smoking habit is progressively getting worse throughout his videos.
Shit got fucking real there at the end
I was born it the right generation. screw that old generation bullshit. the 2015's are the best.
comical yet truthful
Worst song out of all of yours, please hang yourself on new years.

Sometimes I think Joji looks at the majority of these comments and cries a little.
THAT SHIT WAS FUCKING LIT NO WAY

Joji, do you love me the way i love you?
Jesus Christ. This is the best song he's released to date. I don't care what kind of music Pink Omega/Pink Guy/Joji/Whatever the fuck else people wanna call him makes, as long as he does it I'll be happy because this fucker has talent.

Listening to the beginning of the ramen rap out loud in public is great, you should try it Frank((:
Thanks Pink Guy, this video finally solidifies my decision for committing suicide.
+TVFilthyFrank can you rep my mixtape
Onigiri is rice balls.
Fuck all the autistic 12 year olds. This is dope
IT'S LIT !!! üòÇüíÄüôäüí•üí•üí•
Dope
Does he really smoke or does he do it for entertainment? If he does it for entertainment, he does it so frequently that it's like smoking regularly lol.
Jorgi dat you bro?
My cancer is spreading b0ss.
ey b0ss
Pink guy has been spitting so much fire in all these raps that he's probably a Charizard at this point.
Pink guy:Hey boss, 
Filthy frank:yeah

This is dope, it's been awhile since the last song, and this blows the last one right out of the water great work man keep it up.
Holy shit now you sound like a true new york nigga
I like how Frank changed the title from ONIGIRI to RICE BALLS.
Sickest beats
FilthyFrank strikes again! Frank > 2Pac
Bruh your house is dirty. Fire your cleaning lady shes terrible.
fuck me!!!! your gay
Way better than Eminem
Thanks for dropping this even though you're not obligated to do shit for anyone. You keep doing you, boo. ‚ù§
I find it amazing that at first Pink guy was sort of a juvenile side music project.
I can't tell if it's the new camera, smoking, songs, or the fading of the suit but this seems a lot more mature and serious.

I love it.
You know depression is hitting you hard when you start smoking cigarettes
I'll be honest this was actually a really instructional video on how to make rica balls, great work pink guy üòä
I don't need a microwave!
You could seriously become a rap artist.
Their called jelly donuts.
Quality shitpost lad
Is this One Punch Man season 2?
can i use your music for my videos cause you make good beats
this was actually pretty good... not as "how fucking edgy can we get tip tip" like the latest vids
im diggin it
Eminem be like, who the fuck is this homo. Pink Guy just licks Em's face thus stealing all is Chi. All of Em's chi gets absorbed in Pink Guys butthole.
The normal human way to put it, Pink Guy raps like eminem and probably would still call Pink Guy a homo. #MomsSpaghettiVsRiceBalls
üëΩayy lmao
Yo, joji/frank/pink guy whatever the fuck ppl call you. This is the realest shit you ever made ;D i salute you
That was some dank shit right there... Loved it
Go to bed
Does this have a mp3 already?
These beats are sicker than a boy with cancer.
Some of the rapping reminds me of lil dicky
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Why the title change? Onigiri is the same thing, right?
hey, thats pretty good!
So when is Pink Guy going to win a Grammy?
My knees are shiny under the light
Is this on soundcloud?
Dank
I love it when you make videos like this. Its you expressing and saying what you need to say and having an air of fun about it. Great work as always.
next pink guy ep coming soon?

WTF is happening to this channel,Please do funny weird stuff again.. This is scary weird stuff
I was trying to get the lyrics to this song but some of them dont make any sense. Please do comment if you can make these lyrics better.
Here is what i got

Welcome to the tether dome 
The upper agilone investing on these large balls 
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the japanese 
Killer whales, humpbacks and narwhals 

I'm just tryna strangle these fuckers 
I'm just tryna strangle these fuckers 
I'm just tryna strangle these... 

This the beat drop 
You make the beat flop 
Even more cushion than the seat got 
We got the beat dropping harder than your sons balls at 12 
Not to mention we harder than the viagra and the big cock 

I'll fuck you in the mouth again 
I'll let you know im a schizo i be hearing shit 
So dont be fucking me cos bet your ass im giving it 
When i get done with you i make sure you are celibate 

I'm a fucking nuisance with different types of abuses 
I'm running up in the pharmacy helping you tie your nooses 
Cos all of you fucks are clueless and don't know how to do this 

I fuck around for money like a cam whore 
Jerk it to my titties pop it off to some gay shit 
I fight your dad in the parking lot 
And or beat their fucking teeth in cos they raise shit 

This one's for the folks that be dead inside 
Mini golf champion you got no drive playa 
Fuck boys treat my dick like a trampoline 
I only work with paper like a fax machine 

I'm on the cars hood screaming like a mammal 
Whipping trough the flammable 
Burning nasol on my chestplate like camels 

I'm here to be a axe not a role model 
Don't be fucking crying when i'm smashing your kid with a bottle 
I'm just chilling making rice balls erryday 

I'm a simple man i don't need a microwave 

I don't need a microwave 
I don't need a microwave 
I don't need a microwave 
I don't need a microwave 

Cause im already heated
Papa Franku, tell Pink Guy smoking is bad.

Dude that was fucking sick!! Keep it up man!!

0:24 UFO Caught on Tape . ET 3 Confirmed

Frank's comment message took the bad taste out of my mouth from this video 

A weird shape of good
Pink Guy in 60FPS ohohoOHOHOohoh b0ss
Lotsa fun. Better ingredients. Better Rice Balls. Papa Franku's.
Your voice is beautiful Pink
Goddamn these bars are so hot they can melt steel beams!
first
I think Frank really brings new things to the table in this track. The use of an intermission "Let's All Go To The Lobby" jingle is really creative, however short the sampling may be. Overall, the beat is well put together and surprising, to say the least, from an independent artist like Frank. The vocals are supported by the beat nicely, and they feel as if they belong there, and not like they were forced there. The vocals sound as if they're a part of the instrumental themselves, and it adds to the flow of the song nicely. The lyrics leave not much to be desired, they are well rounded and provide good insight to multiple different topics. This isn't one of my favourite tracks from Frank so far, but it's definitely one of the best objectively. I only have two questions about this recent song: why is my dog losing hair, and when will my parents love me again?

I'm feeling a strong 7 to a light 8 on this one
I'm a spiritual miracle lyrical individual lyrical spiritual individual
WE WUZ REAL MUSICS AND SHIT
t. Franco Sujo
Pink Guy Album 2 would be great with even more rapping because your flow is really nice

I've been "following" you since diazastamusic. I found pink guy and the sketches and the chromosomes shit funny, I then found your soundcloud and listened to "medicine" a shit ton. Then I kinda started to like this music ^^^ stuff more. So all I'm saying, is that you do have people following you who I guess you could say have a change in pass similar to yours. We're not all 12 year olds screaming "ayy b0ss"
what are you? a fucking faggot?
fresh goatee u fucking cunt
Onigiri
Frank is becoming dangerously good at filming theese
Now Frank with those cigarettes you really will get cancer

Ayyy... what areyah... fuckin............ gay
my diet is now rice and cigarettes thanks to this song
I make rice in the microwave

What's the instrumental?
Aw why did you change the name?
I would've at least seasoned the tuna a little bit, slap sum mayo in it, then through sum onions and relish into the tuna. After that I'd put it in the rice balls.
My school says smoking is bad

to be frank with you frank (sorry kill me) I actually prefer these kind of music videos then "real" music videos and at the end I completely understood ya it is still music at the end of the day and you can still be all wild while making a decent music video so do continue making these kinds of videos it's what your good at love ya babes <3

Of course this dumb cunt would smoke cancer sticks.
This song had a very OFWGKTA feel on it haha
The song gave me a mega erection
I was born in the wrong generation, God please give us back Tupac and take away this faggot, i'm 15 and i listen to REAL music kms
when the beat is actually fire
"PINK GUY V2" 2016 album incoming!?!?
Please add corrections below i tried my best :P

Lyrics:

welcome to the ??? tone, the upper echelon,
investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches whalen' like the Japenese,
killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals,
I'm just tryna' strangle these fuckers,
I'm just tryna' strangle these fuckers,
I'm just tryna' strangle these- this the beepblop
you make the beat flop,
breathing more kush in than the ???,
so we got,
the beat droppin' harder than your sons ball at 12,
not to mention that we harder then viagra with the big cock,
I'll fuck you in the mouth again, 
I'll let you know that i'm a skit so I be hearin' shit,
so don't be fuckin' me cuz' bet your ass I'm hearin' it,
when I get done with you I'll make sure that you're celibate,
fuck your dog I can smack at your teet,
and I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe (What is that too rude?),
I'm a fuckin' nuisance,
with different types of abuses,
I'm runnin' up in the premises,
helpin' you tie your nuces,
cus all of you fucks are coolest,
and do not know how to do this,
I act retarted on stage and then put my fingers in pusses,
like oh,
like oh,
oh,
oh,
yeah,
I fuck around for money like a cam whore,
Jerk its in my titties,
pop it off on some gay shit,
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or,
beat their fuckin' teeth in cus' they raised shit,
you sound like,
"I never respect my kids, and I raised a piece of shit, and I drop my kids off at soccer parctice every tuesday",
this ones for the folks that be dead inside,
mini golf champion you got no drive player,
fuck boys treat my dick like a trampoline,
and i only work with paper like a fax machine,
I'm on the cars hood screaming like a mammal,
rippin through the flammaburn and ????????? with the camels,
I'm here to be an ass not a rolemodel,
don't be fuckin cryin' when I'm smashin' your kid with a bottle,
I'm just chillin' makin' rice balls ery' day,
I'm a simple man I don't need a micro wave,
I don't need a micro wave,
I don't need a micro wave,
I don't need a micro wave,
I don't need a micro wave cus I'm already heated (that's not funny),
(we want real music, we want real music we want Joji music)
bro I didn't even know real and fake music exsisted,
I mean I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories,
like music is music and if you don't think this is real music that's your fuckin' problem,
like who says I can't drop shit while makin' a culinary funny video at the same time,
you know, whatever man,
it's your boy pink guy, pink omega whatever you wanna' call me I don't give a fuck
still doin' that wacky crazy shit ain nothin' changed,
so see you next time
Tittle name changed
this reminds me of when music was actually good and when the japs were still imperialists
#1945skids
fucking god
Shit, stop eating my children.
new theme song
Who taped your pubes to your chin as a dare?
2COOL4U92 hi there fellow breakdancer
You know, I never really thought of the PinkGuy stuff as "fake" music and "joji" shit being "real". The phrase "real music" doesn't even make any sense.  Maybe by "real" those people meant like "more insightful/sober" shit rather than the brag-rappish type stuff. I personally like the majority of whatever this guy releases at the end of the day~
their is beer in every room that you filmed in there
real or fake its way better then danger music and that chick how made baby doll
this is the type of shit why I subscribe to this guy he is fucking amazing
this is some hot fire cunt
BIG MAMA IS STILL HIS BEST TRACK
This song is quite good, as the kids would say its "dope as fuck"
Why change the title?
the 60 fps is too beautiful
Shave off that disgusting excuse for a beard.
keep up the flames eb0ss, been wit the shit since day one brah brah (;
I can't wait to sacrifice to Chin Chin again.
This is not real music. It's transcended.
Franku, my dick is on fire, why did you drop this fire while I was masturbating?
Last
Honestly, I think you should make a seperate series where you just sit down and talk about whatever topic you want. It would give you room to add humor and be serious. Just sit down and talk to the camera about literally anything.
This was flames lmao
that beat murdered me, it stepped out of my screen and grabbed my eye drops and shoved them into cornias, so deep that when the beat pulled it back, my eye came out, it jumped in and started ripping out vital parts of my brain. Then slowly came all over my cracked skull
that 60fps looks sexy
burnt my house down üî•
"I act retarted on stage but then put fingers in pussies" LMAO
A E S T H E T I C
chunge et bak 2 onigiri fgt
Holy shit 60fps
I actually liked this video xD
This gave me chills.
Guys its okay if he smokes, he already has cancer
frank just stop. stop just stop it just stop frank
So pink guy and pinkomega WERE the same person huh, who would've thought
Why did u change the name from onigiri  to rice balls
That ending message o dam
God I hope you tell us the source of the beat (as in the individual shit)
he need some milk
This is gay, sounds like typer the behavior smh , u suk l0lz. 


Jk, dis reely gud s0n
Making music in the bathtub? What are you fucking gay??
ITUNES PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This song had more of a Tyler the Creator type tone to it. I enjoyed it quite well.
I wouldn't be mad if there was a separate channel just for Pink Guy's raps...
Can't wait for that mixtape
Peter Joseph from 'The Zeitgeist Movement' is acting strange in this video.
Raw, raw raw meat, meat meat
Little chorus with all the beautiful chords was amazing but the rest was sort of poopy
Rice Balls.
this is too dank
Am I the only girl that watches him daily?
When will this Frank drop the album tho?
After 300000000 chromosomes Frank and Joji are becoming one being once again
Bars
Another dope beat.
Finally after a year. I've been waiting for this to drop
YEP ITS CONFIRMED, PINK GUY IS THE REAL STREET CHEF
pink guy really looks like franku in those glasses.
Nice upload Frank. Throwing it back to the Pink Guy Album.
lobby
Made my nipples itch.
Dank
Nicely made video man. Next album when?
322 NEVER FORGET #4Head
An instant classic. Happy New Year my Filthy King.
You know there were times in this video when i thought you were legitimately cool but in the end my opinion still remains that youve changed for the worse although i do support the message of this video
I'm going to make sure this plays in my gym
Hey Frank, any chance you'll be releasing only the beats ? They're amazing
PINK GUY IS MY GRANDMAS EX WIFES COUNSLER
I forgot what stage is this? Do you have a soundcloud
I'm really digging these tracks, you really bring a new style.

I like the colors in this video
I love all the inferior music videos recommended to me at the end of this masterpiece
I wonder if Franku actually made this while sitting in the tub
I have prolapsed my soul with this beat.
Thank God I've watched this shit in 2015 boooi!
This shit is lit
Pink Guy in 60fps be givin' me more wood than a successful lumberjack.
Great shit as always, you never cease to entertain us!
cigs are gross, solid rhymes though
If pokemon taught me anything. Those are jelly donuts.
I'm 12 and I love this silly pink man hehe
That bulge
Pretty sure you can drop all the old shit if you want to man, you'll still have a solid fanbase if you do. I can see that kids sending you "ey b0ss" 100x a day can get fucking soul-destroying. Do what you wanna do, we'll watch whatever you post
No but we do want Joji music.
OOOHHHH dad uploaded
OUR LORD AND SAVIOR PAPA FRANKU AND FRIENDS HAVE BLESSED US WITH A NEW VIDEO FUCK YESSSSSSS
60fps. oh yeah

I think the pink guy is actually part of my subconscious.
Beautiful. I can only dream of something this glorious.
I can see a lot of Tyler in this one.
Awesome song.
That intro reminds me of Proleter's picture on soundcloud
Oh my god so much bass xD
I had to turn off the volume.

Still cleaner than my kitchen
Nice frank
Gomenasai, my name is swift-sama.¬†

I‚Äôm a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)¬†

I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.¬†

I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%¬†

When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!¬†

I own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.¬†

Wish me luck in Japan!
Original video name: Onigiri
Does Frank prefer Reds, Menthol, or Original smooth taste?
I can't smell what the Frank is cooking.
Parts of it sound kinda like odd future
Yoo, this is actually beautiful. I can tell your serious about this, fam. Keep it up, I like what you're doing right now.

This is really dank.

I'd love to treat your dick like a trampoline.
Frank going hard

I wish we still had joji vlogs :( this video made me want to go back and watch them.
reminds me of odd future
Everytime i see a new franku vid i furiously masterbate till my dick bleeds.

You can really tell his hatred for you people is getting out of hand
60 fps i see the video quality getting better joji!! cheers to a new year and for pink guy heat!!!!!
this gives me a big time tyler the creator vibe, not bad man
this has a Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas feel to it.
Good video, but not enough to kill myself.
Thanks for teaching me how to make rice balls b0ss. Clean your kitchen, living room, bathroom, wash them fucking dishes, and don't smoke indoors (that shit peels the ceiling paint).

It's surprising to see an audio issue present like the one clearly audible at 0:22 in this video. It's amateur stuff, and super easy to fix. It's not aesthetically appealing, so I have no idea why it was left unfixed. Don't get me wrong, I love these videos, but that was strange to hear in a song by an experienced producer like Frank.
Frank, love you man. Sincerely
this shit is fucking fire
Fire
your videos used to be good now there just fucked up
Kids in Africa couldve eaten the fire from that mixtape.
Papa franku where have you been. Life isn't the same with put your weekly videos.
Hey Frank, first of all I just wanna say I'm from Brazil and I really enjoy your videos, you're really funny. 

So, although I understand what you say in the regular videos, for some random reason I have some trouble in comprehending your raps. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the music, it's just that I can't put the senteces together, I can understand most words but that's all. 

Anyways, I was just wondering if you could add some English subs on your music videos to make it easier for people who have this same trouble (if there's any). That's it, no weird shit on this comment.

Great video btw.
CINEMATIC 60 FPS
Bro. You act like everyone's gonna flame the shit out of you for every thing you do, especially on twitter. The reality is, most people don't give a fuck. We just think you're funny, and you can put whatever you want on here
yum
They should make a whole channel just for pink guy raps. Or a soundcloud.
I thought it was called ONIGIRI

JOJI I NEED TO SHOW THEM THAT DESPITE ACTING LIKE A RETARD I'M ACTUALLY REALLY SMART LIKE YOU, EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE STUPID FOR YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND I'M STUPID JUST BECAUSE. JOJI I NEED YOU TO VALIDATE MY EXISTENCE.

IT WAS RENAMED TO RICE BALLS!!! IT WAS ONIGIRI FIRST!!
That was fire asf üî•üî•üî•
you are a fucking artistic regard
Frank, for real though, I appreciate this. I too wanted "real" Joji music but your little rant makes sense. If this is what you make, I fully support it, because it sounds fucking bomb. Seriously this has crazy potential. Keep it up boo xoxo
Pink Guy 4 lyfe
If anyone's wondering what this might remind you of, it's Tyler The Creator maybe the songs Jamba and Answer.
Good vocab and flow. I'd pay for more.

Massive production and crazy flows, as always. Please Frank, more music.
He changed the title?
WHY DID YOU RENAME IT YOU FUCK
mmmm, that's a rice meme you got there
what the fuck is this funimation english translation weeaboo shit put it back as onigiri you dub watching faggot
Welcome to the hall.
Why did I think this was a 3-D video..
Frank is legit good, he should have gotten famous from his music, not the worst show on the internet
I generally don't like rap, but I must admit, I love Pink Guy's raps
papa bless
Shave your face you look like if they showed Shaggy from Scooby Doo actually smoking weed.
don't smoke :c
Papa Frank actually got a good flow
Damn, frank dropping some banga beats.
this is what i stayed up for? jeez i finally feel cancer catching on to me.

This is almost as good as Cory in The house
Anthony Fantano
Im just chillin' makin' riceballs everyday.
why did he rename it from onigiri to rice balls lol
nice video senpai unsubscribed
This is the start of him rebelling against his Frank persona, you can tell. Also, I can see the outline of his dick through the pink suit - very distressing. I think he is going through an existential crisis, I estimate that in about 3 to 4 days he's going to kill himself or rape someone.
Nice track, though. Wish you all the best George/Joji (?).
Pink Guy must have a channel called PinkGuyVEVO
holy shit. this niggas production game just increased 10 fold
Wasn't this called onigiri?
Great song to start 2016..... New year, kill me...
this rap was round like an onigiri
batum dass
THIS VIDEO IS VIAGRA TO ME DADDY
This better be on iTunes you fucking faggot

holy crap this beat is infectious and chill at times, another great track from the master himself! :D
daddy
I'm starting to rape the replay button
Wut.
The fans are at civil war with each other and always will be. What we say doesn't matter he is going to do what he feels is right for the channel and it our choice to support him or not. If you wanna talk about his music, his life choices or something else you disagree with him doing then don't watch his videos because his channel is going to be how it was always meant to be...Filthy
PLZ POST INSTUMENTAL SO I CAN MAC A CRAPY RMIX WIH MINE OWN LRYICS PLZ B0$$

At least he raps better than KSI like WAYYYY better.
Hey man, if you could do a video teaching how to do the sushi rice like you did in the video it would be much appreciated, That shit looks so fire to make. And are tuna rice balls a joke food for this video or are they actually good?
Put this on ITunes Nigga
I casually was listening to the tune of this it sounds like he's summoning Satan. 
I started rocking on my rocking chair in a corner while spiting blood out of my mouth. I can feel my inside committing mass suicide.
Instrumental version when tbh?
Straight fire, I liked hearing from good ole Joji at the end
Haha sexy
Wasted a pot of rice...sigh...

You are a rebel, i like you.
The way he constantly talks about how is fanbase is retarded is making these videos seem pretty cynical. I liked the video itself, but he is becoming pretty unlikable imo, and I love his content so that's saying something...
this is art.
White Tyler the creator
Aye boss!
Papa I've missed you.
idk if its just me but that part where it repeats something it sounds like beemo saying finn its prob just me
fILLED wITH tRUTH
Quick, someone post the instrumental of this song so we can laugh at all the bad rap lyric comments
Bleep blap
Reminds me of Tyler the Creator a lot.
Real trvp
Great track. And the beat is real af.
real is relative to peoples view on living. music has a purpose, and it is usually to show the audience a certain emotion. some emotions are bull shit though and should not be around, where as others are not. :v)
This song sounds like some shit off Odd future
Pink guy grew up so fast :')

He can rap, he can sing, he can make sick beats, he's good at video editing, he can speak perfect Japanese, he plays multiple characters & he can make me laugh my ass off. This man deserves to be makin the big bucks.
Sounds like he influenced by Chance The Rapper and Odd Future.
Pink guy has grown a beard.

You know what that means

Fist me daddy
My phone caught on fire
This guy really knows how to write good ass music

Tell pink guy to shave that beard already
I'm glad he finally addressed all the people asking for old Joji back, just let him do what he wanna do, b0ss.

Hey..... That's¬†pretty good!
Solid video Franku senpai, hard bars as always. By the way, didn't you say that Pink Guy was NOT PinkOmega?

So, I'm retarded. What is this video supposed to mean?
edgy af
Bruh.

Must really fuckin' blow having people trivialize your sound and situation as a musician to suit their own warped fantasies of you.
thoroughly enjoyed this one, what do you use to make your beats i wonder?
Fruity loops?
Omg omg omg. It's Pink Guy. I am in love

My favorite frank was the rapping Joji.
Perfect timing. I just finished my noose .
1 like = 1 cigarette saved
How come a bunch of youtubers are trying to be friends with him now? I didn't see this many dick riding faggots when Frank was at 300,000 subs
Keeps gettin better and better BO$$ can't wait to see what you've got for us in 2016! love you so much!

Thanks for making the videos you make Frank, u smart, u da best, i appreciate you.

Let just all agree George can spit fuckin fire
This is art!

Yeah man I'm starting to get annoyed at the Joji music comments too. An artist can produce whatever he or she wants; its his music, not his audiences. He or she is not obliged to make music that pleases their audiences.

Only thing I missed about the old times were the vlogs. They were entertaining and funny. Breaking the 4th wall like that on a channel as 'special' as this one is pretty interesting.
Pink guy album 2??
omg this is perfect... I love this
Stop watching One Piece you fag
My house burned down...
DAM DOOD
Yes Frank, we get it now
You smoke
You are cool now
So far I've spotted 3 youtubers comments. What is this conspiracy
what are you fucking gay?
pink guy's drops are major üîë to success
Filthy

sounds like somethin from odd future
Lets get fucking wild in 2016
George stop smoking.

that shit was fire, bro
at first I thought you meant onigiri the game
um .. i'm sorry kind sir , but is that thing at 1:00 necessary for it to be done good ?
Hey Frank, you're an autistic retard.

Happy new year, faggot.

Kinda like it tbh.
I wanna see a qna from you. and your voice sounds good when you tap.
He let's the beat drop like old people with polio
Lovin this 60 fps
That beat change...
papa franku in glorious 60fps
You are dropping rhymes like Malaysian Airlines
Happy New year Franku!!!
Oh I'm Pink Guy I smoke to look cool. I'm like the new-new James Dean.

Careful Papa Franku. Pink Guy gonna give you le quand c'est b0ss.
last time something dropped that hard ww2 ended
My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him,'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately.Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said tome- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 18, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this video gave me cancer anyway.
you can tell he's putting more effort into his videos and at the same time its loosing the fucking random autistic cancer that there used to be, I'm starting to appreciate these videos more
2:37 to the end was the realist shit I've ever his joji/frank/pinkguy/pinkomega/whatever the fuck you want to call him spit. People saying 'We want you to make actual music!!!' How do you think he feels when he puts time and effort into making these and jojifags shit on it for not being 'real'? Keep doing what you're doing man, mad respect.
PINK GUY 2 album?
When the mixtape dropping B0$s. This is Edgy as Fuck üî•
You're actually so fucking savage, george.

I love how you just come out with that "Fuck all you 12 year olds that think they know me, ill do what I enjoy watch it or don't I don't give a fuck." I love it.

Also, I would love to see some music colabs with gay retard and maxmoefoe, that would be fucking halarious.

When I get done with you, you bet your ass you're celebate (eww)
Fuck your dog I can smack E.T.
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe (what is that too rude?)

You actually smoke man? Doesn't really matter to me, just curious
fire
this flow is so fucking good man
I never thought that watching pink guy in 60 fps would be so amusing.
Need to collab with PolitikZ with the Z
I really want George to make a real YouTube account, where he does skits and blogs with his real self, (go ahead and call me a "Joji fag", loser) I love FilthyFrank, but it's just weird that it seems as if Filthy Frank, Pink Guy, Salamander Man, Chin Chin is who he really is, how he acts at home and with his friends when they're not shooting videos. It's odd, but this song was great, amazing song, b0ss
Lyrics?
Would be cool if we had your music on spotify or some shit like that.
it's lit
pink omega damn dude you got pink o-meta
FUCK but that was good, both the song and the video. Keep it up, proud of you.

huh... my balls caught fire while watching this... is that supposed to happen?
I think joji is getting sick of having to act retarded to have people actually watch him. a while back he actually made a video explaining that he's a person and needs to be known. people said they didn't care. they wanted filthy frank. he took down the video and continued to be "filthy frank" to make the people happy.
so rad. excited for more of your shit nigger faggot :)
Franku stop smoking u less u want cancer
This is the first frank video I've watched in 5 months. I can say I'm glad I didn't watch him for so long. His fanbase is literally shit. Even worse than the last time I watched. Sorry frank but this is cancer.
pussy b0ss
I'm feeling a strong 8 light 9
No filthyfrank motherfucker outro? What is this?
thank you based god

Pinkguy has such a beautiful voice.
I agreed with your rant at the end. putting labels on "real" music vs I guess "goofy" music(?) is retarded. music is music, you do what you do best you're still gonna have fans that enjoy it.
pinkguy is top tier husband material

I MISS JOJI MUSIC ISN'T REAL MUSIC WTF JOJI VLOGS PLS JOJI REEL MUSIK PLEASEWA JOJI VLOB
1:12 The "moment of clarity", breaking the flow of the tune, is the most human I could see George being in Pink Guy's character. 
Degeneracy can be amusing as an act, but hurts people when they exist naturally with an inflated ego, addictions and senseless ramblings. 
Who the fuck asks George for real music? All of his music is real.
MAN FUCK DRAKE, HIS SHIT IS CORRUPT!
this is real music when you clutch that ooze, baby.
who's first?
fuckin dope.
can i get your recipe
Congratulations on 1,5 million you fat asian fuck.
Inb4 322
If frank doesn't put his music on spotify I will piss blood
moms spaghetti
I have nothing to add to this comment section
Heyyy, that's pretty good.
I don't need a microwave... Cause I'm already heated üî•üî•üî•üî•
l i t e r i n o
It's weird hearing his actual voice, like his filthy voice is all i hear when i see his ugly mug, its off putting to hear something that actually sounds human coming out frank's mouth. Love you, you filthy bastard!
Can't die of lung cancer cuz of succumbing to Internet cancer first

are the cigarette ashes required to make rice balls, or is that just a personal preference?
The only thing that has changed is that you started smoking..... fucking piece of shit cancer fuck. jk luv u papa
TJC Destruction, I cause a huge disruption
You try to butt in but you're not in the discussion
Rushin to get my name out till they're screaming and I'm crushin
Till I got a whole family of followers to back me and the money means nothin

If you ever met me I was a nice guy and a shy voice 
You got to know this sound is passion and never just noise
So many forget their blessings throw them away treat them like a toy
I will focus on making music like I'm making a man out my boy
PAPA FRANKU
BRBR HUEHUE
Damn bro, this was really edgy. And not in a semi-ironic way, either. Cool song, though.
Damn son B)
Hey, that's pretty good!
I feel like Joji got high/drunk and threw his body into the shower that's why the wall behind him is fucked up
Thanks filthy.
Blaze weed m9
Where can I buy this, tho?
I think it's clear this is directed to the faggots on all the Joji beats videos writing fucking speeches about how they support Joji and want him to make his own decisions, when I think it's been make clear, this is what Joji wants to do.
I'm the 8.888th like...
...Cool.
I really needed another jam, thanks G
what joji music ?

Frank you smart. Matter o fact you a genius. Don't eva play yo self.

Dank
there is no such thing as serious music.....
PRAISE CHIN CHIN
Noiiiice
Even though this song is making fun of people who like pink guy songs i still like it
but i thought that beat was reserved for the joji album
Can I cosplay  Pink Guy? I'd like to buy your cosplay.
I am surprised he even would reference the people crying over wanting the old jojimusic stuff back or people were still bitching over that
H
Where can we download these, man?

This camera has better quality than my eyes.

This is really well produced.
Man I'm sharing this with everybody I know. This is good classic fun and its the rap is fire. First time I can be publicly proud of you Papa. You deadass inspired me today to start making some music just to enjoy myself. Your fucking beats remind me of nujabes. Fucking hell man I cant believe I respect a such a faggot. The end was fucking beautiful. god damn.....
Suprised your flat didn t burn .... cuz that shit is on FIRE
please b0ss, never take out the "it's filthy frank muthafucka"
And to think they said I couldn't learn to cook with this channel. They said its too dangerous. FUCK THE SYSTEM!!!
Actually extremely well done
this lit my cup of water om fire
Man your house sucks.
papa franku at his finest ladies and gentlemen.
ey b0ss?
Have you seen chef?

Big ups homie
This made me sad.
gay and fake
Dude fuck
Nice popoo my brother.
Nigga I had to spice up yo face ugly ass bitch muthafucka
I saw this in class today and while I was listening to it I clamped on to my desk as hard as I could and screamed 
OH FUCK YES.
i have a feeling frank will slowly start to make more videos either featuring or involving his actual self. you can tell he really cares about his audience and is determined to create things for us. but he also doesn't care for people that aren't supportive of new ideas that he has. he does what makes him and the true fans happy. so i really believe him when he says it will be an awesome 2016. thanks b0ss
Omg this is beautiful
nice real music, pink omega
His final commentary kind of reaches my heart, makes me sad
I came
Pink guy dropping the fiya
this is what happens if ChinChin didn't make any sacrifices 

but for real George you are doing some amazing shit keep on the good work and do whatever the fuck you want
this shit goes harder than a klonopin buffet nigga
You clearly weren't bombed enough
wait... he wasn't trying to stay in character. Could it be... JOJI IS BACK!!!
Now everybody, let's all take a moment to thank our lord and savior, Chin Chin, for presenting us with such a master of music.
Let's all go to the lobby to get ourselves a treat.
Joji (think that's what they call you.) , I don't care about the characters you act out in these videos ya they are funny to the viewer, seeing someone be stupid and upload it shit I'll watch it. Just hope you having in mind if you don't like doing this shit I support you. Take care! oh and college is a pain in the ass hope you're cramming in time to study.
Does your parents watch your videos? If so what on earth do they think of you?
Pink Guy has a beard now....
lmao he just dissed the people asking for the joji miller side of the FF community at the end
It's lit üî•üî•üî•
That Joji bit was SAVAGE bruh
why does filthy frank try so hard to be chinese when hes white, it reminds me of every weeaboo out there, gg
Oh boy, the 12 year old's are gonna love this.
Did you just say "mem"? (Meme) Nice balls.
he can cook he can dance he can rap like god theres something more that he need, i dont think so.
is pink guy getting handsome or do i have problems ?
RICE GIVES YOU CANCER FRANK!! STOP!!
fake
I legitimately think that George just came out and said that this whole time people have been asking for real music when that's what he's been doing.
Let's show this to Jessica Nigri and call her onigri hehehe

Don't even have to watch video to like it ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Have you got a budget yet? this is some high quality shit right here - no really, this is absolutely awful (top notch, genuine electrifying, Earth-shattering, fantastic) viewing. Well done, you've earned a gold star to put on the special chart. 

For srs though this is great. If that dying, flickering glimmer of a human soul still exists  in the cold, piercing dark eyes of Pink Guy then good job on the video. If not then well, thanks for the cancer bro.
Han Solo dies
