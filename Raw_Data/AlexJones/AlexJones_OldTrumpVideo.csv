Why do you think all the muslims around the world being massacred and brutally attacked, example, Syria, Palestine, Libya and many more places. I think Trump is deeply agains Zionist controlled policies, that is why I am supporting him. If Hillary elected, her cabinet most likely will be 90% consist of Zionists.  Zionism is the evil cause of all the problems around the world and Zionism and its media behind Muslim bashing and hate in this country. Once again, I am sorry, I insulted you initially.  May Allah bless you. I believe, Allah will give a sign to Trump that Islam is not what he thinks and sooner or later will understand the facts. I rather have somebody who can stand against Zionist controlled media and congress than somebody totally obey their orders.",0

Prove that I have either of those things and I will concede. Tell me what testable barriers you face as a non-white person that prevent you from succeeding.

In my experience, all races get equal treatment in the workplace, in the justice system, etc. White privilege is a myth designed to explain why minorities have a higher unemployment rate and a higher rate of crime. If white privilege exists, why aren't Asians oppressed? Asians outperform every other race in level of education and average lifetime earnings. Can people not be racist towards Asians? Is there Asian privilege?",0

And that's because of institutional racism and not because black communities are much poorer?

""young black men are 4 times more likely to get arrested for possession of marijuana"" It's almost as if black neighborhoods have a much higher rate of crime and are therefore patrolled more by police who, therefore will make more stops of cars than in a low-crime area.

""3 Young black men (under 18 in this case) are overwhelmingly more likely to be treated and given adult punishments under the court of law than their white counterparts."" Can you link the data for this?

""why Obama has received more threats than the last 4 presidents combined?"" 1. How could you possibly know how many threats and president receives? Give me proof. 2. Could threats at all be due to him undermining checks and balances and ignoring Congress through executive orders?",0

That's the problem.

The very reason I don't like Trump is that he speaks ""The Big Stupid"" too well.  People are going to vote with him to screw the establishment and what they don't realize yet, what they may never fully realize is much like the EU leave vote, is that the part of the establishment they need the most is going to screw them.

Illegals get valid SSNs, they also use friends, and banks don't have databases tied to anything that can tell them anything other than the uniqueness of the SSN.

It also might be a reflection of a peoples' inability to reason thus being easily rallied by gas-filled slogans that mean nothing such as ""Make America Great Again.""   How many people do you think Bill Gates has offended over his career?  How about Steve Jobs?  How about an entertainment personality like Howard Stern or Joan Rivers?   There are more than a few very successful business men and women I've encountered over the years who I know to be severely bigoted if not outright racist.  They're all doing just fine. 

Personally, I could care less if Trump himself is a racist  because that's not the issue at all.  What concerns me is that many of the people who follow Trump are openly bigoted or racist, but racist or not, they're seemingly always xenophobic.  Whether Trump is merely playing into that audience of ignorance or if he is himself one of those people does not change the real problem he uncovered. That's the larger issue.

As far as the other argument which is Catholics in the media, sorry, I couldn't be more uninterested in that argument. It's a trite self-victimizing statement played out as long as humans have been religious -- which is to say, most of our entire existence.  If it's not Catholics, it's Jews, if it's not Jews, it's White Anglo Saxon Protestants, if it's not that it's Muslims or Mormon's or Scientologists.  It's always the media's fault, or corporations, or NGO's or government or other people who don't look like I do or you do.  When, oh when will it ever be the truth?  If you want to know what is right or wrong about anything, the first place, the only place you need to look is within.",0

In the clip he shares broad topic problems with no focal points and doesn't offer any clear solutions other than 'he would intend to fix them.'

Quoting from the Opera clip:  

Trump:  ""I'm tired of seeing the country ripped off...""  

My question:  How is it being ripped off, where, in which areas, can you elaborate on that statement Mr. Trump?  

Trump: ""But I do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country and if it got so bad, I would never want to rule it (being president) out totally because I really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country, how we're-how we're really making other people live like kings and we're not.""  

My questions:  Again, Mr. Trump, what's happening in this country that you don't like?  Which 'other people' are you speaking of when you say they're 'living like kings?'  When you state this, which standards of living in the US are you comparing against those who 'live like kings' in your view?  You are clearly a wealthy man with power and influence who could be supporting these causes right now, would you provide some real world examples on how you've strived to combat this in your own business today?

So to follow your statement I hear (as I've heard) Trump make broad statements on our economy, the state of our country's welfare and our security, but I've heard very little substantiated claims.  

I'd be happy to hear where you've heard differently in this clip.  Thank you.",0

Little brains!!??  Rump is clearly one of the dumbest, uneducated people ever to be the official candidate from either party, apart from maybe George Bush Jr.  He  has virtually no knowledge of world events, world leaders, places and is ignorant on most history, even quite recent history. When asked an awkward question , maybe about a subject he is unaware of, instead of  'fessing up and admitting he isn't knowledgeable ( which of course,  happens to the best of us), Rump just makes blunder after blunder. He either guesses, often wrongly, or just intensifies that blank look on his face and talks about something unconnected with the question. Can you just imagine this grade A buffoon trying to relate to world leaders, foreign ministers/secretaries and even ambassadors in the US?   It is  a totally  unthinkable scenario.. 
Yes, this is clearly, party  explained   by Rump's  abusive childhood, at the hands of his KKK member, take no prisoners,domineering  father, Frederick Rump Sr.  (Incidentally, an abusive chid-hood which led his older brother, Freddy Rump JR, to become a serious teenage alcoholic and eventually die from it at the age of 43).  However, Donald must take  the lions share  of responsibility for his action and words himself. He is in his 60's now for f@*%ks sake!
It is clearly one helluva' Hobson's choice- Lying, narcissistic, bullying Rump or  flip-flopping, disingenuous, bandwagon- jumping  H Clinton.

Besides that, what other people are they making into kings, Israelis?  He seems to be obsessed with the notion of competition and cannot see that artificial competition itself is the problem.  We have enough natural competition to deal with, what we need is to create a synergetic environment, where people feed off of each other instead of on each other.

It shows that his opinions haven't necessarily changed over time about being screwed by globalists and how he would only run if he thought he could win and if he felt America had come to such a bad point where it was necessary and how he didn't want to have to run. ""That he's been standing true to the same things for years."" This IN NO WAY advocates why he deserves and is right to be the leader of a country, in charge of our laws and lives really, repersenting our country and US.

       he's never even been mayor, and I think that that is NECESSARY before trying to be a president. Would you trust some real estate billionaire on your block to be president? No, you wouldn't, because he has absolutely no credentials- so wth are you trusting in Donald Trump? 
       Let alone the fact that he is immature and impulsive and rude etc. I think he was a better person then. He's NOT ""the same guy"". He seemed actually seemed kinda humble, and caring etc and now he's racist, stupid- doesn't research things before talking publicly about it such as when he said the judge wasn't American and when he said the Orlando shooter was an immigrant. Also he's so insulting to other politicians (and people) and that's not professional, respectful, or promising. idc if professionals say ""he does it coz it's a great tactic"" to get us citizens thinking the same way, and thus lean to HIM instead. That's going go get terrorists to hate America even more. He will have absolutely NO professionality with foreign countries/meeting either.

Sometimes it is right to use force , but force isn't always the answer. It depends on the situation. But there's no way in hell I want Hillary in charge of the US. She's a liar and a snake. Let alone the fact she could still go to jail. I'm just praying that America won't get destroyed and we will make it through 4 years just like every other time",0,false,0,,,,,,

Somehow people think that since Trump has a lot of money he will be a benefit to America because he'll show others how to become wealthy (Being wealthy is of major importance to a lot of people).  That worked out so well for all those that attended Trump University!
Trump is a Fascist.  Naysayers are just too stupid to realize any better.  Trump has the majority of the stupid in America at the moment and the really sad part is they are a huge part of the United States.  
Trump will repress freedoms.  Trump wants a ban on all Muslims and has limited certain press among other things.  
Trump is a lot like Kim Jong-un and Putin with the major difference coming in his locale.  Trump will be repressive and will be as much of a tyrant as he can get away with.  
Most Germans loved Hitler and didn't really realize how bad he was until it was too late.  You figure people would learn from the mistakes of the past, but the simple reality is people don't know or even worse don't care.  There are even some that want Trump because they want World War III.  Not sure how they think it would benefit  America.  Even if America emerged victorious it would be very hard to imagine the US being better off than before.  If such a thing as the Antichrist exists, it surely must be Trump.

is not just some corrupt government.. or some legislation.

And when unjust social structures/systems prevent people from achieving good health and from achieving good lives - This is structural violence in action. 

The global monetary system is a failure, as any shitty economy that produces rich and poor. 
The redesign of our socioeconomic structure will be inevitable
The current system creates artificial SCARCITY > Breeds competition, immorality, conflict, problem creation for the sake of profit, and much suffering. 

Education starts when we stop taking this old shitty unsustainable system for granted...

Capitalism‚Äôs grow-or-die imperative stands radically at odds with ecology‚Äôs imperative of interdependence and limit? The two imperatives can no longer coexist with each other; nor can any society founded on the myth that they can be reconciled hope to survive.
Either we will establish an ecological society or society will go under for everyone, irrespective of his or her status.

We have essentially chosen cancer as the model of our social system.
All we have, we have taken from the earth, and taking with ever-increasing speed and greed, we now return little but what is sterile or poisoned. Yet we can‚Äôt stop the process. A capitalist economy, by definition, lives by growth.

Why not share in my wisdom?  Come on...it feels good ,I promise. 
To quote precisely from my last post - ""Let me get this straight. You are a supporter of Donald Rump right?'  So I am actually checking first if you are a supporter of the Rump . Comprendez? OK, so maybe I missed you previously stating that you do not support Rump. Surely that doesn't make me a 'dumbass' or a 'damned troll' ? . That was your opportunity to maturely point out what I had failed to pick up on, and make it clear that you do not. 
 As for Serge Kovaleski- You are incorrect. Serge is a New York Times reporter.  He is employed as an investigative reporter on the Culture Desk at The New York Times.( Go on- check out that fact .  I dare you)  He and Donald Rump had previously had quite a good relationship, The 2 of them had met several times when Kovaleski had interviewed him. It was only when Kovaleski wrote something critical of Rump  that the Donald then publicly mocked his disability. Have you watched the clip I gave a link to?? Do you think that kind of behaviour is acceptable??

Lastly, I notice that you have now used the word 'disability' . I congratulate you for that.

l'iberal/Ààl…™b(…ô)r(…ô)l/
adjective
willing to respect or accept behaviour or opinions different from one's own; open to new ideas.
(of education) concerned with broadening a person's general knowledge and experience, rather than with technical or professional training.
(especially of an interpretation of a law) broadly construed or understood; not strictly literal.
given, used, or occurring in generous amounts'. 

I am at a loss to understand why you bring up the term 'harassment'' . At no stage have I claimed that you are harassing me : As an experienced children's Social Worker, who once  worked in a teenagers residential home for 3 years, I assure you I am not easily intimidated . I do not resort to crying 'Bully' or 'Harassment'  lightly, unlike some more sensitive souls these days. 
 As L Klaassy kindly points out, you have failed to bring up any facts, of your own or to demonstrate that you have researched any of my references or facts.  And yet you claim that I have shown no 'real intelligence'. or show any 'real intellect' .......

Perhaps one further reference will help here- 
Intelligence -''The ability to acquire knowledge and skills'.( Oxforddictionaries, com)

-Intelligence has been defined in many different ways including one's capacity for logic, abstract thought, understanding, self-awareness, communication, learning, emotional knowledge, memory, planning, creativity and problem solving. (  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence)

2. So, the precise quote you are referring to is -' A government big enough to give you everything you want, is a government big enough to take away everything that you have."". I assume you are making the common mistake of attributing this to Thomas Jefferson. This quote, nor anything like it, has never been found in the writings of Jefferson.  
It was first used in print in 1953, then was frequently used in newspapers 1950s, often in political cartoons.. It was copyrighted in 1957 by the General Features Corporation, as part of a syndicated newspaper feature called ""Today's Chuckle.""  It later became a popular saying among Republican politicians eg- Governor Harold W. Handley of Indiana used it in his annual message to the Indiana General Assembly in 1961;

Unfortunately it depends on how you define ""majority of the votes"".  Does everyone get voted in with the majority?  Yes.  Does everyone get voted it based on what the general public decides?  No.  (I don't know where your from, but) in the US they use the electoral college (which doesn't have to reflect the popular vote).

Even if that was abolished, statistics and psychology would influence people to vote with propaganda instead of their true wants.  The only  way to get away from that is to move to a different type of voting system (and not keep the one-vote winner-take-all system they have now).",1

You're presenting 2 qualities as powerful reasons to elect him, that sound like making a strong case for the opposite to me.

1. When I consider hiring someone, the single most important factor is how much the person really wants to do the job that needs done. Being president of the USofA seems to be about the most grueling and in many ways unrewarding job possible - so how exactly is not wanting to do that job a powerful reason to elect Drumpf?

2. My second key criteria for hiring is a track record of follow-through, of doing what one says. So how is it a powerful reason to elect Drumpf, that he's been talking about something for almost 40 years, yet - if I'm not all mistaken - consistently doing the opposite, or at least not what he's talking about doing? (regarding the powers that be).

Please help me understand?

And if you combine this with his obsession for winning, how could he satisfy that need as a president? Realistically, I could only imagine this by him waging even more war, and like he suggested, taking out the families of ""the enemy"", because that's what it takes and winners do what it takes (sarcasm).

Don't get me wrong, I'd throw up if Hillary gets elected, but this guy?!",0,false,0,,,,,,

z133u3sxapbtgdtvx22achtz4z21ylefh,Angry Writer,10 months ago,1467933482613,"Donald Trump inherited his money.  He didn't work for it like he's trying to convince every US citizen. And from the stats, he's barely increased his net worth since he took over his Dad's business in 1971.  He is not a self made man as he proclaims to be.  Also in the few snippets this video shows, he keeps complaining that America is getting ripped off, but he doesn't specify by whom.  Who has been ripping off America?  I know who - people like him.  I don't think any candidate running for President in 2016 is up to the job.  The only difference with Trump is that he uses different rhetoric to Hilary.  This repetition ""I tell it like it is"" is nonsense.  What has he told you?  That Mexicans are all criminals (they're not), that he respects women (Esquire interview quoted him in 1991 as saying ""You know, it doesn‚Äôt really matter what [the media] write as long as you‚Äôve got a young and beautiful piece of ass""), that he's not a corrupt politician (Trump worked with companies controlled by the Mafia on properties in New York & Atlantic City including Trump Tower and Trump Plaza. He claims he didn't know the companies were Mafia controlled which either makes him a) a liar or b) incompetent - 2 traits you want in a President naturally)   He hasn't told anyone about how it really is.  He tells people what they think want to hear...just like any other crude and corrupt  politician looking for votes. I don't think Hilary is the best choice in this election, but she is the better choice - the best of a bad bunch (which says more about the terrible state of global politics than anything else could).  Don't be under any illusion America: Trump is only in it for himself.  He doesn't care about you or your family.  He cares about one person: Donald J Trump.  He's right about one thing; no one is better than building walls than Donald Trump...Walls that are barriers to cooperation, mutual understanding and social development.  By all means vote for this man.  Just don't be surprised if your country is in a worse state in 4 years.  I think you can do better than Trump (and probably Hilary) and in 4 years time I hope you have someone who fits the ideology of an equal and progressive America, and is willing to take every risk in the book to achieve that.  I understand a lot of your anger with the liberal administration', but don't let that anger and fear force you into making a decision you will later regret.  For now all I can say is that videos like this just serve to propagate the same tired negative campaigning politics rife around the world.  As an observer of global politics; It's depressing.

Of course it isn't 99%. However, that doesn't mean immigrants(and muslims in particular) are not overly present in rape statistics. The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention said 53% of rapes were commited by immigrants in the 80's, back when there were way less immigrants then there are nowadays but they haven't released any new data since then. Since there are more and more immgirants in Sweden, it's safe to say that percentage have gone up and some sources say that 80% of rapes are now commited by non-natives and that a muslim immigrant is 23 times more likely to commit a rape than a native Swede.

I posed a quote about diversity, some comments above. 

By Frank Ellis, professor from Britain, 

''No successful society shows a spontaneous tendency towards multiculturalism or multiracialism. Successful and enduring societies show a high degree of homogeneity. Those who support multiculturalism either do not know this or, what is more likely, realize that if they are to transform Western societies into strictly regulated, racial-feminist bureaucracies they must first undermine those societies.''

''Today, of course, we are made to believe that diversity is strength, perversity is virtue, success is oppression, and that relentlessly repeating these ideas over and over is ""tolerance and diversity."" Indeed, the multicultural revolution works subversion everywhere, just as Communist revolutions did: judicial activism undermines the rule of law; ""tolerance"" weakens the conditions that make real tolerance possible; universities, which should be havens of free inquiry, practice censorship that rivals that of the Soviets. At the same time, we find a relentless drive for equality:

the Bible, Shakespeare, and rap ""music"" are just texts with ""equally valid perspectives;"" deviant and criminal behavior is an ""alternative life-style.""",0

Would love to see the source of this claim, especially sense the 'quote' has errors that would be heavily scrutinized if found in an official study.

""Although black men are more than six times more likely to be sent to prison than white men, white men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes.""

1) Trump CAN NOT get the US economy back on track. His history with money proves that. If he cant even manage his own billions of dollar (filed bankruptcy 4 times), just think what will happen to your own money.  He rags on people who use welfare yet at the same time, when asked about filing for bankruptcy, he blantantly and proudly proclaims that he was just taking advantage of the system like everyone else.
2) He is promising to build a wall to stop Mexicans from coming to the US and he claims that he will make Mexico pay for it. How would he do that? With YOUR tax money. He can ask Mexico but it doesnt mean they will do it.
3) He claims he will stop Muslims from coming to the US. Really? How? How can anyone tell who anyone is? He says by close monitoring and screening. With YOUR money.
4) This guy has no fucking clue when it comes to foreign policy and nuclear weapons. You want this erratic asshole access to nukes?
5) Sure, he says what he wants without a filter. But let's see what happens when he speaks that way to the wrong guy who has access to nukes. World War 3 anyone? 
6) When asked about the relationship with our allies and supporting other countries financially, he said America comes first yet in the same breath, he promised continued staunch support of Israel (which gets 3 billion dollars of American money a year.
7) He is a hypocrite and a liar. Asshole does business dealings with wealthy Muslims and Arabs all over the world. Bipolar?
8) This guy's hateful rhetoric and confrontational style will only lead to more terrorist attacks. 9/11 the sequel.

Donald Trump does not relate to the average man. He did not work for his wealth, it was inherited, therefore he will never understand the working man's struggle.

Come on man, you can't invoke the Hitler argument and actually expect to be taken seriously. That's the weakest play in the book. If you'd actually pay attention to what he wants to do, I don't think you'd feel that way. His intent is to protect the law-abiding and stable citizens of America, which includes moderate Muslims, from the¬† extremists that will pour into our country almost entirely un-vetted under someone like Hillary, like it has with Obama, and inevitably tragedies like the one in Orlando will become more and more commonplace, and with those attacks you'll see our rights diminish more and more and have it be covered up with the promise of ""safety"" if we give our federal government that power.

You make a solid argument as well, and the internment camps were terrible, I agree on that one entirely. And unfortunately, you can't really, that's why a very thorough vetting process is so necessary, to see where these people come from originally, where they travel to regularly like the San Bernardino killers who traveled back and forth and were radicalized in the process. If the letting in of refugees and asylum seekers is slowed down because of this, then so be it. The safety and well being of the American people comes first, and that is how it should be. We need to stop worrying about being politically correct, and we need to focus on who the real enemies are here, but the government is making the law-abiding citizens out to be the bad guys, and refuses to acknowledge the problems that Islam is bringing to the western world. And can we talk to Isis? I think that really depends. I know first and foremost, we can stop supplying them with the ammo and resources to start off with, and go on from there.",2

Its embarrassing that Republicans, already as much of a joke that they are, are prepared to endorse this buffoon. I went to multiple Trump rallies to meet the people who supported him, and I mean this as wholehearted as I possibly can be; I was shocked and astounded that people could be so unintelligent, uneducated, and ignorant to FACTUAL information. For example: they would persist that 9/11 was the reason we were in the Middle East and would tell me that it was all ""liberal propaganda"" when I would tell them we've been present in the Middle East since World War II. Its comes to me with no surprise that people are willing to support him. He's the stereotypical, loudmouth ""patriot"" who is willing to go against political correctness (i.e. be ignorant, racist, bigot, insight hate and violence). I grew up in Europe, in the US military so I saw all of these 20 year old kids who only join the armed forces to kill people and blow stuff up. I was appalled by this ""American Patriotism"" because I would receive hate for saying I'm pro-sensible gun laws or pro-choice or that I support the US enacting legislation that worked great in the EU or EU countries. America needs to shape up, and big time. Its time to get out of this popular kid in high school ego and realize that if we want to move forward anywhere in the world, we need to elect sensible leaders both for National Government and local governments, start to work mutually with other countries to make the world as powerful and unified as possible. One way to start that, its to dump Trump. It is impossible for the United States to move forward when the rest of the world is prepared to give up on us if we elect this man. When you sit and think about great American presidents and the powerful people who shaped this country or paved the way for others to do great things, do you really think Donald Trump will ever hold a place on that list?",1,false,0,,,,,,

She is a sick woman.

Luis, do you always display your ignorance for the world to see?
Trump is calling for an America First, non globalist, anti-war, agenda (except for dealing with ISIS quickly which btw ISIS is the result of 0bama and HRC policies). 
The globalists like Hillary hate Putin because Putin stands against the NWO agenda. Why are 0bama and the Left and the NWO Neocons picking a fight with Russia? Because Russia is standing up against their agenda which is global governance. 
And the result of the NWO (Hillary's NWO) will be that you will be their serf/slave to serve the elite. They're almost there, just vote for Hillary for complete world dictatorship.
Why do you think they hate Trump. Because he is exposing their evil deeds. They prey on ignorant people who have been brainwashed and duped.
BTW it is NOT ""Their the same"". It should be they're the same. 
I hope that lesson helped.

¬†¬† Are you serious? He's consistently lied about A LOT of things. This week we even got former employees from Trump University saying it was made as a scam to deliberatly fool people.
¬†¬† When he showcased all of his products during that debate where he tried to imply that his failed business investments were still up, some of them were litterally other brands with his logo slapped on top.
¬†¬†¬† He said he woudn't go to the debate with Megan Kelly because he was raising money for veterans, which he did, around 6 million dollars, but he kept the money and only had to donate it after international media pressed him repetedly about it.
¬† Hillary is no angel, and this election is definetely a tough decision, but Trump is a compulsive lier compared to her. Here's a list I found with a quick Google search. It's 101 confirmed lies from him.

So their complaints against TU had no backbone. This case should've been dismissed. The Judge, was appointed by Obama to preside over the case. a judge who is also a RACIST. And the trump U case, is a civil litigation, has nothing to do with POLITICS. Killary's scandals, LIES, CORRUPTION has everything to do with POLITICS. Debate with Meghan Kelly? I didn't know she was someone to debate. Do you mean Bernie Sanders? And there was no reason to debate Sanders was there? Why? Sanders was beat by Killary? And the 6 million raised for the vets, no, they DID get that money. He didn't keep it for himself. The Veteran organizations had to be researched to make sure they were LEGITIMATE before the money could be sent. Would you send money to someone if you didn't know if they were real or not?

Also, from the videos of him that I've seen he sucks up to every feminist and liberal propaganda there is.

1 - True Anarchy is about limitations placed on government. It is not without government. The typical thoughts on anarchy was developed by Hollywood. The Declaration of Independence was written and signed by anarchists. They threw off the shackles of the Crown because of they way they were being treated by the Crown & the British Parliament.
2 - The US is not a Democratic Republic. It is a Representative Republic. Modern education has been misguided children about the truths in order to extinguish the facts. I graduated in 1983 and much of what I was taught was a lie. 
 There is a big difference between Democracy & Republic. They are different forms of government. The biggest difference is that in a Democratic society it is the rule of the collective. In a Republic it is the right of the individual.

Step 4:  Victory against the shadowy organizations!

Here's a hint to all you people I've probably enraged with this post:  If the website has conspiracy buzzwords in the title or URL, it's probably full of unfounded lies and wild speculations (like infowars) and only survives because the people who frequent it refuse to think for themselves or do independent research to verify what they are being told.  This is the same site that helped to spread misinformation regarding vaccines, assisting in the deaths of thousands of children...children who would still be alive today if their parents had done their own research instead of believing a snake-oil salesman selling them convenient lies and convincing them to fight the ""man"" or whatever.

The word of the day is: Demagogue - extra points for looking this up in the dictionary (hint: this is your first step to freedom).

Do yourself a favor and take 5 minutes to do a google search on infowars and scam, or infowars and lies (hint ignore any results that come back from infowars itself).

Know what you're talking about before you open your mouth and try to have a discussion or argument with another person - and don't spread misinformation like the virus that it is.",144,true,49,,,,,,

And you know that those numbers weren't fabricated by a news outlet, those were the results and they were reported by pretty much everyone - including Faux News.

Here are some facts (since you want to talk about Drumpf so badly):
His favorability among women (just over 50% of the US population - less than 30% of which support Trump) and minorities (ironic phrasing if you ask me as they make up almost 40% of the US population - less than 20% support him and I've seen numbers as low as 4%) is basically non-existent, his own party pretty much hates him, independents are put off by his xenophobic bullying and racist remarks, and the only groups that really support him are white supremacist groups and people who never graduated high school.  And that fact is made even sadder when you consider that he polls terribly even among white males(more than 50% have negative views of him).  Since I suspect math and science (obviously) aren't your strong point, let me just sum that up by pointing out that gives him about 30-36% overall approval rating across the board for the whole country.

But he is definitely going to win and make America great again (because you apparently suck at math or can close your eyes, plug your ears, and block out the world).

Just what FACTS have you checked out? how about the FACT that Donald Rump employed a number of Mafia run construction and contractors to build and re-furbish his buildings , from the late 1970s, through to at least the 1990s. Incidentally, he also employed one run by a confirmed Triad head- gangster  , a man named Tony Leung. 
 In the early 80s, Rump engaged a construction company, S & A Concrete, owned by Anthony 'Fat Tony' Salerno and Paul Castellano, to work on his buildings. Both were heads respectively, or actually figureheads, of the notorious Genovese and Gambino Mafia crime families. 'Fat Tony' Salerno was later  convicted on 2 serious counts of racketeering, imprisoned for 101 years and later died in jail in 1992, His indictment included racketeering connected with his $8 million contract to work on Trump Plaza. Rump actually met 'Fat Tony' Salerno at the offices of Rumps notorious 'fixer' lawyer, Roy Cohn, with witnesses to prove it. Cohn had previously acted on behalf of Senator John McCarthy , during his famous witch-hunts in the 1950s. 
 Rumps contractors repeatedly repressed union activity, with violence, intimidation and by instant sackings if anyone attempted to Unionise. I can provide you with  FACTual details of this if you like.

I just don't think Trump has the qualifications to be president of anything, especially America.  He's basically applying for a job to be the figurehead of the most powerful nation on the planet, but he can barely maintain a professional candor, repeatedly loses his composure over stupid issues, and wastes time bullying or making fun of people like a child in middle school; nor does he seem to really understand the first thing about politics, economics, or legislation.

I think of it like this:
If you go into a place of business where you are applying for a job and during the interview, you made fun of the other applicants, expressed nothing but a lack of qualifications required for the position you are applying for and made a few racist (or ""vaguely"" racist) remarks, do you really think you would be hired anyway?  No, they would either laugh you out of the office and/or have security escort you off the premises - you'd be lucky if they didn't call the police and file a restraining order on you to boot.  (I'd have wedged something in there about inciting violence, but it didn't really fit into the metaphor I was using.)

That's basically how I think of Trump.  Now, I don't like Hillary Clinton either to be honest, I find her disingenuous on a good day and could go on a long rant on why I don't like her, but that's besides the point.",1

Hitler was Facist & a totalitarian for Germany... Not Russia. He tried to take over the world. Putin is communist and just wants his country to be left alone by the UN. He his very fond of the Russian heritage. 
There were 2 reasons he took Crimea from the Ukraine (And this is according the Australian news)... First because Ukraine owed Russia 10 billion in back payment plus interest. The second reason. Crimea was taken from Russia and given to the Ukraine. Crimea was the a home of the Russian Czars. Part of the Russian history & heritage... 
Ok, there was a 3rd... Crimea is a deep water port and a strategic point of Russia. Russia also had a 10 yrs contract for that port. The intern Ukrainian president told him he was breaking the contract... In essential the Ukraine violated the condition of said contract. Notice the UN nor the US tried to stop them nor did Russia further invade the Ukraine. 
That further proves your statement to be backwards.",0

Muslims do follow the teachings of Muhammad... I will give you that. However the are different sects of the same religion much like Catholic and Pentecostal. They both read from the same book but interpret it differently. How can two different tribes be called Muslim when the actual tribes are that such as Sunni & Shi'ite? The can't. they are different tribes that believe in Muslim beliefs as taught by Mohammad. Islamic faith is not the same faith as Muslims. Yet the media distorts that fact. Muslims like Islamics will pray 3 times a day. while Muslims know it is not right to attempt to institute their laws on those that do not follow Mohammad but they are by their laws to help their neighbors regardless. Islamic on the other hand believe you are to kill those that do not follow Mohammad. Yet the Koran says only that you have the right to take a life if one threatens your life or your families life or if the try to steal that which belongs to you which you have labored for. But it goes on to say - Yet wiser is the man who has this choice but choses not to take it. 
like those in the Middle East who cannot read and must rely on clerics you who do not know the difference must rely on the government... either way both are deceived. If you study propaganda you'll understand why the government is doing this. American propaganda vs Russian propaganda had shown how both sides used it to create hatred without cause for another. I see the same occurring again today. this time it's against those who follow Muslim vs Islam vs America. Which ones are killing? those that follow Islam. Islam makes up only 10% of all the Muslims.

Islam is a noun Muslim a verb according to websites. Yet in 2002 Sociology was saying that of all the Muslims in the world only 10% are Islamic. How can that be and how is it that even in Egypt they asked for assistance in stopping these Islamics. If I get this correctly the 10% that Sociology Today 2002 was referring to is what the Western society refers to as terrorists. My friends only told me they were Muslim they did not explain it beyond that other than their laws concerning taking life. In accordance with them and looking at how Mohammad Ali lived his life I would say my friends were telling the truth. They were not suppose to tamper with law of a society but it is their duty to worship God and help their neighbors where ever they might live.

The sheer hyprocricy of the man is staggering. As  I'm sure you know, he said of John Mccain. 'He's not a hero. He's not a war hero. He got captured. I prefer the ones who didn't get captured' . That was only in response to McCain criticising him , just like the worst hormone- affected adolescent. 
 I don't support too much of McCains political stance, but he truly suffered at the hands of the Vietcong, after his capture following being shot down on a bombing mission. After breaking several bones, nearly drowning, then being tortured, the Vietcong offered to release him as a propaganda coup : they had heard that 'Jack' McCain Sr had been promoted to the most senior naval officer in the region, in charge of all US forces in the theatre.  John Mccain refused, saying he would only leave if all US prisoners captured prior to him were released. And so his captivity, and torture, continued for several more years. 
 And in contrast, Rump used the pathetic excuse of a foot spur (or heel spur) to avoid the draft 5 times! He later couldn't recall which foot it was. Really Donald! The problem which actually prevented you from going off to fight in one of Americas most famous wars, and you can't remember which foot?! Rumps people later said it had been in both feet!

Grandiosity with expectations of superior treatment from others
Fixated on fantasies of power, success, intelligence, attractiveness, etc.
Self-perception of being unique, superior and associated with high-status people and institutions
Needing constant admiration from others
Sense of entitlement to special treatment and to obedience from others
Exploitative of others to achieve personal gain
Unwilling to empathize with others' feelings, wishes, or needs
Intensely jealous of others and the belief that others are equally jealous of them

However, a lot of that exists in Britain too, you probably won't be surprise to hear!. As a member and political activist of the Trades Union and Socialist Coalition party  (TUSC), here in the UK, I'm very well aware that there are other parties around, who just don't get the publicity of the long-established, and rich parties.  We are a relatively new party, only formed about 7 years ago and we've been trying desperately to get publicity . It is often like hitting a brick wall with the media. 
 One benefit, is that we do have the BBC over here, who are an entirely public funded broadcaster, so our designated 'leader' , Dave Nellist, has been interviewed twice on a national BBC political TV show. But, as far as I'm aware,  no other national broadcaster has granted him airtime so far- in 7 years! 

 I stood as a local TUSC council candidate at the 2014 regional elections, and will be standing for the TUSC as a local Member of Parliament  in 2020 (if the party will accept me of course!).  All TUSC parliamentary candidates have to stand on a platform of only accepting the average, local full-time workers wage- and not the MPs salary.  Whatever the difference is, this money goes to charity. This is what Dave Nellist did , every year, when he was a Labour Party MP from 1982 to 1991. No other British political party does this. 

I shall look into your Libertarian party further. I'd really appreciate it if you could do the same with the TUSC.

Yes-Of course I mean Fred Trump! Are you not aware of the word 'Rump' for the back end of an animal? It refers to the tough, most unpalatable and indigestible part. A fitting comparison I think. 
I have garnered my information from a number of different sources ( see further below). As it stands right now, you have given a reference to one source. 
Here are 2 quotes from -http://www.stephenfrasier.com/blog/writing/snopes-com-reliable-source/.;

'If the above is true (I think most of us can agree that it is), then folks who seek their answers from a single resource ‚Äì or from multiple resources within a single belief system, or holding a common worldview ‚Äì are simply not seeing the whole picture. Sadly, there are hordes of people in this category: people whose minds are closed to virtually all information that does not fit neatly within the narrow confines of their belief system. (What happened to reason? Why did the Age of Enlightenment have to end?)

No intelligent objective person would rely on a single, biased source for real answers to important questions ‚Äì and this is why I am urging readers to gather suggestions and conduct research from a variety of contrasting sources and viewpoints anytime the best answer to a complicated or difficult question is honestly sought. (Source: Search for Truth)'
Ostensibly , this site is actually supporting snopes.com,(!) but they clearly indicate the wisdom of a multi-reference, academic approach. 
By the way, even your Snopes.com reference admits that Fred Rump used the same lawyers as the other 6 men arrested :If he was an innocent bystander, caught up in it, why on earth would he use the same damned lawyers!??  Are you claiming that all 7 were innocent bystanders then? Snopes.com just says that it is unproven that Rump Sr was a member of the KKK, which is obviously true as he, and the others, were not actually taken to trial.  

If you have further sources to refer from to back up your argument that Fred Rump was not a KKK member,and was not arrested and charged as such,  (which you may well have), please can you provide them. 

Meanwhile, here's a list of just some my sources regarding Fred Rumps arrest ( and Donald Rumps highly dubious comments regarding the support recently offered to him by the present KKK grandees) -

 You clearly will never change your belief, no matter what weight of evidence is put against you. 
Have you read up on the childhood of the Rump siblings?  How oppressive it was. How they were so driven by Frederick  Rump sr. How Freddy Rump Jr ( 8 years older than Donald) was not as tough as the others as a child. he was more sensitive. He was forced to join in the family property business but never wanted to. He became an alcoholic as a teenager,but managed to extricate himself from the family business, got married, had a family, and became a TWA pilot . Sadly, the alcoholism and depression got the better of him and he died of it , aged just 43. 
 His own child ( Fred Jr), and Frederick Rump Srs grandchildren, were written out of Donald Rumps daddy's will entirely. This included a little grand child who had severe health problems.
When Freddy Jrs adult children attempted to sue, claiming that they had been written out of the will because of Donald influence ( and possibly the other Rump siblings too) on their then, alzeimer suffering, elderly father , this is how Donald reacted. He withdrew his previous generous payment of his deceased brothers grandsons expensive medical bills! . When later asked about it in interview, Rump replied  ''I got mad when they sued"" !!!!!!!.

The German people were socially and culturally primed by the Treaty of Versailles and Europe's anti-german sentiment to receive a leader like Hitler. Now as more and more people all over the world begin to realise that they are disenfranchised, our natural inclination (as evidenced for example by the rise of the Nazi party) is to band together with whatever cultural political identity we find solidarity in.

Are you really this pathetically ignorant? Academics acknowledge the wage gap, but they actually acknowledge the causal factors for it. The primary causers of the wage gap are men working more aggregate total hours (women tend to work significantly less due to maternity leave and having children), level of job competition (e.g. men DOMINATE the STEM and Finance fields, while women occupy less valued jobs like education), career field among other factors.

First off, I was just making a casual generalization. From my experience, most female STEM professors only teach at smaller, community colleges.

""But then again, what do trump sopporters know about logic. <3""

Also, actually, there is casualty when you look at admission requirements/standards for STEM students relative to whether they are a woman or a man.

That means it's a potential lurking variable, not likely to be a primary factor in the overall consensus, however. I will say this, yes, employers tend to discriminate to a marginal degree when they are looking for long-term employees, because women do have a much higher likelihood of abandoning their jobs in the short-term while pregnant or nursing. 

Also, there are plenty of counter-examples that show that institutionally placed quota and quasi-embargoes still give women unfair advantages in university admissions and job placement. Most engineering starting salaries are HIGHER for women (primarily to avoid risk of being sued for discrimination and to fit quota hiring standards) than they are men -- http://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/women-salaries-equal-outearn-men 

At the end of the day, we have not developed a system to manipulate our internal genomes to influence primarily innate factors that contribute to success, with the primary example being IQ, but other factors like height being significant as well. The amount of men in 80+ percentile of IQ compared to women is staggeringly high.

Because mainstream websites tend to assume status quo claims such as ""women are oppressed in everything"" as true regardless of whether the evidence supports it or not.

If anything, the burden of proof rests on you to provide evidence that the primary causer of the gender wage-gap is caused by discrimination. You've only linked me abstracts that claim they may only POTENTIALLY be lurking variables in the aggregate dilemma.

What ethnic discrimination has Trump supported?

Look at general brain MRI analysis, men have larger brains (varying from 10-25 percent), have over 5x as much grey matter, larger brain density etc.

Projected IQ is relatively fixed, especially after adolescence. No amount of education or mental exercises is going to make your IQ increase significantly. What can cause a significant change in overall IQ is age and brain development. 
>>""If, aged 40, you obtain the same absolute score on the same test as the score you had obtained at age 10, something would have gone seriously wrong in your life. The long-term stability of IQ means only that your standing relative to others of your age stays much the same.""

https://navigator1965.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/image1.jpg

http://www.boysadrift.com/2007Giedd.pdf



Actually, it's funny that you mention age demographics. Most of the popular IQ data sets (even the one I have been stating here)  quoted by scientists are tested on individuals in Westernized countries at the age of about -12- 11 year old children. Even though this heavily favors the female children (which the studies have denoted as ""women""), due to women having an earlier developmental advantage over men in adolescence -- the boys still outperformed the girls in upper IQ, even though the lower tail end was overestimated for men, because as stated earlier, girls have a faster developmental advantage over boys (they reach puberty faster, on average). 


Quoted from study, ""The observation that gray matter volumes peak approximately 1
to 2 years earlier in females than males, corresponding to the average age difference at puberty, is suggestive that the switch from progressively increasing to decreasing gray matter volume is associated with pubertal maturation.""

http://www.iqcomparisonsite.com/sexdifferences.aspx

Quoted from the study, ""Note that due to the seemingly unimportant slightly higher male average IQ, the extra male variability does not mean that there are many more mentally deficient males. Instead, the areas under the curve show that at the high extreme, such as the Mensa or gifted cut-off IQ of 130 (indicated by the red arrow) and above, there are significantly more males than females who qualify.""

You're not going to find a study that ""takes all variables into account"". However, if you find multiple studies converging on various different, said factors, then that's the closest you will get to it.

""Oh you can't remember? Silly you.
""And it‚Äôs probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks""""

This quote was taken out of context; it was incidentally sarcastic if you look at it in its entirety.

The entire quote: ‚ÄúBlack guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes‚Ä¶ Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else‚Ä¶Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that‚Äôs guy‚Äôs lazy. And it‚Äôs probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks.‚Äù 

Even if he was being completely serious (which I HIGHLY doubt), blacks are unarguably the single most minority that depends on government assistance at significantly higher proportions than any other minority in the U.S. This quote was also made in the 90's, where gang violence majorly contributed from African-Americans were at its highest. 

Think about this statistic for a second, 73% of black children are born out of wedlock. That easily leads to the majority of black children being raised by single mothers, who have a significantly high chance of receiving government assistance.

Look at the history of blacks in the stats and ask yourself the question why the social situation of blacks in the states might lead to that dependency on the government.

About trumps politics:
In some way, he is less extreme then many other republicans. I did look in some of his stuff and dislike many general ideas like further empowering the free market. You guys already managed to create the most hated company in the world, free markets have to be regulated in certain areas. 
But in my opinion, someone who is openly discriminating women, ethnics, nations and religions can't be president of the USA. It's that simple.

if your IQ is less than 140 you should nt be allowed to vote. I realize 
this may take out all the voters from some states, LIke caifornia, and 
Alabama and entire cities, But we need to get rid of the remedial 
voters. And leave the voting to those of us with genius level IQs.""

Your words, not mine. Nice back pedaling side step and non answer btw. Put that self proclaimed IQ to use.

I can agree for the most part with some of what you say - but lets ALLOW people to be responsible for themselves, not squalor within the same system that tells us ""we know what's better for you because we claim to be smarter"". Not perpetuate a system designed to take their wealth, and keep them down and then call them the problem. The U.S. is a corporation, so let it be run like a corporation - a corporation that is serving American's rather than stealing from them and enslaving them, and stop trying to legislate life.",0

and if you did not see I did say that they had to have High IQ but also a high Heart IQ. they cant be unwise or slouches. They have to be noble people. and not just noble on paper like we have now, because there aint shit noble about them. but true human nobleness.
My way is much better for everyone. and all people could have the same opportunity to follow their own purpose and evolve. Can you imagine how many genius minds are lost now because of money? because money is what dictates your opportunities on earth now, who gets to eat who doesnt. so lame... just such a lame and limiting existence we have now.

I will remember Mr. Trump he can't drive a country like a business, because we must give multiple chance for others to make it they way too. BUT, Mr. Trump is right! America must come back to American people's hands. I am from another country, and I got blessed by Georgetown University, AID, and MA Education Committee... And later Americans moved their business and jobs to China!!!! America, must return its own Industries, give job to American people, make good quality products with copyrights MADE IN AMERICA, and make business with Latin America and Canada, were American people expended their taxes investing in education, training and development, to help them, and to improve American's resources for decades. 
Now Americans have not jobs, they are importing bad quality products giving money away to China for it, and Latinos try to go to USA in worse conditions searching for something.  My best advice to American people; try, try, try, enforce, TO GENERATE LOCAL MICRO INDUSTRIES, ""BUY AND USE WHAT AMERICA PRODUCES"". Even if it is more expensive than a Chinese product, don't give your Dollars away, buy an American good product! (Your money and jobs, will stay at home).  If you need something from another country, remember the good democratic Latin American countries, with workers highly trained by USA, and with facilities already build by America there.
China build completed cities with no people living there yet. All with the money Americans buy from them, while in USA, there is not job, and no good quality tool to make a good job too! (This is the opinion from Somebody from Europe).",1,false,0,,,,,,

I understand why you are afraid and want to vote for a 'strong' candidate to ""remove"" these fears. People are afraid of what they don't understand. If you have never befriended a muslim person or a Mexican person or a black person, it's only natural you are afraid of them because you don't actually understand the kind of people they are. 
I live in a city; Atlanta Georgia where there are thousands of Mexicans and muslims and even Chinese people and because of this, I have been exposed to communicating with them, making friends with them, and even eating dinner with them in their own homes. My muslim friends all condemn Isis for what they are doing in fact just last week there was a parade of Muslims fighting against Isis image and extreme radicalism trying to spread the message that they do not and will not stand for terrorism. 

The muslims that you are referring to who ""have bomb making materials"" is such a minuscule minority of the muslim population that if you plotted it on a graph it would be smaller than a pixel. The only reason it seems like all muslims are this way is because of what the media covers. the media only covers the war and pain in the world because drama sells. so it makes sense that if every day you go home and see Isis on tv and news websites making huge claims like ""Isis could reach the US homeland by 2017!"", those are simply news agencies trying to come up with the most ""juicy"" stories they can to get you to click on their website, or watch their channel. most of the time these claims are not even valid and only speculations. 

So before you start judging people and vote for a president who will install laws that could ruin these people's lives based on what someone says who's job is to clearly make money, do your own research; get to know the members of that group and find out what they are really like and what they really stand for. You need to be more Sonder. 

Just remember human history and learn from it. This is exactly what Germany did with the jews back before ww2. this is how hitler made his rise to power. He used fear mongering to scare the public against the jewish population and he promised as dictator that he would remove the threat. germans bought into this and started fearing jewish people and happily accepted Hitler as their dictator if he would bring peace of mind to the people against the jews and amongst other things like ""making their country great again"" considering he also promised to pull the country out of the dark days of WW1 and the great inflation of 1921.",0

Reagan was actually one of the greatest presidents for his fiscal policies. He had some of the greatest real GDP growth percentage during his time in office in history of total presidencies. Morons like you do not understand that in the system of free-market Capitalism, you have to work for your keep and there will be competition -- leading directly to an imbalance of wealth. Under Communism and Socialism, no one gets rewarded for hard work, and people are actually incentivized to sit at home and live off of the government, because they'd be making the same amount as a hard-working, intelligent doctor, engineer, or businessman would.

Trump is not the problem, the problem is our government and the way it is ran ie. senate and the house. We gave the left 8 years and look at what they did.

He wants to terrorize all Islamic peoples even though less than 1% are radicals.

There was a phone interview in which he initially said it, and later at a Republican convention the moderators asked him if he really meant it and if he would like to take it back, and he just reaffirmed his stance. It was news a few months back, and using the obvious keywords (trump, terrorism, families, etc) in youtube or google searches should get you some information and videos showing him saying it. After several weeks of public concerned discussion on the matter, in which it was stated how unethical and what a bad idea it was, against the Geneva Conventions, discussion on whether the military would actually follow through with such a heinous act, etc, then Trump eventually softened his position on the matter, but it's clear he was only doing so because of the backlash he received and how indefensible that position is. The point is, he's a dangerous guy who in this situation, it seems, would only do some semblance of the right thing because he is pressured into doing so, not simply because it is the right thing to do. That's not the kind of person who should be in a position of power, and 10 times over especially not the person in charge of all of America's military forces.",0

Carbon Dioxide absorbs a much smaller spectrum of light than water vapor or methane gas. If we are going to worry about the CO2 emmisions by automobiles, then we should also worry about the H2O emmisions. This whole carbon emmisions deal is just like the second hand smoke scare of the 90s, the problem is hyperinflated by organizations who only exist because of said problem. They're also funded by the government who just wants to tax tobacco/gas higher. There is no question that second hand smoke is bad, or that high amounts of carbon dioxide can assist climate change. However, the media, and the government, seeks to demonize these things to allow for greater taxation. When the government raises taxes tobacco or gas, they usually have a plan with the proceeds of the taxation. Maybe they will build some roads, or bail out some auto companies. However, if the government is planning to make a profit off of the sale of the gas/tobacco, their goal was not to lower gas consumption, it was just to get more money for dem programs. It is pretty simple economics. The demand for both of these products is pretty inelastic, so government forced price hikes do not effect consumption rate, allowing the government to take in some pretty pennies.",3

The sad fact the internet is not honest... especially when propaganda of any type comes into play.¬† History of the smoking corporation has shown us that we can ""prove"" anything we want when cherry picking findings and frontloading the studies how we want to.¬† That said there are a few criteria that I usually look to when evaluating ""scientific findings"":

1.¬† Does it help someone make money?¬† In this case both sides of the argument would say ""yes"".
2.¬† Does it support information that people WANT to hear?¬† If we are causing the destruction of the earth, I think people wouldn't like it... so that's actually a reason to believe it has credibility.
3.¬†¬†Does one side use ""public opinion"" as a credible reason to believe it?¬† Global warming deniers constantly do this... which causes that argument to loose credibility.
4.¬†¬†What is the worst case scenario?¬† If Global warming deniers are wrong the consequences could be catastrophic, whereas if Global warming supporters are wrong, they just get better at being independent from non-renewable resources.

Personally I think it's a danger to not consider the (frankly overwhelming) amount of scientists - both motivated and independently studied - that support the Global warming concerns.. but if you don't think that is credible, I hope the above reasons may at least give you pause.",0

If you look at this trusty Bing images graph, there seems to be a correlation between CO2 and temperature, right? But, the temperature rises before the CO2 does. Is CO2 magically bending time? Or can we reach the more logical conclusion that as temperatures rise, the planet becomes more hosptibale to CO2 emitting life? And if your model is true, why hasn't the temperature spiked sharply along with the CO2 rise as marked in the graph? Because CO2 is simply an unimportant greenhouse gas.

Do you agree that CO2 causes pollution?  Do you agree that CO2 pollution is bad for the heath of humanity?  Then why are you making the argument that this is a good thing?

Further, yes... energy comes from somewhere.  In fact there is a substantial amount of energy that is not being all around us.  The idea with ""renewable"" energy is to use that constantly present potential energy to our advantage... so no.. it's not a myth. 

The reason that many people want to use ""non-renewable"" resources is simple: they don't take as much effort to use.  History has already done most of the work for us to make it potent.  The problem is... simple does not always = best.  Along with the energy we get, we also get byproduct.  This has negative effects on our environment and our health.  Because of this, I believe COMPLETELY that is in humanities best interest to look into alternative fuels. Are they as efficient yet?  PRETTY FLIPPIN CLOSE and THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER.  But no... currently history still provides the best energy.  But where there is a will there is a way.  PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO WILL TO CHANGE.

But the government shouldn't force it on false charges. It should become viable when mining fossil fuels becomes more expensive than these other sources. 
CO2 is not a relevant greenhouse gas. Maybe the myth was started by people more intelligent than you or I to try and jumpstart renewables. I would applaud them. But the more likely reason is to aid big energy companies in getting those tax breaks. The government shouldn't be meddling in what are currently private enterprises.

A few things:  

Firstly:  You have more faith in humanities ability to change than I do.  Personally I think most people would allow themselves to be boiled alive rather than get out of a pool (metaphorically).

Secondly:  Do you really think that investing in alternative fuels is cost effective?  Keep in mind... this is assuming that there is NO REASON to doubt the stability of fossil fuels.  Answer:  NO.  There IS NO REASON that oil companies would spend money on an alternative fuel source that has NO BENEFITS above the CURRENT fuel source they have established.  This means no financially sound company would invest in this (again, assuming fossil fuels are stable).  BUT THERE ARE... IN FACT ALL OF THEM ARE.  This means our premise must be false (or put more simply EVEN OIL COMPANIES REALIZE THAT OIL ISN'T A STABLE FORM OF ENERGY IN THE LONG TERM.",0

*John R. O'Donnell, a former president of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino, wrote in his 1991 book Trumped! that Trump frequently used racial slurs, he also described a dinner conversation with Trump in which, he writes, they discussed Trump Plaza's financial executive, who was black. He quoted Trump as saying he never liked the man and believed he was not doing a good job. Trump's conversation is recounted:

""And isn't it funny. I've got black accountants at Trump Castle and Trump Plaza. Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day. . . . I think the guy is lazy. And it's probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It's not anything they can control.""*

The real issue isn't Muslims or Immigrants
its the 1% controlling 99%.
its the ability to put food on the table.
its the ability to work, earn a decent wage and have a dignified life.

Everything else is smoke screen.",0

Trump talking points to about blacks I more akin to booker t Washington and mlk. We look at context of character vs color of your skin. 

People love to say he went and bankrupt so he would be bad to have as a present. One of my teachers said to me once if u hire a lawyer look for one who failed his license exam a few times. Why? Because he had to study twice as hard and he knows personally know what failur feels like. So he will make sure he will prove his case. 

As for trump. Everything is image for him. If he fails yeah he can get paid even if he was a bad president. But if he was one of the best in the past 30 years? That will almost immortalized him. Not only that his own business value will sky rocket. With that his kids with his teaching can also make a mad amount of money. With that he saves the economy then his major assets which is land will grow in value. People can earn more thus",0

the problem with this kind of research is that you can get it to show pretty much anything, and those research centers agree this is so. I think you're right when you say it's debatable and pretty much impossible to prove.

I don't think democrats - or socialists - are stupid, far from it, and I know a lot of them are really good people who only want the best for everybody. But I do think they don't know what they're getting themselves into should they succeed. Why do I know?

When you sympathizers of the no regulation at the borders get raped I won't be laughing I would mourn for you stupidity.

Voting for other candidates besides Trump means you are pro free border crossing and you are pro for criminals and terrorist alike to cross the border without regulation.",0

I dont believe he will save this country and quite frankly I have zero tolerance for any patriotism going on now because how can anyone be proud of what kind of country America is now. there's more sin than ever more crime more drugs more poor more lust more of everything we stood against so long ago. if you're the average American a guy like Trump excites you because you see the way it use to be the way we use to think know as Americans and that's why people like him. he's not a scrooge he's made terrible investments before so he's not perfect nor is he Jesus christ he's simply a man that's held the same values for the last 30 years and now he's challenging the ways things are in america because he's sat there and watched this nation burn it's ways for the last 30 years and like most people excluding the last generation or so of Americans are sick and tired of this God awful thinking as well. don't get your gun go vote for this man because he will make America great again. we wake up eat out breakfast start our chores go to work come home make dinner for the family and pray together and enjoy each other's lives without the need for some gimmick likes phones or TV to allow ourselves to love one another and appreciate each other's need for the other. things use to be simple now it's a ball of mess and it's been rolling down the same hill for too long it's time to clean up and break chains because we use to be the envy of the world and now everyone's laughing at us and it's our big government fault but it's the people who trust it at fault as well.,0

Obama's IQ is only 130, Donald probably has a higher one. mine blows all of you away. so yeah I worry that dummies are running things and the majority is made up mostly of idiots.

and here is your enlightenment... none of it even matters, you vote for whoever they say your gonna vote for. you should have that figured out already. They parade the talking monkeys in front of the camera, and then they tell you who is running, and thats all you get a choice of. But both sides are controlled by the same money. This time though, Trump has his own money, he isnt taking half a billion dollars from the saudis like Hilary and what he says is true. Hilary went from, ""i believe marriage ia between a man and a women"" to ""yay, gay marriage"" for what? so america likes her,
she is fake, at least Donald is honest and people don't like honesty.
also it is so much easier to lie and have a nation believe you than to get that nation to realize they have been lied to for a very long time.
so believe whatever you want to believe. I will stick to what I have observed and experienced and the conclusions i have come to that when dummies run the world, and even dumber dummies vote for them and support them, things end up in the toilet.
And even the entities that truly control everything aren't geniuses. they are just a wee bit smarter than the average joe. and they have no ethics so I guess what will happen is kind of deserved. Unless the real geniuses stop the bs in its tracks.",0

she didnt hide them, she erased them after she was caught.

She also is on board with bringing in islamic refugees while supporting gay rights?????? wtf? muslims think killing gays gets them to heaven, and gays are.. well gay. so thats not going to mix well. but the dummies wont see that.
so i figured you were very young, european kids are more mature than american kids and far more educated...so you are probably at the same level as americans in their 20s. which you can credit to Hillary also with her ""no child left behind"" policy which only served to bring the level of academia so low that the least intelligent children could pass the tests. so sad. and now thei common core education is making our kids even dumber.

Everyone grows and develops and changes, and she deserves us taking that into consideration - it was ages ago! Just like we should not have to dig up these old clips as presented in this video about Trump in order to find something worthy and substantial.

""we will be as defenseless against our oppressors as you are in UK""... You aren't defenceless if there is nothing for you to be defending yourself from, i.e. other people with guns. I can understand that you may feel safer if you have a gun to protect yourself with, however if you apply strict gun rules, then you won't have to defend yourself against anything. Guns are made to murder. Where there is a gun involved, someone always gets hurt. There is no such thing as a hero behind the gun. The UK has had 7 shooting massacres since 1849, the US has had 7 since MONDAY. Just let that sink in for a moment. Do we really seem that defenceless?

Thirdly, you simply cannot group together an entire religion - it is prejudice and discriminatory. Sure, the Quran does say that being gay is a terrible sin, but that does not mean that all Muslims follow that belief. If you want to play that ball game, we should be kicking out all the Christians too, because in Paul's letters he condones slavery. But you never even considered that prospect, did you?  Islam is all about love and peace and respect, and we need to make sure we do not confuse ISIS with Islam; that would be a bit like confusing Christianity with the KKK - but they are totally different.

I was again not familiar with the NCLB policy, however I did research it and this is the definition I found: ""The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is a federal law that provides money for extra educational assistance for poor children in return for improvements in their academic progress. NCLB is the most recent version of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act."" This is nothing to do with lowering the standards, it is about providing extra tutoring and support to those who need help, screening teachers to make sure they are well qualified, etc. If anything it was enabled to RAISE the standards of education by improving the performance of the lowest achievers to meet a higher bar, not lowering the level of academia so that everyone can pass. And were you not brought up in this system yourself? If so, then would you not be just as 'undereducated' as you claim current students are? I also thought I would tell you that I used to go to an American - based school before entering the English system. Although approaches were rather different, the general information that is being taught is at a pretty similar level - some were more challenging, some less. That has been my experience at least.

And lastly, I have a question - this is genuine I am not being sarcastic - if you truly believe that all the president does is interrupt your ball games with speeches, then why do you care so much who is elected? Why vote? If that is the case, just turn the volume off until they're done, simple as.",0

It is not only disrespectful of you, but it is downright vulgar and a shameful attitude. You do not have the right to hurt another being, and by bearing arms, you do just that. As I said previously, guns are for killing. Therefore, no you do not (or unfortunately in this case SHOULD not) ""have the right to bear arms"". It only causes yet more unnecessary destruction. And even if you multiplied 7 by 50 (for each state), it would mean 3500 massacres since 1849, if you look up how many massacres have occurred in the US since 1849, you will only find articles talking about how many massacres have occurred in the US this YEAR (6 months so far), which is 140. If you want to get technical about it, that would hypothetically mean 280 massacres a year, 3500/280=12.5, which means that in theory, at this rate, America would have had the same amount of massacres that England has had multiplied by 50 in the past 167 years, in 12.5 years alone. I rest my case.

Yes, in 2005 the supreme court ruled that the police did not have to answer calls for help. It is terrible and I do not understand it, however it is completely irrelevant to this current conversation as firstly, as you said, it was ruled by the supreme court and secondly, Bush was president at the time, and although he was not a great president, he is nothing to do with what we are talking about, so... don't really know where you were going there. Also using the whole 'Hitler used it and look how that turned out' argument is just dumb. Hitler also wanted to kick out all the Jews because he said they were the whole source of the problem and hey! Donald Trump is saying the exact same thing about Muslims. But you still want him to be president, don't you? A little bit hypocritical if you asked me....

And the whole 'they left your country because of how bogus your system is' thing? Again, am seriously face-palming right here. The US left the UK due to unfair taxations on them, primarily, and many people left the UK to the US due to religious prosecution at the time. How ironic. Also, this was over 200 years ago. Both systems have changed completely since then, so this was a pretty naive argument.
Weren't you the one talking about how the education was so much better over here? It's clearly showing through with your shallow and immature responses.

""if they kicked them all out with the muslims and jews, that would be fine with me. "" - again, a pretty disgusting attitude. You are clearly a person who is full of hate and probably self-loathing too, if you feel this much anger and negativity to so many people that you have never even met. Geez, it actually makes me pity you. I genuinely hope that you get past this and learn love; you definitely need it. It also struck me that someone who is rooting for a president who wants to GET RID OF GUN CONTROL IN SCHOOLS is saying that religious people believe in crazy stuff. It blows my mind!

""Lots of robberies get stopped by regular people with guns but no one wants that getting n the news."" Uuuughhh I am seriously getting sick of your petty excuses. Yeah, I'm sure that robberies get stopped by people with guns. How? by killing the robber. No one deserves to die for stealing. Sure, it is very wrong, but killing is a much more evil deed. These stories do go in the news; the local news, because usually there are much worse massacres occurring on a national scale to reach the bigger headlines. Smh.

No, minorities do not think that Trump is going to kick them all out - that is much too broad a statement. However he does say that Mexico 'doesn't send it's best', that 'they are bringing drugs... crime'. He does not specify that they are illegal or not, and he insinuates that most of them are dangerous. This is discriminatory and Mexicans have every right to find this offensive. Pretty much every American except for people of native american descent have ancestors who, at some point, immigrated there. Imagine we had had this policy from the beginning? If you want to look at it that way then Christopher Columbus was also an illegal immigrant lmao. ""Most of these guys are also committing crimes here of various sorts but mostly they are sex crimes like rape or murder."" Wowwww that was probably the lowest you've stooped so far. Seriously? Gosh you just absorb all of DJT's lies don't you? For 2013 (the most recent year available), it shows that whites accounted for 71 percent of all sexual assaults documented (above their total percentage of 63 percent of the U.S. population), while Latinos accounted for 9 percent, far below their total percentage of 17 percent. What was that you were saying about Mexicans and rape crimes? Lol at least do a bit of research before spurting whatever comes to your simple brain. And then you have the audacity to say that MEXICANS are racist? Smh I cannot believe you.

Next, the NCLB - my question is what does Hillary have to do with this? Sure, she voted in favour of it, but as you said, it looked good on paper. It's not like she devised it or had anything to do with carrying it out, so I don't see why you are blaming her.

I also thought I should note that we are not taught anything about American politics WHATSOEVER and are actually taught very little about the politics here either. I only know what I do because I take interest in it. It is not down to the education system at all and I doubt that you could have this conversation with anyone else at my school either for exactly this reason.

Also do you really think that Donald Trump is going to be representative of the people? He is sexist, racist, and generally discriminates against anyone who is not like him. How is he going to be representative of them? Is he really going to be a good delegate to, for example, women, when he says things like, ‚ÄúYou know, it really doesn‚Äôt matter what the media write as long as you‚Äôve got a young, and beautiful, piece of ass.‚Äù I mean, really?",0

Hilary wrote the nclb BS. and secondly, you totally did not understand what I meant by having a thing for guns. I have never harmed anyone or anything with or without a gun, but i will need one to defend against the criminals who do have them. and by criminals i mean everyone from thugs to high up positions. if they want to take the guns of the american people they eill have to put away first. it is stupid that the government can have all that they have and have gun toting body guards while they ask us to stand defenseless.
why do schools get shit up here? because they are gun free zones. killers know they cant do shit! easy target. it is stupid. Maybe if teachers and principals carried weapons that shit would not happen. if a ""good citizen"" was carrying an arm in that night club that dude would have been taken out a whole lot faster, wouldnt you think? or the people in paris? if french people could have gun then criminals could not just walk in and kill people like that, not as many anyway.

I would never attack anyone, but I will damn sure protect myself and anyone else who needs defending from harm.
so your socialist view point is duly noted, but I am not going to give up my rights just because some people are fucking insane.
ANd just for the record, mexico does not send its best. the best stay there and live good lives. the ones that come here are not all criminal minded but enough are to raise concern. Plus all that gang shit with the latin kings and human trafficking and the MS 13 and all that, it is no good. and all that is also government funded. if you have not heard about it look up fast and furious. not the movie. the gun deals . and all that comes from allowing the back and forth and compliant farmers and banks and how easy you can get welfare over the damned phone now. you dont even need to go in. so IDK what you been reading or what you have been taught or shown about America, but it sounds like you are getting the same propaganda machine that is all over the media.",0

It would be completely counter productive to allow guns in schools. What if a teacher gets pissed off and decides to shoot a kid? I guarantee it will happen if they allow guns in schools. Besides, some of the massacres have been from KIDS bringing in guns! What do you think will happen when they actually allow guns on campus? It would be completely disastrous.

You have to remember that by allowing ""good citizens"" easy access to guns, then it makes it a hell of a lot easier for crazies to get ahold of them too.

really? if someone is comng to hurt me, i will hurt them. I have never hurt anyone yet is what I am saying because I have never had to. see? No one gets on switzerlands ass for everyone in the country having a gun and kids learning to take rifles apart and put them back together in relay races in first grade over there.
If someone breaks into my home and i dont have a gun and they do, then what?
Are you even reading what I am writing?
you seem to live in a fear controled state of being. no matter how hard they make it for ""good citizens"" to buy arms, the bad guys will not ever have these problems. they will always be able to get guns. even if they outlaw them for everyone else. so that argument does not work in reality..
and i have read all that you say, i just think you are indoctrinated in a socialist mindset that has nothing to do with how things really are in america. it is fact and you can look up fbi stats, cities with gun control have the highest rates of murder and rape because people have no means to stop them and cops never get there on time. and i already explained the supreme court decision of 2005. anyway. some americans will fall for the commie bs but some of us wont. the government is a corporation known as the Vorginia Company and we dont have to consent to their corporate codes any more than we have to listen to walmart.

More material possessions, more money, the go must always be in a state of continual wanting and desire for something other than what they have in order for capitalism to flourish. Without ego in this state, capitalism would not be a viable model. Fortunately the human conditioning is such that ambition and drive for money and possessions are seen as positive attributes and so capitalism will continue to flourish. This behaviour is of course objectively insane but whenever one looks to the history books, human behaviour was always insane. Ours is no exception and those who read back on the history of capitalism in 1000 years will see it as such.",0

The only reason people keep besmirching the Confederacy with slavery (even though they also had it in the Union) is to cover up the war crimes of Abraham Lincoln (another great divider in chief) and General Sherman.  

A few years ago they recovered a Confederate ironside ship from some river, and our government classified it as a ""captured enemy vessel.""  That's how they view us.

You're putting your image, character, and integrity on the line when you speak in front of/for other ppl, esp on the world stage and as President of the US. You saying ""He was never racist until he ran... etc."" is a poor assessment on your part. The fact is, he might have been internally racist his whole life in business and society. You wouldn't know unless you knew him. He never spoke it (until he was put on the world stage), but he acted in those ways subtly and by his thinking. And it DOES matter that we as the people point it out. We need to be smart about who we elect. Just because he's hoo-rah about everything and threatens traditional politics, and speaks his mind mind half-assedly doesn't make him fit for office and for this country. 
I'm not declaring that being racist is the worst sin in the world and all should be condemned, but let's face it, there are a whole host of other reasons why fcking Donald Trump shouldn't be in the office.

Blue collar white Americans, redneck Confederate rebels, and wealthy conservative businessmen. No professional working class minority supports this guy, and of they do, they are misguided by rhetoric.
Trump is also a major hypocrite. Any world class businessman would outsource labor and capital if it was available cheaper elsewhere. It's not rocket science. You cannot talk about bringing jobs back to America while discussing growing the American economy. Most tech, chemical and materials manufacturing is done in foreign countries. If he brought all that back to the US (which he won't) he will be raising the cost of labor for businessmen such as himself while simultaneously raising the prices for consumers.

One of the biggest reasons conservatives hate Obama is because he's a Muslim sympathizer, and some even say that he is in fact a Muslim. Today, many conservatives support Trump. So what did Trump have to say about Christian Bush and 'Muslim Obama' after Obama was elected?
Another trump quote, this from National Review:
In a TV interview shortly after the 2008 presidential election, at the height of Obama euphoria, Trump lavished praise on the president-elect and slammed outgoing President Bush as ‚Äúevil.‚Äù ‚ÄúI think he has a chance to go down as a great president,‚Äù Trump said of Obama. ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs going to lead through consensus.‚Äù Bush, by contrast, he described as ‚Äúmaybe the worst president in the history of this country,‚Äù who was ‚Äúso incompetent, so bad, [and] so evil.‚Äù
So Trump says Muslim Obama has a chance of being a great president and Christian Bush is evil. And Trump, like every other informed person, knew Obama was an Illinois Senator and that his voting record was ultra liberal. And now conservatives support Trump? You know what Americans suffer from? Battered wife syndrome. Of course they'll claim they're simply being politically astute and choosing the lesser of two evils. Aside from that damnable self-fulfilling prophecy, most of them will be lying. Most of them believe Trump, love Trump and want Trump...in their rump.",0

LOL and still your sorry-ass failed! 

 None of those links...which mostly just come from one website, ReligionofPeace.com (A site that looks like it mostly just bashes Islam and Muslims anyway...and one that doesn't even look remotely credible either), proves your stupid comment that the Majority of Muslims are terrorists.       Sure they show the RISE in attacks, but where does it say that the Majority of Muslims are show to be terrorists? Lol in fact I went a little skimming on that site and I saw an article showing there is a Minority of Muslims that support terrorism. Which no duh, of course there is going to be a minority.   And even still, those attacks were done either by a small cell or single individuals; like with the shooting in Florida, which I see you almost used as some sort of fact.

Face it you just need to shut up. You only proved that with the increase of the Muslim population, the number of attacks have increased.

Seriously if the Majority of Muslims were terrorists(not supporters, we are talking about the ones who want to do harm to others, not support it), then there should a much much higher number of attacks.

So no I have no intention of shutting up.  Miss-informed idiots like you deserve to be rightly mocked.

Not that HRC is much better though...... Bernie has also been consistant, but he doesn't play dirty. The only reason he didn't win the election is because of the Super delagets and the lack of press coverage, esp in the first three months. Wasn't there a 3rd candidate for a while as well? No press what so ever. How do Americans really know who to trust and not. All news networks have their political agenda and most important, money from the ratings of putting Trump on 24/7. Some ppl really believe Obama is evil, a Muslim even (lol) and he tanked it, when the country is actually in an upward spiral, slowly, but steady and to begin all over again will cost only the ppl more of their hard earned money. Did he do all he wanted to accomplish, no, but not coz he didn't want to, but first of all, no President can forsee the real job until you're doing it and with all the obstructionism of the Repulsive Party, his hands were often tight. Put the blame where it belongs and that's maybe on both sides partly the case, but there are enough good ppl as well, like Elizabeth Warren, who calls Trump out without any fear or hesitance, coz she knows that his message is not what America used to be about.

But Trump as a businessman, any respectable business man would have done the same in his position and a lot often did. But of course he seems ""bitter"" to you, you haven't had to deal with the stubborn ideology held by people in positions of power in the business world, or people saying you're something when you're not.

I like Bernie too, but to consider Hillary as his replacement...

Democracy has lost it's meaning in the United States. When you realize all of this and much more you start awakening and we can begin to protest, not with violence, but with EDUCATION. That is my point. Education is everything. When we can reach the positions of who controls us we can start controlling ourselves. There are so many things that we can do to change our economic system and the whole system in general. We can start by not giving our money to the rich! By actually giving a shit on who we spend our money on. This is the system they built, work and spend. That's all we fucking do. You go buy groceries from Wal Mart and you're still giving back your money to them. I don't understand what there is to be confused about. It would be idiotic to try to explain everything to you in one paragraph, as there is so many things behind the government and ourselves to understand. I suggest you do your research and perhaps attend a university economy class. And maybe read some Aristotle, because that's where it all begins. I seriously wish you luck.",0

So are you saying those 1.5 million skilled workers should suffer for the collapse of an economic bubble orchestrated by a small few? Wow, and you tell me to learn economics...

There's super rich people whose parents left their children their wealth so they could have a better chance of not living in a cardboard box? Is that wrong? By that logic if you receive your parents belongings in a will they should belong to the state and not you. Family heirlooms which survived the holocaust to be passed down generation after generation by that logic, should be melted down and used to feed the homeless. Not happening.

Students graduate into debt? True, but only if they choose high income fields which if they weren't too busy partying and buckled down and worked through college they could reduce that debt and then after college have it payed off in less than a year.

And stuck there? Not really. Everybody has a choice and most people are choosing work entitlements and benefits over traveling around the world to work minimum wage in an unstable job market. Same reason why a lot of people don't try get into a new relationship when they've hit 40 and the person they're dating is a complete and utter tool. Fear of rejection and competition of younger competitors.

Democracy is democracy, it was always the populist vote that secured the seat. As these people have trained themselves to cater to wills of the many, not the few.

""Not giving our money to the rich"", money is inconsequential and actually if you provide a decent business model, you too could be fabulously rich over night. Rich people are rich because they are good at what they do, and what they do is provide a service you are willing to pay for. Whether it be your iphone or the car you drive. You are always going to be giving money to someone who is richer than you. And that money is always put back into the system through the creation of more jobs to provide more services. It's called expanding your business, common that's ""economics"" 101.

Read the teaching of a man born into a society where people beat each other over the heads with rocks and try to apply it to the modern world we live in? That's called the spread of abstract ideology and is how ISIS ended up spreading like a cancer. And tell me to work up a basic understanding of global economic trade behaviors and that i'm somehow an idiot because I don't subscribe to your bullshit? Lady, you're fucking retarded if you think i'm going to let that passive aggressive insult slide.

Ok now that i'm done addressing your points I can finally make mine. I believe in equal possibilities to be made for people willing to put in the effort to work for it. I believe we should work for ourselves first before we decide to take up the mantle to help others (like a typical rich person you demonize). I believe we should work to provide a society which seeks to provide services which can be utilized, NOT ABUSED for lazy individuals to give themselves a running start without intending to buckle down and work through it. I believe we should clean up the planet and any small businesses should seek to change their business models or suffer for it, like a restaurant in the 1960's which didn't allow black people to dine in their establishment, deciding to continue that behavior out of pure ignorance and stubbornness and inability to change despite all the warning signs. I believe politicians should receive a wage which more suits their position at -50% less and their incomes and all assets to be made open to the public, and failure to declare all assets would lead to criminal indictments, so as to prevent corruption by removing the possibility of bribery and to discourage people who are unsuitable for a position in politics who are essentially sociopaths from seeking the job for the benefits. I have a dream, that one day this world will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."" Do you know what Martin Luther meant by that? That good people should actually do good and that people should be true to their word, instead of being passive aggressive.

You are still very young and have yet to understand how the world works or how you even change it. It starts by being critical of everything around you but still being able to supply a realistic compromise. It's nice to have dreams, but if you cannot materialise those dreams, what else are you doing besides daydreaming? Take affirmative action don't just fucking talk about it like a barely out of college airheaded idiot who's just jealous of other people.",2

Reckless?  Pilots?  Oh that happens all the time with actually reckless celebs who have private planes and overload them like with Aaliyah and others who pushed too far in bad conditions.
Reckless is Hillary Clinton's mentor, Angela Merkel who has helped destroy europe and her own country through mass migration of people who are incompatible with western cultures, especially a western culture subverted by leftist marxism.   The migrants see weak people who believe in nothing, a leader disgusted by her own flag, never mind her own people, and they exploit it, because it disgusts them.  You saw it yesterday, even in a second generation the seed of disgust takes hold and the reaction..the regressive reaction of ""they didn't do nuffin"" ""not all muslims"" and even ""he's not a real muslim or a muslim at all"" only disgusts his ilk even more.  They can tell you to your face while they take their time slowly killing people they hate over 3 hours that they are doing it for their religion and you will see the left grovel to defend them, denying the problem all together to divert into other issues like gun control, like they are desperately doing right now, with their ""its about hate"" which is a way to exclude the subjects they cannot mention from the discussion.  This regressive left which cannot stare reality in the face, this regressive left which has lgbtqiak groups attempting to add Islam to that letter soup, in complete denial that they are embracing one of the most homophobic religions around, proven not only by pew polls but by actions.  You see these reckless regressives bring up the westboro baptist church and other nonsense to try to claim a false equivalence, when they are comparing a group which throws gays off roofs to people who do nothing but troll using paper signs. This is all done in the face of 50+ people being slaughtered, reckless?  The left has lost complete grip on reality, and that is the most dangerous condition anyone can be in, the left is currently in the throes of a psychotic break, they are nihilistic and dangerous and more and more people are starting to see it.  So don't talk to me about ""reckless"".
People like me didn't help fight against the christian right to watch the left embrace the islamic right, they have lost their minds.  It's time for Trump,  behind the bluster lies a reasonable man, while behind the facade of decorum of the left lies madness.
and that's not even getting into her reckless exposure of email and state secrets, god knows who has those now, and how its being used as blackmail.  She was reckless, and is now a danger to the country.  She lied about her health and probably suffered a stroke a while back as well, again, putting her ego before the country as her judgement is now probably compromised, her mask of staged control has slipped several times during the campaign.  She's either compromised or a puppet.",2

You're absolutely delusional if you think everyone on the left-end of the political spectrum holds the same beliefs. You sound to me that you're more of a contrarian who would rather go against the grain for the sake of being different and edgy rather than subscribing to any reasonable rationale.

White liberals I know don't apologize for being white, and I don't even fall into the category of ""white liberal"". Once again, you think you've successfully combated every differing leftist ideology to your own by savagely swinging your keyboard like ""MUH VIEWS. MUH VIEWS."" There is no general ""left insanity"" to apologize for being white, you deranged nimrod. Once again, you're stereotyping the left as adhering to this white-guilt notion, when in reality many of them do not. Additionally, a lot of liberals are minority themselves-- why would you even assume that I'm white? I don't even know where that conclusion ever came from.

The only reason you put yourself on a higher pedestal than others with different ideologies is because it's your own ideology. You really think ALL leftists are the same? Don't make me fucking laugh.

You're trying to take some sort of intellectual high-ground when in reality all you've done is abstain from the conversation (likely because all you do is repeat yourself and you're either only arguing with the worst of the left or aren't open to differing arguments)-- making you look even dumber and willing to be ignorant, as well as arrogant, in the process. Go ahead, make the argument that supporting gay/trans rights will automatically lead to pedophilia and bestiality being supported by the left. You can't.

It's struck me that the reason that you can't seem to find a fruitful discussion is probably because you rely on fallacies like this to support your own bastardized viewpoint of the world. Go ahead, wallow in your own beliefs-- leave constructive discussion to the adults.

And by the way, if Trump wins the Presidential election, I won't like it, but I sure as hell won't be one of those douchebags that protests him or rips up his signs.

No offense Bcutter, but it doesn't take much effort to believe, either you do or you don't! Your belief in Him does not depend on what other people say or what other people believe. It is totally up to you!¬† I see this comment a lot, that God is a sadistic asshole ?? how ?? what has God done to you to make you feel that way? Has someone you loved died? It is appointed for man to die once then the judgement. Everybody has a relative or friend who has died. Believers and non believers alike. No one is exempt. AND IT HURTS EVERYBODY to lose someone they love. Gods only Son died too. In the most horrible way possible.God is no stranger to heartbreak... he suffers everyday with it. He suffers rejection everyday!! Yet God is not forcing you to believe or disbelieve. He is respecting your free will to CHOOSE... Religious people? Religion is a device of man! All you need to believe is a free will! You have one of those yes? Don't listen to the opinions of men! Get yourself a bible, read it, Ask God to show you. Trust me, when you call out to God He will answer you. He will answer you in your particular way of understanding. Its different for everybody. Some need loud thunderous voice from heaven. Others need to hear the whisper. Some need signs! God will never ignore a genuine request for His presence. Maybe He is talking to you right now in these words? I am usually a shy reserved person, but God is my passion and if even one word I write gets through then its worth my discomfort of speaking out. This is not easy for me. God is a loving God despite what the ""religious people"" tell you. You must remember one thing. All those people who stand up in the front of a congregation, they are human just like you and me. Not all of them have the right answers. If you genuinely are seeking God, He will reveal himself to you. Joel 2:32 ANYONE WHO CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD (JESUS CHRIST) WILL BE SAVED.",2

But let me give a lengthy reply :) I do not believe in free will, what would free will even mean? I have yet to meet someone who can define ""free will"" without running into contradictions or just plain lingual barriers. Say you make a decision in a particular situation. Now assume we were able to rewind the universe to the exact same state as before the decision, wouldn't you make the very same decision again? After all, it's the exact same situation and you have the exact same prerequisites. So yes, obviously you would make the same decision again, because your decisions are based on your previous experiences in life and your previous decisions. And all those previous experiences and decisions were consequences of even earlier experiences and decisions, and you can go back like that all the way to the day you were born. So even though we ""feel"" as if we have ""free will"", we really don't.  And that's why I think God must be a sadistic asshole. I have been told he is omnipotent. This means he can forsee the future. This means that at the moment he created the first human, he knew that for example Jimmy from Idaho would kill his wife and therefore be sent to hell. But if Jimmy was predestined to kill his wife, how can it be his fault? And why would God send Jimmy to hell for something Jimmy was predestined to do and therefore could not prevent?  Now if God can NOT tell the future, that means he is not omnipotent, and then he's basically just a kid with too much power, creating mankind as a science project and has his fun by throwing people who randomly turn out to be ""bad"" in hell. And again, at the most profound level, no one is responsible for what they do. We humans only perceive it as such, because we are very simple, but something as complex as a God would understand this, and if that God was good, he would never throw anyone in hell for something they were not responsible for.",0

Its a gift from God. As is His sacrifice for us!  We are born to parents who exercise it. We are nurtured and trained in the way we should go ( in an ideal world) and when we reach maturity we exercise our free will. We choose to live here, love that person. make these friends. etc etc etc Yes there is suppression and oppression in this world but we still have a free will. Nothing happens to us that we don't somewhere along the line allow to happen. Either directly or indirectly. You see it all the time in fiction tv shows. Where they make a time line of events and decisions that lead to a specific event. .... free will in action. You are making a free will choice to not believe in God.  Yes God can see the future. And yes Jimmy from Idaho killed his wife. BUT GOD DIDN'T KILL HIS WIFE Jimmy did!!! Jimmy made a decision!!! Using his free will. Its not like jimmy doesn't know its bad! Its not like jimmy hasn't been told the law!! Its not like jimmy hasn't tried to hide the evidence because of his bad free will decision!!! No one goes to hell who doesn't deserve to be there. Jimmy isn't predestined to murder. Jimmy is exercising his freewill. Hes breaking the law and he knows it. Jimmy could choose NOT to kill. And by the way, if you read the bible. The only people (if you can call them that) that God sends to hell are in total 3... the Antichrist, the Beast and the false prophet. Everyone else who ends up there is there of their own volition. The false doctrine of a vengeful God who wants you to fry in hell for your sins and throws down fire and brimstone on you is just so wrong. Ever heard the phrase ""Id rather party in hell with my friends than spend eternity in heaven alone"" That's a freewill decision. Sure its ignorance but its still freewill. God would rather you accept the free gift left by his son Jesus at the cross. That's all it takes to not end up in hell. DECIDE (using your freewill) to accept the gift of grace, believe on Him who died and rose again for your sins. Repent of them and know you are a sinner who has been redeemed. The lake of fire (where the unholy 3 spend eternity) was made specifically for them. Not for us. God would much prefer we (his creation) spend eternity with him. That is why he sends people across our path over and over and over again to guide us or persuade  to make the right decisions... There is a passage in the bible that states ""what Satan intended for Evil, God intended for good"" ,,,, Any bad situation, event etc has tangents of good and outcomes of glory to God.  The first use of freewill , Eve tempted by Satan in the garden CHOOSES to believe the lie. Adam tempted by eve to eat the fruit, CHOOSES to eat instead of obeying the one rule of the garden. Free will got us here and Free will, will get us to heaven or take us to hell.",1

But either, pray doesn't work. It works in a different sense.... When you pray, since you believe in it so much, it genuinely helps you. But it's not someone else helping you, it's yourself. It's like praying to change yourself... If you believe enough, your brain starts to change since you genuinely believe it will happen. So you start making those changes and you started saying thank you to god for those changes when you're the one who made them.

You took umbridge with a 'bit' of what i said and ignored the part that justified it after!!¬† Prayer is NOT all in my head. Ive seen it work in my life, ive seen it work in other peoples lives. What about the person, such as yourself, who doesn't believe in it so much? then one day in desperation genuinely calls on the Lord in prayer? Then gets answered?? what do you say to that? Prayer does work. In fact we are told in the bible to pray first for our leaders, for our nation, then for ourselves etc That is all I am saying to do. If you dont like the way something is happening and you cannot do anything physical to stop it then pray!! In fact, if youre able to both pray and do something else then DO BOTH! what is your issue with that?

¬†I can ask God to give me a million dollars. Is that a prayer? Not really, its my greed. What i should pray for is for God's will to prevail in my life. (God will never forsake my own freewill, I am still responsible for my own actions) That is why I pray for His will to prevail.¬† For the leaders of my country, the ones making decisions on my behalf in parliament to be guided by His hand. For those who are influences in my life to have the same guidance. For him to help me in my decision making. For the Holy Spirit to convict me of sin. Its about having faith. Prayer can move mountains. The miracle age is not dead, people just have lost faith. There will come a time in the not to distant future where men will see miraculous and wondrous things manifesting. You obviously don't believe in God or prayer. I get it! Belief is faith in things unseen. Blessed is the one who believes without seeing.",1

This is going to be a lengthy reply, strap yourself in lol ....I know in my inner most being that this is real. The bible gives you several tests you can perform to see if the truth is being spoken. Lets take the test of a true prophet for example. ( prophet here includes mediums fortune tellers, prophets of God, and false prophets) Firstly, by their works you will know them. Matthew 7:15-20 (NKJV)
You Will Know Them by Their Fruits
15¬†‚ÄúBeware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep‚Äôs clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16¬†You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles? 17¬†Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18¬†A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 19¬†Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20¬†Therefore by their fruits you will know them

.Isaiah 8:20 (NKJV)
20¬†To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.
(this word being the Bible/Torah )

Jer. 23:14.¬†""I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness.¬† v.16,¬†Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, [and] not out of the mouth of the LORD.""
True prophets will reprove other prophet's sins, rather than conspire to support one-another's claims

Jer.¬†28:9.¬†""The prophet which prophecies of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, [then] shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.""
True prophet's predictions must come to pass, ALL of them.

So far, up to this date every prophecy that has been spoken in the bible has come to pass. There are more to come and we eagerly await them, but so far the bible has rung true 100% as far as prophecy. Prophecy regarding Israel, Prophecy regarding other countries. Prophecy regarding Isis, Prophecy regarding kings and queens and regimes and empires etc. So far the bible has been 100% accurate.

1 Jn. 4:2.¬†""Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God:""¬† (See also Hebrews 4:15. Jesus ""was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin."")¬†
¬†True prophets confess that Jesus came in our ""fallen"" human flesh, yet He got the victory over every sin and all sin, just as we can, through connection with His Father and our Father.
A false prophet will not acknowledge this. An evil spirit will not acknowledge this.

True prophets exalt Christ alone, but never their own abilities

That is just some points on how to test the prophets. What was my point with this lengthy example? That throughout the world now and in past times, many have come saying this and that about the future and¬† after being tested they have fallen short. Nostradamus for example. I dismiss him straight away, pay him no mind because It is widely known that he used divination and the occult to obtain his visions. And while some of it was accurate he was never 100% accurate. Add to that the vagueness of his writings and much of what hes said is left up to interpretation. A biblical prophet who is of God Gives God all the glory isn't vague, sure he may use symbolization but his meanings are easily identifiable and cypher able. Many many scholars who have studied separately all come to the same conclusion.

Jesus was a real man, He really existed. He is apparent in the history books. He really lived at the time of the Roman Occupation of Israel. He was prophesied to come at that time and he died. Just as the prophecies foretold. The virgin birth the star pointing to his place of birth the timing of his birth it all was significant to the Jewish calandar. Why would someone suffer needlessly just to fulfill a writing in a book? Buddha's bones are still in his grave, Muhammed's bones are still in his grave. I could go on but frankly I don't know all the dead founders of different religions. Jesus however, where are his bones? All those other dead people claimed divine inspiration and claimed to be Gods or Gods messengers on earth yet they are just a pile of bones now! Jesus has no grave. He was laid in a tomb but the tomb was opened and only his burial clothes were there. Not only that but the cloth that was placed around his head was laid out folded!! the rest of the cloth was in a heap. (there is meaning in that, study the history of the Jewish wedding ceremony and it will make sense) Not only that but there were over 500 witnesses of Jesus appearing to people all around Israel after they witnessed his death.

The virgin birth. This was obviously a miraculous supernatural event. No there was no sexual intercourse by God. She was simply supernaturally with child. She needed to remain a virgin for the entire pregnancy and birth so the scriptures (prophecies) would be fulfilled. When a woman is pregnant, none of the mothers blood touches the baby. The placenta acts as a barrier between the mother and the fetus. The Fathers blood is what runs through the baby's veins. So in this sense. the mother being flesh also gives Jesus his Jewish heritage because only the Jews take thier heritage from the mother. The rest of us take our nationality from our fathers. He is Gods son because its Gods blood that runs through His veins. No other prophet or divine messenger of God can claim this. Science backs up this fact.
Science backs up a lot of the bible but that is a whole new lengthy discussion.

There are so many things I could go on about. The evidence is just too numerous that God is real and Jesus is who He claimed to be.

As far as religion goes. I despise religion.!!! Its a man made concept. All one needs is Gods word. You don't need a man wearing a backwards collar flowing robes and a pointy hat to give you his interpretation of Gods Word. The pope claims he is Gods vessel on earth! what a load of crap that is!! God is God.. He can represent Himself!! Anglicans, well there's another load of crap!! Henry the 8th wanted to sleep around so he made up a new religion! ... Buddha sat under a tree for 40 or 49 days, Different versions say different things. Joseph Smith claims to have found golden tablets buried under a rock that founded the Mormon church. Which by the way, is a mirror image of freemasonry. Not surprising when you discover Joseph Smith was a master mason. Muhammad claims to have had divine inspiration for the Quran. Yet each verse describing Allah, is mirrored in the bible with descriptions of Satan. Muhammad wore women's clothing liked young girls and sucked the tongues of young men. All practices he preached punishable (some by death) in his own writings. The Hindus worship many deities. One claims this another claims that ... most Hindus recount a hatred for the never ending cycle of reincarnation. They are constantly trying to attain a better life but never manage to do it.. its fundamentally flawed yet they are trapped within it.¬† There are more that I could discuss, but the main theme running through them is occult practices that my bible says are abominations and should not be done.

Too many atrocities have occurred in the name of religion!! The word religion means to bind up. Jesus came to set us free. So where is the religion in that? I believe that Jesus is the way He is the truth and He is the life. And that no man can come to the Father but through Him.
I might suggest listening to a man named Chuck Missler. Just type his name into your YouTube search bar. He is a biblical scholar. He has a linguist, a very learned man. He, as have other people, discovered a theme running through the bible that can only lead to one conclusion. That it is in fact the divine word of God. I will give you a link http://www.khouse.org/articles/1996/44/

I hope this novel LOL has been helpful in answering you. I know I have waffled on a bit. Im not the most articulate person but I do believe the bible to be the word of God. I sincerely pray you find your way to Him. :)",0

Nobody is the same person they were a year ago.

2. Donald Trump is a frightening result of things like talk radio fear mongering that fosters a very dangerous radicalism against notions driven more by that fear than by informed reason. 

Videos like this are typical desperate propaganda to attempt to contradict the blatant bully attitude that everyone has seen from trump more and more over the years but that not everyone wants to admit is concerning for all the most obvious reasons.",1,true,9,,,,,,

Obamacare or Romneycare whatever you want to call it is new. of Course he takes a NEW STANCE on that. Nafta TPP TPA all are trade treaties that crush trade. So pretty much Donald is the same. The muslim Terrorism started in 1979 when the first organizations in the middle east began the extreme islamic beliefs. So Thats a newer one Trump has to take on as it wasnt as big of a threat until 9/11 and the Operation Iraqi Freedom.

As the democratic ideas would completely crush the country. For example, China, now 11th in rank of quality in education. While US dropped to 20th. China is cheaper, quickly growing economy and quality of production getting better and better. Advantage of the West always was that we could compete in terms of quality, now that will become a massive problem over the comming years. So democrates are all about equal pay, raise of minimum wage, increase of taxes etc. etc. All things that will increase production costs when the prices of products are higher then elsewhere already. So you price yourself out of the international markets. So what do multinationals do? For long periods of time already they compensate, to limit the expenses, by higherling illegals. As illegals arent required to pay minimum wage, as lets face it, what they gonna do about it? They dont wanna be deported. So when minimum wage goes up, illegals problems will only get worse as 99% of things is decided in congress and multinationals will lobby enough to vote against whatever would have them be able to employ illegals without them being send back or the flow through of illegals to the US to stop. A huge wall at border would probably work, but that isnt what the multinationals want and 1 man, even when president, cant make it happen.  About terrorists is alot more complex btw, started between 1914-1918, look up the Sykes-Picot treaty. Thats the foundation of hate from the MIddle East towards the west, what is now Israel was promised to Arabs in a treaty by france, UK etc. as they were desperate for help against the Ottomans and the Germans. After the deal was made the Arabs helped them win the war, to find out that France and the Brits made a new agreement set up together with Rothschild that would make the area become what now is Israel. Wasnt put into action after 1948, but fact is, Arabs hate the West because the one time they trusted us and sacraficed many many lifes, they got screwed over. And then us helping dictators in place of their countries that did horrible things to the people didnt help either, as Saddam, Khadaffi and alot more people we know now as horrible dictators were sponsored with weapons and finances to take power of their country. In that sense Trump wanting to close borders isnt a bad idea as im 100% certain that even tho people enter in hope of a better life, some do with a grudge against the West.

Its not about individual nihilism, its about building a culture that rejects morality and ethics entirely. They merely have to find the same degree of discomfort, even within being a billionaire, that we do as slaves. We don't have to kill them actually, we just have to make their experience as toxic for them as it is for us so that they realize the damage they are doing. Push comes to shove, 300 million people descend upon them- they cannot kill us all. The change we will see comes from making them surrender by changing the minds of the people as a whole. It begins with a resistance to indoctrination through the media and religion. We suffer for our distractions and fascination with meaningless things. I and many are others are beginning to realize that politics is a giant theater. Its just a meaningless puppet show with no demonstrable effect on our lives. Its only there to satiate the minds of slaves who desire their voices being heard.

You don't get it. The political system is a farce- its not real. You may as well vote for Ronald Mcdonald because we can be sure that he is going to have more power than any president. Its always been like this, the priesthood reigns- not the king. A perfectly transparent system is absolutely necessary but our vision gets darker and cloudier everyday. Why? Because they are hiding the fact we are slaves simply being pushed into work for longer hours and less pay every year. Since the 80's its gotten worse only and no amount of voting has changed this fact. One need only examine inflation to minimum wage stats, wealth disparity and the rate of change for net worth by percentage for top earners vs. the rest of us. The game is rigged. Voting is nothing. They simply use politicians to lie and create the illusion of society. Its nothing but a plantation and if cattle had a voice do you really think the farmers would care what they say? No. If they make any concessions at all it is only because they see it will sedate the minds of the slaves further if they acquiesce in turn quenching the blood-lust for revolution. By supporting the voting system that merely dumps your voice into a garbage bin you agree to the terms of citizenry which translates directly to slave in the modern era. We have to reject it wholly if we want to be heard.",4

Also many Muslims are now coming to Christ as they realize their God is ha shatan (satan) the deceiver , the Quran even calls allah the great deceiver .

Let me guarantee something for you :-)
You will believe in God and Jesus and you will bow to him and acknowledge him as Lord .

That was Herod btw and the Romans were masters at editing their own history , only things that made them look good were allowed  ,not everything was recorded anyway . 

Everyone was writing toward a target audience and what is important to one audience is not important to another. Yet all agree that Herod was a paranoid, loony murderer -- especially in his old age.

btw there is more evidence that Jesus lived than Julius Caesar much more yet i assume you believe he lived ?

Im certainly not going to go back and forth with some Atheist , because you believe all this complexity just happened to pop out of thin air , so any dialogue is pointless on deeper things , period .

But the proof you so desire is just around the corner , there will be NO Atheists or Agnostics .
Jesus IS God , became a man , died for YOUR sins so you (IF) you accept him WILL live forever . This existence is swiftly going to end , your life will end then you will stand before God .

Dont bother arguing with me over it , that is your dilemma not mine . There is a God he told how this would end  .",0

That's completely wrong and the article doesn't suggest anything remotely similar, this wasn't over people that Trump didn't hire. What happened was after numerous people of color made complaints about Trumps business discriminating against them by not renting to them, The Justice Department sent in undercover officials and found that the claims were true, the black officials were told the apartments weren't available and then the white officials were told that they were available. Trumps employees that were in charge of the applications were marking them with the letter 'C' for colored so that they know not to rent to those people, the employees went on record to say that they were told do it by their superiors.",1

The media is playing you like the fool you are allowing yourself to be.  He never said such a thing.  It was nothing to do with race and everything to do with the judge's beliefs, something which Trump made very clear.  However, the media spun it with their normal brand of quick cuts taken out of context and pieced together to make Trump sound racist.  Don't be played for a fool and look into things yourself instead of filtered through mainstream media lies.

Identity politics is a recipe for disaster. The Muslim extremists are dangerous. But not as dangerous as Rumsfeld and Cheney who gambled millions of lives for an extra dollar. How many American's have those terrors ts killed? A few million? Why are they walking around as free men?

""socialist"" has an infinite number of definitions. What you're doing is repeating right-wing propaganda.

In Norway arms regulations are rather strict, but freedom of speech is alive, the vote is here, public transportation is doing good, but there's by no means too much of it. I'm not sure if it's 100% public or partially privatized.

Has Bernie taken a public anti-gun stance? In that case I understand your concern. I think it makes sense to have guns in the USA, largely because it's such a huge country with long distances between population centers perhaps.

During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990. After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father. You know, you have to be pretty bright to be accepted in Harvard. It was not his race that got him where he is today, on the contrary, it was his character, smarts and his charisma that did it. So, you think Trump and his nonsensical, hateful rants is the man for the job? Members of his own Republican party are shocked & horrified that they let this guy become a candidate. Some are bowing out because they just can't bring themselves to vote for him. It's embarrassing. Other countries are scratching their heads in collective disbelief that someone is actually voting for this cartoon character.  Another thing: ""Liberty Above All Else"" for who? Only whites? Excepting indigenous people, EVERYONE came to this country for a better life - including your ancestors and ALL of us make up America. ""...one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for ALL."" So, who are Americans? We're every race, color, creed - we're ALL OF THAT and we need to start acting like it.",1

Here is the correct source:
The Goals Of Donald J. Trump‚Äôs Tax Plan
Too few Americans are working, too many jobs have been shipped overseas, and too many middle class families cannot make ends meet. This tax plan directly meets these challenges with four simple goals:
Tax relief for middle class Americans: In order to achieve the American dream, let people keep more money in their pockets and increase after-tax wages.
Simplify the tax code to reduce the headaches Americans face in preparing their taxes and let everyone keep more of their money.
Grow the American economy by discouraging corporate inversions, adding a huge number of new jobs, and making America globally competitive again.
Doesn‚Äôt add to our debt and deficit, which are already too large.
The Trump Tax Plan Achieves These Goals
If you are single and earn less than $25,000, or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you will not owe any income tax. That removes nearly 75 million households ‚Äì over 50% ‚Äì from the income tax rolls. They get a new one page form to send the IRS saying, ‚ÄúI win,‚Äù those who would otherwise owe income taxes will save an average of nearly $1,000 each.
All other Americans will get a simpler tax code with four brackets ‚Äì 0%, 10%, 20% and 25% ‚Äì instead of the current seven. This new tax code eliminates the marriage penalty and the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) while providing the lowest tax rate since before World War II.
No business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. This lower rate makes corporate inversions unnecessary by making America‚Äôs tax rate one of the best in the world.
No family will have to pay the death tax. You earned and saved that money for your family, not the government. You paid taxes on it when you earned it.
The Trump Tax Plan Is Revenue Neutral
The Trump tax cuts are fully paid for by:
Reducing or eliminating most deductions and loopholes available to the very rich.
A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted 10% tax rate, followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.
Reducing or eliminating corporate loopholes that cater to special interests, as well as deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on corporations and business income. We will also phase in a reasonable cap on the deductibility of business interest expenses.
DETAILS OF DONALD J. TRUMP‚ÄôS TAX PLAN
America needs a bold, simple and achievable plan based on conservative economic principles. This plan does that with needed tax relief for all Americans, especially the working poor and middle class, pro-growth tax reform for all sizes of businesses, and fiscally responsible steps to ensure this plan does not add to our enormous debt and deficit.
This plan simplifies the tax code by taking nearly 50% of current filers off the income tax rolls entirely and reducing the number of tax brackets from seven to four for everyone else. This plan also reduces or eliminates loopholes used by the very rich and special interests made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rates on individuals and companies.",0

Don't make up false info about Trump's healthcare. Here it is:
Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act‚ÄîObamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don‚Äôt work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry.
But none of these positive reforms can be accomplished without Obamacare repeal. On day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.
However, it is not enough to simply repeal this terrible legislation. We will work with Congress to make sure we have a series of reforms ready for implementation that follow free market principles and that will restore economic freedom and certainty to everyone in this country. By following free market principles and working together to create sound public policy that will broaden healthcare access, make healthcare more affordable and improve the quality of the care available to all Americans.
Any reform effort must begin with Congress. Since Obamacare became law, conservative Republicans have been offering reforms that can be delivered individually or as part of more comprehensive reform efforts. In the remaining sections of this policy paper, several reforms will be offered that should be considered by Congress so that on the first day of the Trump Administration, we can start the process of restoring faith in government and economic liberty to the people.
Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must:
Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.
Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up.
Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn‚Äôt Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.
Allow individuals to use Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Contributions into HSAs should be tax-free and should be allowed to accumulate. These accounts would become part of the estate of the individual and could be passed on to heirs without fear of any death penalty. These plans should be particularly attractive to young people who are healthy and can afford high-deductible insurance plans. These funds can be used by any member of a family without penalty. The flexibility and security provided by HSAs will be of great benefit to all who participate.
Require price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and healthcare organizations like clinics and hospitals. Individuals should be able to shop to find the best prices for procedures, exams or any other medical-related procedure.
Block-grant Medicaid to the states. Nearly every state already offers benefits beyond what is required in the current Medicaid structure. The state governments know their people best and can manage the administration of Medicaid far better without federal overhead. States will have the incentives to seek out and eliminate fraud, waste and abuse to preserve our precious resources.
Remove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products. Congress will need the courage to step away from the special interests and do what is right for America. Though the pharmaceutical industry is in the private sector, drug companies provide a public service. Allowing consumers access to imported, safe and dependable drugs from overseas will bring more options to consumers.
The reforms outlined above will lower healthcare costs for all Americans. They are simply a place to start. There are other reforms that might be considered if they serve to lower costs, remove uncertainty and provide financial security for all Americans. And we must also take actions in other policy areas to lower healthcare costs and burdens. Enforcing immigration laws, eliminating fraud and waste and energizing our economy will relieve the economic pressures felt by every American. It is the moral responsibility of a nation‚Äôs government to do what is best for the people and what is in the interest of securing the future of the nation.
Providing healthcare to illegal immigrants costs us some $11 billion annually. If we were to simply enforce the current immigration laws and restrict the unbridled granting of visas to this country, we could relieve healthcare cost pressures on state and local governments.
To reduce the number of individuals needing access to programs like Medicaid and Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program we will need to install programs that grow the economy and bring capital and jobs back to America. The best social program has always been a job ‚Äì and taking care of our economy will go a long way towards reducing our dependence on public health programs.
Finally, we need to reform our mental health programs and institutions in this country. Families, without the ability to get the information needed to help those who are ailing, are too often not given the tools to help their loved ones. There are promising reforms being developed in Congress that should receive bi-partisan support.
To reform healthcare in America, we need a President who has the leadership skills, will and courage to engage the American people and convince Congress to do what is best for the country. These straightforward reforms, along with many others I have proposed throughout my campaign, will ensure that together we will Make America Great Again.",0

It is not more than the difference between murder and suicide. - Ayn Rand

In a nation where all property/labor is owned by the government it is impossible for the common person to feel secure. Individuals eventually recognize that they are serfs of the state & since they are subject to the whims of the politburo of the day, have no real possibility for self determination. The only way to pull yourself out of the mire, is to attempt too become one of a handful of Party authorities, who are the few able to live in the luxury of the top capitalists they criticize.
¬†¬†
Socialism is a failure because it suppresses the human spirit. Why else have so many thousands of people lost their lives in attempts to clandestinely escape their socialistic bondage & reach nations which embrace free market economies? In comparison, how many people have willingly left free market economies to move to socialist countries? Centrally planned economies deprive the human spirit of its collective hope, by slowly eliminating all; ownership (property - labor), ambition (incentive), security, & individual liberties (eventually raising a wall to keep the workers inside from escaping their serfdom).

Socialism is incompatible with the most basic principles of nature. Just as animals are trained to perform a particular behavior through positive reinforcement, humans generally WILL NOT PERFORM an act of labor unless they can actually achieve an acceptable reward & truly own it. A free market economy provides the infrastructure for more competition, which fuels the socio-economic engine. While socialism=No true ownership=No Competition=No incentive=No dedication=No innovation=No Economy.

Socialists always have a common goal for ""the little people"", to perish in the revolutionary holocaust!

The strength of capitalism can be attributed to an incentive structure based upon the three P's: (1) prices determined by market forces, (2) a profit-and-loss system of accounting and (3) private property rights. The failure of socialism can be traced to its neglect of these three incentive-enhancing components.",0

‚ÄúIn a capitalist society, the people make those decisions. The businesses, the market decides how much products will cost, how many there are, where it will be made.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the socialist system, there's a mix of both. The government operates the system to help all, but there is opportunity for private property and private wealth. That's generally how we talk about it.‚Äù  A socialist government could control all of the means of production ‚Äî or it could, for example, use taxes to redistribute resources among the population.

the United States is not a purely capitalist society. There are and have long been socialist aspects to how the government makes decisions and applies its power, while still striving to keep the marketplace as free as possible. And, of course, while allowing democratic decisions to guide what it does.

The example of the United States serves as a reminder that these ideas exist on a three-dimensional scale, in which differentiation is often tricky.

‚Äúall of these terms are 'umbrella concepts'; in other words, they are host to a family of related ideas, not all of them compatible with one another.‚Äù We tend to use the terms concretely, which necessarily introduces inaccuracies, ‚Äúthey [can] serve as excuses not to think, as belief systems that discourage explorations of the mismatch between theory and practice and the inconsistencies of any grand theory.‚Äù

Communism ‚Äúwas the endpoint of Marx's ideas,‚Äù though Marx didn't delineate what it would look like, exactly. ‚ÄúWe find hints in works like 'The German Ideology‚Äù (1846) where there is a description of working life that is unalienated, i.e. creative and various ‚Äî we hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, and become opera critics in the evening.‚Äú During the Cold War, though, the idea came to be inextricably and pejoratively associated with the Soviet Union and with the elimination of private property. The term, in Quill's words, ‚Äùserved as a shorthand for all things un-American‚Äú ‚Äî which was the way that Trump used it.

Socialism was in part a response to capitalism, largely through the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Socialism focuses on the inequalities that arise within capitalism through a number of possible responses. : ‚Äú[T]he state might 'wither away' or collapse altogether, in others it would regulate the production of goods and services, in yet others it would become thoroughly democratic‚Äù ‚Äî all with the aim of reducing that inequality.

You can see that's where democratic socialism arises. That philosophy seeks ‚Äúdemocratic control of sectors of society and economy in order to avoid the pitfalls of an unregulated market and the kind of terrible authoritarian government that emerged in the Soviet Union.‚Äù",0

After Nazi Germany terminated the 1939 Nazi-Soviet Pact by invading its Soviet Union partner, the two military titans engaged in bitter war of epic proportions.¬† Like a jilted lover, communists not only went after Nazi Germany with vengeance on the battlefield, but cranked up their propaganda machine to identify anyone opposed to communism as ‚Äúfascist.‚Äù This is a curious anomaly given that the German National Socialists had masterminded the initial military strikes against the Soviet Union, not Mussolini‚Äôs Fascist Italy.

This is an historical oddity, because Benito Mussolini had warm relations with the Soviet Union and Lenin. Mussolini wasn‚Äôt a monarchist, capitalist or a rightwing churchgoer. He was fervently anticlerical, an avowed atheist and a well-known Marxist during the early years of his life. Where‚Äôs the proof?¬† In 1924 Fascist Italy became the first western country to recognize the Soviet Union. That should not be surprising. Calling himself the ‚ÄúLenin of Italy,‚Äù Mussolini had earlier launched a theoretical Marxist journal, Utopia. Two of his collaborators on Utopia went on to found the Italian Communist Party. Another helped found the German Communist Party. As socialist and labor agitator, he led strikes and riots against Italy‚Äôs invasion of Ottoman Libya in the 1911‚Äì1912. He supported the violent labor strikes during ‚ÄúRed Week, until it failed to topple the government.¬† During the 1920s and 1930s, he often boasted that fascism was the same as communism.

But how did fascism become anchored to Marxism? Historically, fascism arose in the 1890s out of a crisis in Marxist theory which was making Marxism archaic, obsolete and irrelevant. One of its major crises dealt with class conflict. The problem was, few workers were interested in class struggle. Instead, the populace was drawn to the flags of nationalism, especially with the unification of Italy in 1861 and of Germany in 1871. In an attempt to save Marxism, a number of notable Marxist intellectuals attempted to replace class struggle with revolutionary nationalism. In a well-documented article, ‚ÄúThe Mysteries of Fascism,‚Äù David Ramsay Steele explained: ‚ÄúFascism began as a revision of Marxism by Marxists‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSocialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain."" - Frederic Batsiat",1

BEGINNINGS OF SOCIALISM
In 1817, socialism was first named by Henri de Saint-Simon in his treatise L‚ÄôIndustrie. He admired the works of the economist of capitalism Adam Smith. The socialism of Henri de Saint-Simon is often referred as utopian socialism. This first type of socialism doesn‚Äôt need the mandate and control of the government to be implemented. The societies created by Robert Owens were used as models of utopian socialism. But they still require strict adherence to the virtues of Christendom.
¬†
In 1848, the political pamphlet ‚ÄúCommunist Manifesto‚Äù of the Germans Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels was published. Communism is the atheistic socialism way of life. Liberals and radical politicians adhere to it and started revolutions throughout Europe. They topple and killed down politicians, leaders, monarchs, elites, oligarchs, etc. of Europe that don‚Äôt adhere to the communist principles.
¬†
Also in 1848 John Mill Stuart published the textbook ‚ÄúPrinciples of Political Economy‚Äù. He criticized socialism and communism as alternatives to capitalism.
¬†
In 1859, John Mill Stuart‚Äôs book ‚ÄúOn Liberty‚Äù was published. Liberal economic socialism was introduced. He advocated the freedom of speech.",2

There is no such thing as religion, one can only be religious in their personal beliefs.  I personally am not tied to any religion but I do what I believe is right religiously because it was the way I was raised by my religious parents who in fact are not tied to any religion.  There is right, and there is wrong.  Good and bad. You do not need religion to be or follow your heart and beliefs religiously. In a more biblical sense, Jesus didn't preach religion, instead he preached of a religious life in a ""god's"" name. We all have a choice except those that are born soulless in respect to the term evil.  Religion doesn't exist, it's a made up word to distract from living a truly free religious life in any, or a  god's name.  Make a decision and live by it religiously.  You'll find out soon enough if you are right or wrong.  All anyone has to do is decide.",1

Rather than decreasing poverty which is what should have happened, it has done nothing but increase. Poverty goes up, the spending on social security goes up, and that's how it's been ever since it's been implemented.

The way to phase it out would be to have everyone who is currently receiving benefits still gets those benefits. We do not give any more benefits, and eventually abolish government social security/welfare. One or more private social security/welfare institutions can come into being, operating solely on donations. Donations would (most likely) give them less money to work with, which would require those private institutions to make the selection process and the continuation process to receive welfare more scrutinizing, and the people who really need it would receive it while people like those currently taking advantage of the system would not. Private institutions would also be more apt to (and less criticized for) implementing incentives to actually get up and participate in the workforce.

All in all, it would be a very win-heavy situation. People who want to donate would still donate, and they would get to feel better about it as they would be making the contributions personally. People who don't will be able to keep their money. The government's guns won't be pointed at either of these parties, or digging in their wallets. And for once, we'd actually have a chance at chipping away at poverty through the various incentive and requirement programs that could be implemented by these private welfare institutions.",4

Current affairs were not dumbed down as they expected you to understand the conversation not just talking points and short attention spans for news stories of 1 minute or less. The conversation was much smarter. 

Computers were only for smart people who needed them not a population that relied on them. Computers were not taking our jobs as a labour force is more useful and cannot be hacked into and helps the gdp greater than some big multinationals who dedicate their lives to tax avoidance. 

Afterall pen and paper is more of a legal document than some computer linked server in a cloud that could be taken down by a hacker at the click of a mouse.

Pen and Paper has more security than a Chinese made smartphone- smirk. Maybe thats why Mr Putins ministry of the interior has gone back to typewriters too- as overreliance on computers becomes a burden.",0
