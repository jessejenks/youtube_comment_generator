His prioritization of combating extremist Islamic terrorism will benefit far more than just America. A glance across the Atlantic Ocean is proof of the urgency of this matter. His statement on crime in Sweden and Germany wasn't just to prove a point, but because he - like many of us - want to see this issue fixed instead of having wool pulled over our eyes.

Schön dass es unser Held geschafft hat! Ich hoffe er sägt die FED ab. Einfach ist die Entkopplung bestimmt nicht, aber da gab es ja schon mal einen der es fast geschafft hatte. Oh Leute! Beschützt den Mann gut! 

In Deutschland vertrauen noch enorm viele Menschen den großen Medien... Aber es gibt einige die sehr aktiv sind! Das Zauberwort ""Verfassungstheoretiker"" soll uns als Spinner degradieren. Aber das zieht schon bei sehr vielen nicht mehr. Auf NTV 24 laufen ununterbrochen amerikanische Propaganda ""Dokumentationen"". Die noch ein Großteil des Volkes vom denken ablösen. Ewige Schuld, und Aliens sollen wohl wahrscheinlicher sein, als dass 911 ein Insiderjob war....     Ganz so schlimm wie es manchmal bei euch dargestellt wird ist es  nicht überall.

Alex, bitte starte mal ein Weckruf an die Deutschen. Euer President hat es ja schon angedeutet. Aber wer hier davon spricht, dass wir keine Verfassung haben wird sofort in die rechte Ecke geschoben. Dabei brauchen wir dringend eine Verfassung, die uns ermöglicht die Macht vom Volke aus kommen zu lassen. Statistiken werden gefälscht, Petitionen nicht angenommen, Demostationen von bezahlten Schauspielern sabotiert... . Viele Deutsche hassen eure vorige Regierung, aber nicht das amerikanische Volk. Ich sag nur Ramstein, NATO Zwang( wird uns zumindest so suggeriert), und natürlich die übermächtigen Konzerne die mit TTIP das gesamte Weltgefüge durcheinander gebracht hätten.

Obama hat ja geredet wie ein Engel. Das ""Obama Care"" so ein Desaster war, hat hier fast keiner gewusst. Was wohl bekannt war ist das Ding mit dem Flugverbot, und der erweiterten Überwachung. Die FEMA Camps sind hier immer noch ein Rätzel, wenn da überhaut einer von Wind bekommen hat. Von Chemtrails und HARRAP, oder nur von der Aluminiumbelastung der Gewässer und des Bodens wollen wir mal gar nicht anfangen... . Da kann der Himmel voll sein, und es wundert keinen.

Möge der wahre Gott Amerika schützen!!!

Why not then just shut down the criminal justice and let all criminals go, for the sake of a reconciliation between the law abiding and the lawless.

The Isamic agenda is exactly the same one they have been using for 1400 years

ALWAYS arriving in targeted peaceful countries - pretending they are a persecuted people sarcastically called ''peaceful religion'' and the outcome is exactly the same every-time.

nice people when receiving handouts and hospitality but WHEN IN MAJORITY
Islam turns on the hosts and savagely kills them...Armenia is a good example - they turned on the wealthy Armenian hosts and crucified their teenage daughters naked...the evil of Islam knows no boundaries. Islam has the worse genocide record ever recorded in history ...committed by Muslims.[led by who?]

Islam is racist and ignorant and refuse to abide by nonMuslim laws,  its about time crime is called what it is ''CRIME'' and not called religion.

If nonMuslims refuse to heed history then history will repeat itself. Muslims and their racist god and racist ideology of hate does not belong in the west.

It should be banned like the KKK and Nazism

Welcome...and the problem is not refugee's.

The problem is the Muslims who throw tantrums and blow people up - or ramble on about their arabic racist sand god.. It is not permitted to come into the west hating the Jews or hating nonMuslims ways/culture.

Whoever refuses/cannot integrate with normal people [westerners who want to live quiet lives] should be forcefully removed along with their  relatives back to the dirty hovels they were rescued from.

The west are sick of the backward behaviour, tantrums and obsession about raping little girls/boys or attacking unarmed women/killing reporters/film makers/media /authors.

z12qvxqbvly2ttcer22xyde42yyhvjxyx04,oYeb 77,6 months ago,1478562040019,"The illuminati agenda 
is a multigenerational agenda over thousands of years and it’s sophistication surpasses both human intelligence and nature/capabilities. Globalists are actually Aliens/Demons/Djinns/Interdimensional Entities (same entities that go under various names) and pose as humans. Weather they dimensionally project themselves into 3D being 4D entities themselves or possess/bodysnatch 3D human bio-suits, or them being 3D polymorphs. Them and humans cooperating with them in exchange for promises of power, survival and life extension selling out Humanity in return. It seems that we are dealing with different phenomenon and entities: 1. ""Body-snatching"" of former real people/housing for that purpose bred clones/bio-suits, vessles to access the 3D realm (alien mind parasite, 4th dimensional entity attachement/hosting) 2. Non-physical 4D alien projectors (Steve-O shapeshifting) 3. Physical polymorphic aliens (Species 8472 Star Trek, Aliens in ""The Arrival"") 4. Physical aliens using hologram technology. (Anonymous Rex) It's a possibility that they murder the real person at some point with the switch-over going unnoticed due to their extremely well developed abilities to immitate and act as impostors, or they were aliens from the beginning.

Hydra/Illuminati/The “Globalists”/Brotherhood of the Snake/Spectre/Cobra/The Crazy 88/The “Elite” Different names for the same organization, that basically are alien special forces. Negative Alien collectives are struggling over finite resources hence efficiency needs to be maximized. The horse head nebula in Orion was discovered (that's where they come from) by Williamina Fleming (An anagram for Ian Fleming the author of James Bond), Jack the Ripper murdered in 1888, Monster Blizzards, Sasha Grey (alien) was born 1988, Conchita Wurst (Baphomet) was born 1988, the CERN collider has 88 in it's logo, the ebola virus was depicted as 88 strand, the illuminati were officially founded 1776 - that's 2x888, the secret doctrine was channeled to Helena Blavatsky 1888, the all-seeing one eyed Kodak camera was invented in 1888, 88=HH=Hail Hitler, THEY LIVE and Alien Nation were released in 1988, and on and on. Hence the “Crazy 88” (as mentioned in the movie “Kill Bill”). 

Where is the proof/evidence for aliens among us? 
Anyone with common sense acknowledges this possibility, anyone with an open mind will research the subject, and anyone with open eyes who does the research will confirm for themselves that aliens exist, have been active in our past, and continue to be actively involved in human affairs today. Skeptics tend to be ignorant and refuse to examine all the evidence, closing their eyes and claiming they don’t see any evidence that aliens exist. The Fermi Paradox, or “if aliens exist then why aren’t they here” is like a blind man asking “if the sun exists, then why don’t I burst into flames when I step outside.” False assumptions and lack of perception stemming from lack of proper investigation. In truth, ignorance is never proof to the contrary, and seeming nonexistence of evidence isn’t evidence of nonexistence. There is evidence for the alien presence and involvement in human affairs that are of a materialistic nature, perceivable by the 5 senses. If you don't 'see' them it's because you choose so, not because they wouldn't exist. ""Evidence is everywhere – from worldwide accounts commonly describing ancient encounters with advanced beings, anomalous archaeological sites and artifacts indicating past use of superior technology, over a century’s worth of eyewitness sightings of UFOs, hundreds of physical trace samples recovered from UFO landing sites, government documents and whistleblowers acknowledging the existence of extraterrestrials, and thousands of abduction cases that include multiple witnesses, memories recalled without hypnosis, and indisputable physical and medical evidence confirming these accounts."" And in modern days we have technology which allows for sophisticated video analysis at hand that reveal unexplainable anomalies within the scientific dogma of our time. Have you watched the latest shapeshifting video of Miley Cyrus with her irides turning into thin slits? Same with Britney Spears. Two recent very distinct shapeshifting anomalies. People who dismiss them do so because their world view doesn't allow for acceptance so they just claim it's fake because it must be. But it's hopeless, they can't be explained away with video anomaly. It's just simply two shapeshifting entities disguisng in human form. 
Who are their loyalties with? 
They are not like us and they don’t like us. They are not your friends, they are not your lovers, they are not family. They are not loyal to you, but only to their alien father race. They are genetically related to the aliens. They have this dr jekyll and mr hyde thing going on transforming from reasonable, calm, to extremely vicious, devious, cunning, hurtful, selfish, obnoxious within literally seconds. They can’t be trusted. They cannot be argumentatively converted, they lack emotional comprehension, and they have a very strong imbedded sense of superiority over humans. They are just what they are. Remember the fable of the frog and scorpion with the frog foolishly transporting the scorpion over the river on his back and the scorpion stinging the frog half way, killing the frog and causing them both to drown, because it’s in the scorpions nature. The scorpion can’t help it, and neither can they. 
 
Creating/Influencing Reality: 
Consciousness influences reality by affecting the probability of events. It does so at the quantum level known as the 'observer effect' in quantum physics . The basic principles are as follows: 
1) Awareness / anticipation repels. 
2) Ignorance / denial allows. 
3) Intent / emotional resonance attracts. 
LIKE BEGETS LIKE. In other words, the mental and emotional state that you hold in the present, attracts future events that engender more of the same. Emotions can travel through time. A strong emotional pattern in the present resonates with the same emotional pattern in some probable future. When both match, a feedback loop arises between present and future that causes this future to be energized and amplified, enhancing its ability to merge into the present. New Agers go very wrong when they try to ignore currently existing problems and think that by shutting it from their minds it will disappear from their reality.

Planetary Karma Warfare:
Abortion is a cornerstone in the spiritual war against humanity. All the major promoters of abortion are reptilian hybrids. And most if not all of the abortion clinics are led by them as well. Where they consume the aborted fetuses. And who knows how many end up in the human food supply. If we kill ourselves, and that includes the unborn apparently, this gives the reptilians the metaphysical right to literally abort us. If you don't value the life of the most innocent you're not worth of having your own. And expansion of this agenda is it to kill infants up to age 4, which will create even more negative karma even faster. This is the law of planetary karma, and the reptilians use it against us in order to annihilate us and take over our planet. They can't force us, but they can manipulate us into doing it. Quiet successfully so, sadly.

Eating animals is another cornerstone of reptilian karma warfare as well as the war on human consciousness. If we exploit life forms with lesser cognitive abilities, they are metaphysically allowed to exploit us as they have higher cognitive abilities. Also the consumption of meat lowers the consumer and keeps him in a state of a very low level of consciousness. Injecting all the agony, fear, terror the animal felt before its death is what becomes part of the consumer. Globalism includes a variety of political and ideological concepts. It's an umbrella term for every ideology the reptilians used since millenia to socially engineer the worlds civilization into a global technoratic tyranny, also known as New World Order. Everything that connects us with what is of divine origin strengthens spirit and weakens evil. The reptilians overwrite true divine reality with an artificial synthetic reality. They do not want us to connect with nature, they don't want us to communicate, they don't want us to go inside ourselves. They want us dim, docile, unable to articulate properly, unconscious, passive and weak and completely domesticated on their quest to create the perfect human slave. Misandry and misogyny, radical feminism, racism, class war, culture war, tribalism, disrespecting the old, abusing the young, disrespecting soldiers (they thought they were doing good), pedophilia, beastiality, torture, immorality, these are all concepts foreign to true human nature and were introduced by the reptilian social engineers in order to divide&conquer us, to weaken our spirit and diminish our life force and will to survive. All this and much more are elements of the strategic global warfare several inter-dimensional alien collectives are responsible for.

How to comprehend it all: 
“That’s CRAZY!”, “That’s all just fiction!”, “It makes my head hurt!”, “This is just too big!”. “It seems to make sense, but I’m not sure”. The human brain in it’s momentary artifically downgraded state was designed (corrupted) in order to not comprehend it all. That was the point of the downgrade (via the Saturn-moon matrix hack of our DNA which turned us into biological robots merely conscious). But we can overcome the hack/downgrade/surpression by intention and expand our awareness/intelligence in order to eventually easily comprehend it all. We are spirit operating artificially downgraded (originally 12 DNA strand) 2 strand DNA organic bio-suits and by intent are able to reupgrade it to 12 strands.",0,true,2,,,,,,

We had a problem at work that required an all nighter from the employees, but we ended up getting it fixed sooner than expected. I opened the door to our apartment and heard moaning from our bedroom. I immediately knew what had happened. It was that fuckin co-worker of Jennifer's. That goddamn bee. 
I burst into the bedroom, almost crying because of how much I loved her. I couldn't let it end like this. On some deeper level, I must have known that I wouldn't be good enough for her. There she was, the love of my life, in bed with that fuckin bee. She had been sucking him off when I came in, his 2 mm. erection throbbing insider her mouth. He was better than me in every way. 
I ran up to that fucker and grabbed him by his wing then started flicking him. He was too much though, better than me not just sexually, but physically. He used his strength, strength you would expect not from a bee but an ant, and threw me against the wall and then started beating the shit out of me. Jennifer pulled him off of me and walked out with him. I laid there on the floor and cried myself to sleep.
The next morning I woke up and found a note of the pillow of our bed, as well as a few spots of bee cum scattered across the mattress. The note read, ""I'm sorry baby, I didn't want you to find out this way. I can't resist my new honey though. I'll come get my stuff in two days.""
You may think that now Allison. But trust me. Once you see that superb bee cock, your thoughts will change immediately. The mere sight of the one I saw deep inside the love of my life almost turned me gay just looking at it.",31

Carefully and delicately steer the conversation in the direction and wait until the other guy says something where you now can give an off the index card response that actually makes you sound cool. Then get in and out FAST. Don't linger. Dont argue. Just one quick jab and then laugh it off and move on. No one likes a preacher and no one likes an ideologue.

Do you even know what is going on in the world? Hillary/Barack are provoking World war 3, Obama is trying to turn us into a 3rd world country. Bernie is a COMMUNIST, HISTORY PROVES IT DOES NOT WORK. Pay attention, please. Trump is the only one that can help, Just pay attention do your own research and it will be obvious that Trump is the only real answer.
!!!TIPS!!!
1. If the news tells you ""2+2=500"" DO NOT BELIEVE IT, please, do your own research, it is so obvious that 2+2=4 so just please have some common sense. 
2. If Hillary/Barack tell you something, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do your own research, DO NOT TAKE THEIR WORD FOR IT. They are known for lying, Everything Hillary has said so far in her campaign has ALL BEEN LIES. Obama on Obamacare, A LIE. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH! BE YOUR OWN PERSON! DON'T JUST BELIEVE EVERYTHING SOMEONE SAYS ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS NOT PROOF!
3. Remember, not everything is BLACK and WHITE, Everything Barack and Hillary have done, have pushed America to the ground, we are DYING. THIS IS SERIOUS, THIS IS NOT A JOKE! THERE IS MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE.
4. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, BBC, and MORE are all about Clinton, bought by Clinton, Managed, Serviced News By Clinton, Clinton News Network. USE REAL news networks, OR at least do your own RESEARCH after watching CNN, MSNBC, ABC, BBC and MORE. These networks are KNOWN to be BIASED, are KNOWN to LIE, are KNOWN to produce FAKE news! New york Times, Huffington post, These are all ridiculous news sources. 
5. DON'T JUST TAKE ANYONE'S WORD FOR IT, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, YOU HAVE A BRAIN! USE IT! IT IS NOT A DIFFICULT TASK. WE LIVE IN THE ERA OF KNOWLEDGE, JUST ABOUT EVERYONE IN AMERICA HAS ACCESS TO INFORMATION! ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO OUT AND GET IT! DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!
AGAIN, DON'T JUST TAKE ANYONE'S WORD FOR IT, SO AFTER READING THIS, PLEASE, DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.
If you disagree with me, Please, do your own research, after that, you will surely agree if you have properly researched these subjects. it is so obvious that Trump is the only answer, it's not because he's a perfect candidate, but BECAUSE HE WILL DO THE LEAST DAMAGE. Barack, ruined us, Hillary, will DESTROY us. Trump, will keep us stable. To fix what Barack has done to America, not just ONE(1) PRESIDENT will be able to fix it, it will be a journey, but we need REAL PATRIOTS, REAL AMERICANS (NOT JUST BORN HERE, BUT PEOPLE WHO SHARE THE SAME VALUES! CULTURE!)

“The America We Deserve,” which was published in January 2000, makes a single reference to bin Laden. It doesn’t warn “we better be careful with this guy named Osama bin Laden.” It doesn’t say the U.S. “better take him out.” And Trump’s reference to bin Laden as someone “nobody really knew” at the time is wrong, too.
Here’s the lone reference to bin Laden in Trump’s book:
Trump, “The America We Deserve,” January 2000: Instead of one looming crisis hanging over us, we face a bewildering series of smaller crises, flash points, standoffs, and hot spots. We’re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We’re playing tournament chess — one master against many rivals. One day we’re all assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything’s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we’re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin-Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jetfighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it’s on to a new enemy and new crisis.

So Bin laden was already known as a terrorist and Trump is talking out of his a$$ not surprised at all. He loves to tell everyone about his ""prediction"" years later when public perception has already turned i.e. him saying we were wrong to go into Iraq. He was a billionaire and any interview he would of made before 2001 would of gotten major media attention especially if he was  really ""against"" the war.",1,false,0,,,,,,

1) the satanic corporatist elite whose goal is to eventually impliment a NWO which benefits their interests, by destroying any Westerner cultural legacy (through massive forced migration thanks to the wars they started, and funded radical Islam)

2) Trump, who only wants the sovereignety of the US Constitution, the end of a hypothetical world domination by an elitist power, the beginning of a friendly relationship with Putin's Russia, and the restauration of USA' values.

WARNING!!!!!WARNING!!!!

  His ""Great"" means American Business dominating the  world. I saw greed in his eyes when talking about Iran and their oil Then again when talking about  Afghanistan, and their minerals.  He said China his beating us in everything. China is taking the minerals and the Oil.  WE should be taking the minerals and the oil.  Businessmen see the things that belong to others and figure out ways to get their hands on the resources of a nation that do not belong to them. GREEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDD!

He wants to abolish Obama Care but he doesn't stop there. He wants to replace it with Trumpcare. Another National Health Care program.he doesn't see the rights of others.  He see the American people as ""Human resources"". He sees your children as ""human resources.  He sees people as ""things"" he can use!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Abusive men do this to women. They see women as a means to sexual pleasure, not as human beings.  He sees America as something he can use and abuse for his own selfish reasons.   He almost choked saying anything good about George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.  Why? These men saw human beings as free having the right to choose for themselves.
Free to farm, Free to live independent of business men of government.  Washington and Lincoln despise people like trump who have never planned to grow their own food, drink water out of their own well. Trump sees what others have and makes plans to steal it from them somehow.  His best weapon against the ""suckers"" is his smile! ""I get along with everyone"". When I leave I am their friend and they have no idea I just robbed them of everything of any value!!!!!  The Wolve walks away grinning ear to ear!!!!!!
These resources belong to the people of their own countries. The people of Iran can decide to use the oil or not. Oil is an awful thing. Everything created by oil destroys the earth, plastics, synthetics are cancer causing to human beings the same with gasoline etc. The people of Iran should shut them all down.
The minerals in Afghanistan belong to the people of Afghanistan and they should use those minerals to trade with other countries. He should have been appalled that China is stealing the resources of the people of Afghanistan.",1,true,2,,,,,,

Our response because I'm sure a lot of our friends are thinking the same thing.
      Thanks for the comment! You know how the world works! Been there done that! Our grandfather had a multi-million dollar company. I Hate it! Pride abusing people, Greed, using employees, using the Federal Reserve, etc. We know how God works.
           The Bible says come out from amongst them, turn your back on the world follow Jesus Christ! We have turned to a more traditional way of living. 
     The Founding Fathers believed in God. John Locke was someone they learned from. The system you applaud is like the system the British Empire had. Where a few people had all the land and all the wealth. Everyone had to work under these Lords, Ladies, Royalty, etc. Their game they make the rules! America is designed for the individual to be free from others. Their land, their rules!.
         Through the abuse of the Federal Reserve, some people ending up with everything and the people were overthrown losing everything. It was robbery. 
     We believe God is in our mist destroying the old empirical ways of the world that created this unjust system. South America and Russia are all already making remarkable strides towards this goal. Spain doesn't even have a National government anymore! 
     We have Kansas for President Farms for everyone! 
      Benjamin Franklin stated in the Old Farmers Almanac; ""God helps those who help themselves."" 
     He was talking about individuals building their own homes, digging their own wells, having families, building up their farms! God says if a man doesn't work he doesn't eat. God  is talking about farming. 
    It seems easier just to put men working together to cut a bunch of trees, using bulldozers, sawmills, etc. But you ""rape"" the land that way. Driving cars is easier but then you pollute and destroy the environment. Cars are like guns they kill. hundreds of thousands of people die in car accidents because it isn't natural! If we lost as many people in a war America would scream End the War!
      We need to end cars and trucks! Horses, on the other hand, multiply and do not destroy the earth! There may be a few accidents but the injuries aren't as life threatening because you are not going 50-60 miles an hour! Men can live free doing for themselves!  Think about it!",1

The most sensible deduction I can think of  is : It is an attempt on Trump's part to educate society, to better the lot of American citizens. Trump tried to give back to society through education. This is a quality not often seen in the wealthy and I feel he should be given credit for this attempt, rather than scrutinized for the venture .    

Regardless of these issues, Trump is still the most solid presidential candidate. ....and I'm not talking about his weight.

I guess you seen how stupid your comment was finally... The way that argument would go is the same as if the saudis would be owed the cleanup and building contracts after 9/11-2001. The flew planes in to the buildings, nobody wanted that to happen, but they should still be paid for the rebuilding of the towers. Another example would be forcing the victim of a rape to pay her rapists taxi home, he walked in to the wood and he won, so she should pay him to go home now... or the burglar who came in and killed the family, he should be paid now because he is out of bullets and should get new ones... he wasted them on the family inside so now they should give him money to reup on bullets..

If trump gets his was the US will be a target for terror by normal people all over the world, im no Clinton supporter and i actually hope trump wins so the US can see its faults as he will make them so obvious that no amount of cover up will cover them. He will start wars to enrich the US or he will use the threat of war to rob countries. HJe will be successful for a short while until countries like China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Iran, Yemen and many many many many many more groups up and direct real state sponsored terror on US soil. They wont go all out war, but they will send people in and its not just going to be some Muslims from a cave, it will be serious threats, real ones like suitcase nukes and such. The tiny little threat ISIS and the likes is to the US today is fuckall, they dont even case a blip on the threat meter among serious people, but once you really have a state like Russia or China feeling pushed, well then there is a completely diffrent kettle of fish. 

See, you might not get this, but the US is fully equipped to fight armies, but they have very little to fight ""civilian"" or hidden terror threats. You might be able to catch some stupid kids with pressure cookers and kill them before they talk to much about the FBI framing them, but what you think you will do when those people already in your country (as they are in all countries) get the order to set off attacks? You dont think Russia has loyal people in the US already? China? Or you dont think they could get some people under pressure to commit acts? They have the tools to do serious damage and with Trump thinking he can just go around stealing other peoples resources and/or interests.. well the US will be the last place i would want to live in after that.

Secondly, he essentially started the huge debt; you can't increase gov't spending and decrease taxes at the same time. He helped to beat the Soviet Union, but they wouldn't have lasted anyway. He pretty much started the downturn of the country, just to beat a frankly crippled nation. Then all of the presidents after did NOTHING about it. They didn't urge congress at all, or if they did, they did a bad job of it. On the other side, Americans did NOTHING ABOUT IT! We should've forced congress to change. People act like its a monarchy, where they have no control, but they do. The gov't can't stand up to 300mil people. They just can't. And part of the reason why is because of people not going against the huge investors. They don't want the debt to be paid off, so they could make more money, yet they make up the minority; the majority of people suffer because of the debt and we do nothing about it. 

If your representatives don't vote for what their people want, force them out. Take up arms even, its what the second amendment is for. And the country will be done if something doesn't change by this election. If Hillary is voted in it probably won't go well. Even if Trump is, it might not go well. There are other candidates. The two party system has not been working, and the proof is the last 15 years pretty much. I can't even vote as I'm not going to be 18, but I'm smarter than most voters will ever be.

The dollar was dropping and people were losing jobs. In order to direct unsatisfying citzens and boost the economy so they can feed off the people again, the big corporation and families, such as the Morgans, the Rosechild, the Rockefeller etc. Their income depends on the United states dollar, which is directly tied to the oil market. Also for those who does not know, the dollar is not operated nor published by the united states government. The value of dollars are controlled by the federal reserve, which is a company shared by the 10 groups (The Corporation and families). The 10s are the one who rule the whitehouse, not the president, the president is just their announcer. The political funding of the president usually depends on the 10s, and the 10s require loyalty of the president. So if they can direct the boiling people's anger in the country and control the oil market again, the will do it. And they did it.

Now there were president who tried to bring prosperous life to American People. Who? Oh? THE DEAD ONES. The one only dictator of united states ever yet, President Roosevelt during WW2, had complete control over the military and political orders. But they needed him for the war, so he stay alive until the war was winning. Guess what happens after Roosevelt helps American won the war? They poison him and torture him and let him die in agony and pain. Dont believe me? Google it! The cause of Roosevelt's disease was not natural.

Now the recent one is Kennedy. No one knows why the assassin killed him. No one. Thats exactly where the problem lies.

Wake up America, this is not a joke. 

The riches and the powerful does not care about your humble life! They fool you and feed off your hard work. All your hard-earned money will become nothing once they get a chance to manipulate the stock market and gain profit from a depression.",2

z121v13zplzeitqhj04cch1qtkyxwbzgh5s,Linda Offenbach,9 months ago,1470613272110,"The US is doomed by any president of the two parties. It doesn't matter, basically they do the same, because they have fused foreign policy mid 90s, starting with the Project for the New American Century. It wants a greater America...
But how? Not by co-existance but by sucking the planet for the national dreams...

The first thing Trump has done is hiring Michael T Flynn, Democrat, as his foreign advisor, former head of US Defense Intelligence Agency serving Bush and Obama... 
Flynn is calling Iran out exactly the same narrative as Iraq.... 
Everything is a lie, and he is a part of it as well... Trump lies about Iran and Iraq. Iran was invaded by Iraq fully backed by the US via Kuwait.
And now he lies about Iran running over Iraq, because Iran was invited by the US doing so. 
And he fully lies about China... 

The US is creator of all those Arab terrorist organisations by mingling with them and using them for economic geo-interests when it fits, and always wanting some enemy-image to fiercly compete with... 

Why can't the US just co-exist and be a respected friend for holistic prosperity, instead of always hunting for competition and self-declared enemies... Both parties do it.

So Trump is going for the same thing... Trillions in an ever bigger army... Where does the money come from? 
From Wallstreet (as government bond debt + interest), not from the FED or government if that's people might think).
That's why he is close friends with Wallstreet as well, like any candidate... Paulson and Cerberus Capital are running his donation campaign... the biggest sharks on Wallstreet. Clinton the same, mind you (Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase). Trump doesn't finance his own campaign at all by his own money. He just owns assets and value, so he needs cash via Paulson - Cerberus Capital campaign.

One way or another, the US isn't run by any president but by revolving semi-anonymous vague advisors from the Pentagon and Wallstreet serving both administrations the public doesn't see. Can we vote on those?

America should set aside their ego, pride and just try to co-exist, build a holistic friendly people minded society and Take down supergreedy Wallstreet and dismantle vicious Pentagon... The world would become a better place.",0,false,0,,,,,,

If it were not for the Vaticans meddling their would be just normal believers.  Also it's the Vatican and her agents that control the world and agitate wars. It's Not religion because they are are not religious. They are occultists hiding behind religion. But even with that corruption still religion has spilt far less blood. Roughly 7% of wars are actually religious in worlds history. Just because 2 different religions are fighting does not mean it's about religion. Most religions don't control with fear either. Does not drain me either.  Infact you are not forced to follow. Scripture clearly says follow me but I don't want to force you. Also can you name me just 5 religious wars?,0

Use fake terror attacks, a real economical crisis, anarchy etc. And when people are starting to eat their own feces present yourself as an honest new world government.

I would also not let in people from war ridden countries because...I wanna RULE the world not save it, so there wellbeing doesn't concern me.

But lets get back to reality...where refugees have nothing to do with a world-government-building secret organization but with actual wars and people running away from that. 
Iraq is in trouble because of the Americans and their allies, and Syria...well...beside being the tool of two superpowers who missed fighting each other so much...I think its mostly homemade problems. ...and we mustn't forget our dear friends from the Islamic state. 
-
So...WHO thinks taken in refugees is so great? Okay...it has positive effects to have new people in the country (especially for those countries with the shrinking population) and there is nothing wrong with cultural exchange...but neither the refugees nor the politicians who let them in nor the people who welcome them at train stations doesn't think its a big tragedy. But the tragedy is that millions lost their homes not that some people have to live beside people with brown skin whose god got a different name.
-
""I should try to keep people out, since you don't know what people are coming in""

Yeah...thats why we need controlled immigration...we need background checks, officers who listen to the story, qualified people who secure the refugee shelters, psychologists who take care of traumatized people, border control that works together in entire Europe...and you know how we going to achieve this? Right...we spend MONEY.
And what happens every time a politicians spend money for those causes? Rightwingers complain that the refugees are too expensive or that they get the money that they deserve....or things like that. So politicians do what their people want...they keep the whole Refugee-thing as cheap as possible.
But nevertheless you said something very true...we SHOULD let people in IF we know who they are. But would these people who warn us about the doom of the west be suddenly be comfortable living next to a checkt refugee or would they still complain about how he is muslim, and how he doesn't deserves to be in that country and how he is a threat for our culture? So...be honest...wouldn't you complain about refugees if you where 100% sure that none of them is a terrorist?
-
""but only in the region.""
I totally agree and I guess a lot of refugees would rather live in a Syrian or Iraqi city where it is save than in a refugee camp or on the ocean. 
But all we have to do is to.
1. Conquer a few cities on Syrian territory...
2. Secure them with soldiers
3. Supply them with goods.
Are you sure the EU can handle that if they can't even handle people coming over their boarders? I doubt it...but as I said...I'am not opposed to that idea.
Oh...I even had a similar idea but I have a feeling that right-wingers won't like it. Why not charter a few planes and bring people here, so human smugglers don't make money, poor people can afford to flee, we had the power to control and distribute the people as we won't to...but again...I bet there would be a mob (not just) on the airport complaining that there is a conspiracy by liberal governments to ""poison"" their pure little countries with refugees.

Wouldn't you want to destabilize the ethnical civilians of a country through divide&conquer tactics? You need to break the social cohesion of a group of people.. Why won't you use controlled politics both on the 'right' and 'left'? Couldn't this result in dividing the ethnical population of a country? This way you don't only create tension and segregation between the original people of a country and foreigners. But also tensions between the original civilians of a country themselves...

'It has positive effects to have new people in the country (especially for those countries with the shrinking population) and there is nothing wrong with cultural exchange'
So you think there is nothing wrong with the immigration of millions of Chinese into Tibet? And again why are those populations shrinking? And why are only white countries forced to turn into multicultural society's?

'But nevertheless you said something very true...we SHOULD let people in IF we know who they are.'
I never said that, or at least I didn't ment it that way. You can do all backgrounds checks you want, but people with bad intentions are still going to get in.. That reason alone should be enough for a government to close the borders to protect the native civilians of a country.
The thing what people like you don't understand is that we don't have the money to support them. I live in a '1st world country' with 17 million civillians. Around 2,5 million of them live below the poverty line, including 400,000 children. We even have foodbanks were people who don't have a lot money can collect some food every week. Since when do we have money to help all those refugees? Shouldn't a government help their own people first? You know what I mean with 'own'  people.. The people who've lived in the country for years and who're paying taxes for years. Help them first before you're even going to think about helping people who live on the other side of the world.

'But all we have to do is to.
1. Conquer a few cities on Syrian territory...
2. Secure them with soldiers
3. Supply them with goods.'

Don't we have charity's? There have been wars throughout history. Did we always had to conquer city's, before we could send some help??? Should we just ban the Red cross and all those other charity's and take in the whole of Africa as refugees?
Helping refugees should be a charity thing. The people who can miss the money should donate money to charity's, but don't take tax money that should've been for poor civilians of a country. You only make the poorest poorer.",0

""Wouldn't you want to destabilize the ethnical civilians of a country through divide&conquer tactics?""
How do I weaken ethnical civilians by letting in other people? They can still live their live like they used to be...the biggest change for them is that they might see a free percent more foreigners on the street...its not such a big difference. And there is nor reason for me to believe that someone is using a divide and conquer tactic on us...but lets say I'am wrong...and somebody is actually using those kind of tactics...wouldn't it be the best counter to not be divided. If everybody welcomed refugees and does their best to integrate them...the tactic failed. Isn't that what you want? You tread the uprise of people against refugee politics as some kind of automatism...but it isn't. 
And talking about divide and conquer...you know who uses that tactic? Racists, Rightwingers, people who blame one part of the population for the problems of the other.  
-
""Couldn't this result in dividing the ethnical population of a country? ""
Well...thats not even a bad thing in my opinion...IF the different ethnicity get along with each other....so the problem is not that they are coming in but that people want them out.
-
""But also tensions between the original civilians of a country themselves...""
Sidenote: there is a interesting story why conspiracy people can't get their head around wether the evildoers are trying to conquer the world or already ruling it...but that would take that discussion to far...so...lets say that:
IF those who let people in are controlled by the people you talk about than thats contrapoductive for them because they are losing votes. (at least here in Germany...but rightwing parties rise all over europe)...so the only one benefiting from that refugee wave are right-wingers...but right-wingers are not the one who let the people in...they want them to go away!  So...its a simple story of a cause and an unwanted effect not of a agenda....like the majority of things.
The problem is the tension, not what creates the tension. If I get mad every time I see a dutch-man thats MY problem not the problem of dutch people.
-
""but people with bad intentions are still going to get in""
Yes...and I say thats a danger that we should all be able to handle. If a police car crosses a group of young people...it is very likely that one of them or all of them are up to something no good...but that doesn't give the police the right to put all of them in jail...does it?
People who burn down refugee shelters have bad intentions too, and we are not discussing of throwing them out of the country..do we?
So...even if very few among those people have bad intentions the vast majority of them doesn't, the vast majority of them need help.
Plus...there is an interesting thing with Terrorist who planned to attack Berlin Airport
...he was pretty normal when he came here...than he was radicalized by a german group of muslims and THAN turned into a terrorist. The problem was not to let him in but to 
A) let him go BACK to Syria where he further radicalized and fought for the IS
B) not being able to ground him because Police was to dumb.
C) allowing radical muslim groups (of Germans) to operate within our borders. 
So...I don't say there won't be a terrorist who came as a refugee, maybe even a few of them...but that can't be a reason to let mio of people suffer for this.
-
""Since when do we have money to help all those refugees?""
Let me ask you one thing? Was any of the food banks closed? Was social aid cut? Where you forced to pay a single cent for refugees from your own pocket? Has the taxes be raised because of the refugees? No?
The point is...if EVERY cent that is spend for refugees would have been spend on social project otherwise you might have a point...but that isn't the case...or do you think your government where just about to spend mio of Euro for poor people just before the refugees arrived and than changed its mind?
-
""Shouldn't a government help their own people first?""
Yes...and thats what they do. There are a lot of services refugees don't get. People with social aid are not forced to live in rooms with 5 people in it where racist securities and tight restrictions.
-
""The people who've lived in the country for years and who're paying taxes for years.""
Thats a pretty good absolutely none racist definition...people who pay taxes. But you are not getting social services BECAUSE you paid taxes but also because you NEED it. Social security is not a gift but RIGHT (at least in my country and I guess its the same in Holland) 
and we mustn't forget that many of those people who are supported by the state today will pay taxes in the future...if they stay here for a while they will earn more money than they costed....not that this is important...If we wouldn't give social services in advance we wouldn't give anything to children or young people, or very sick people who cost more than they can give to the Social Institutions. And its the same with Refugees.
-
""Help them first before you're even going to think about helping people who live on the other side of the world.""
And THAT attitude is one of the reasons we have so many refugees. 
The UN was begging for payment to keep the refugee camps save and supplied with food and blankets and medicine etc. 
The EU gave them the middle finger. 
And NOW they complain that those people are not staying in the camps. -_-
I think you know what I'am saying...especially because you yourself suggested that we should help the Syrians IN Syria. Do you think the attitude not to spend money for people ""on the other side of the world"" is encouraging politicians to focus on that plan? I don't think so. They could never help the people where they live because people like you would complain about the sums for foreign aid.
-

""Should we just ban the Red cross and all those other charity's and take in the whole of Africa as refugees?""
Well...the red cross can solve some problems down their but not all of them especially not war, unemployment, or vengeful dictatorships.
But if you wanna say we should give way way way way more money to charities so they can help Africans IN Africa...we agree about that.
-
""The people who can miss the money should donate money to charity's,""
Well...okay. But if you want the people to stay in their countries we need amounts of money charity can't gather (unless Jesus returns and forces people to give half of their fortune).
And its the state job to serve its people...so if we are served by attacking IS forces because we don't like the IS why shouldn't we also spend tax money on the task of keeping refugees where they are.
But there is an even easier way to solve the whole refugee crises. The EU must (and I know that sounds crazy) actually work together...if every country takes in a few refugees...no country have to take millions of people at the same time, no country have to spend crazy amounts of money and no native has to freak out because he is surrounded by to many brown faces. So what keeps some governments from taking refugees and make it easier for the countries that take?

Well food banks are for poor people...duh. So what? Are there any shortages because of the refugees? I don't think so because they get their own food and are usually not using food banks.

Yeah...again...this has nothing to do with refugees. Cuts are always happening because the poor and sick are the ones with poor lobbies...thats why their budgets get always cut first...and that happens since the 70ties at least. But keep in mind that the social budget is also the budget for refugees, so their help was also cut and they are victims of the same lobbying work. What happens if those who get social support take on each other: children against elderly...sick people against disabled people, homeless against drug addicts, refugees against social aid receiver?

The REAL Patriots are the one helping refugees, making Germany one of the most respected countries during the whole refugee crises, making people wave German flags or writing signs that they love our chancellor.

""you don't have any nationalistic feelings with your country or ethnical feelings with Germans.""
Ever been to a football game Holland vs. Deutschland? Believe me there is enough patriotism and even nationalism in our country.
But nationalism usually causes problems so...if there was none I wouldn't be sad.
And why should we have ethnical feelings about other Germans? Why not have feelings about the ENTIRE population?
Why should I limit my feelings to my right neighbor but not include my left neighbor just because his grandparents came from a different country.
The Germans are a mixture out of 100 of different people...and what MADE them German what made them fight and die for Germany was that they believed that it isn't a difference where you come from...the first German patriots fought to get rid of the hundred of micro states and create one big republic....so it is 100% German spirit to just include a few more people and to teach the values of equality, kindness and unity. 
And if you complain about a lack of people who love Germany...most refugees love Germany...they love it so much that they leaving their homeland, and risking death...what have YOU risked to become dutch?
Love shouldn't be based on you being you but on you doing stuff to be proud of.

'That reason alone should be enough for a government to close the borders to protect the native civilians of a country.'
This scenario is from fantasy land...not the part where people are threaten our citizens but where all those citizens are native Germans. The IS is threatening people IN Germany...not just Germans.
Most rape victims of refugees are not German natives but other refugees...and the reason for that is unqualified or to less security in refugee homes. And again...I'am not for letting in rapists...but when is a rapist a rapist? Right not if he belongs to a group with rapists in it but when he actually raped someone. 
Thats like not allowing man to enter the country. And again...the crime rates for violent crimes are really low with refugees (if you don't count them beating up each other).

Because of the 'denazification' you don't have access to any Holocaust revisionism research at all. You don't have acces to history books and the jews filter your internet. I can send you websites and documentary's but you can't see them. 
The jewish Bolsheviks wanted to conquer the whole of Europe(Operation Thunderstorm/ Operazia Groza). This is a fact. Hitler was just in time with attacking the Soviet Union.
The Germans, English, USA etc signed the Geneva convention. The Russians didn't. It was strictly forbidden for Germans to rape etc.(of course some of them did it, but if they got caught, they would've been murdered by the Germans themselves). The Germans were seen as hero's in Eastern-Europe when they freed them for a while. The biggest rape in history was on the German civilians by the Russians. But I'm almost 100% sure you are a Western German, you don't know this story's. Eastern Germans are more aware on how they've been fucked by the allies.
The Germans had no other choice then to attack the Netherlands. The Dutch government called themselves 'neutral', but they allowed English plains to fly over the Netherlands to bomb the Ruhr area. The Germans protested in writing a lot of times. They had to attack the Netherlands to protect the Ruhr area. At first I fully hated the nazi's. But I realize that Hitler was the only one who had offered peace several times to the English with many economical benefits for Western Europe. They offered to get out of Holland several times.... My family suffered during the war because the English/zionist warmongers didn't accepted the peace offers. Not because of the Germans. The Germans fought for the future of Europe, and the allies fought for the existence of the international jewish parasites.",0

About the Operation Groza...yes it is possible that Stalin planned to attack HItler...according to that one russian historian, while all other historians think that Stalin didn't planned that..but whatever...the point is that HItler attacked first and who attacks first started the war.
That was the reason that the Dutch government supported the british forces...what else they where supposed to do when its eastern neighbor starts to conquer all countries around them? Britain had no intention to attack Holland, so of course the Dutch wanted the Alllies to win the war....at least most dutch people.

Nevertheless. No you don't have 'uncensored internet and acess to all those shady revisionist sides.' They also ban video's in the Netherlands and other country's were Holocaust denial is forbidden. But especially in Germany. Shall we try it? Do you want me to send you a video wich is banned in Germany? Why do they need a law anyway? Why is the Holocaust the ONLY event in history wich you can't minimalize/deny. It looks like some people have spread some lies and they need a law to protect it.

'yes it is possible that Stalin planned to attack HItler...according to that one russian historian, while all other historians think that Stalin didn't planned that...the point is that HItler attacked first and who attacks first started the war.'
Do you even understand the idea of Jewish Bolshevism? It wasn't an idea for just Russia.. It was an idea for the world.. Oke Hitler attacked first.. But why didn't the allies declared war on Soviet-Union when they conquered the half of Poland? And why was the world looking away when Stalin attacked Finland? Seems to me Hitler was the only one who cared about the Finnish.. Do you even know the reasons why Hitler conquered 'Poland' or better said old German land and a piece of Poland? And the allies started a war to save the poor Polish from the evil nazi's, but after the war they gave Poland and half of Europe to the Soviet-Union...You probably have a very logical explenation for that.
And was Hitler right when he said that the jews were behind Bolshevism? Or is it Nazi-propaganda that the first murderous government of the Soviet-Union was 90% jewish?
'Yeah...when he realized that he can't win a war against so many foes...thank goodness Hitler overestimated the German strikeforces.'
Hitler never offered peace offers when he was losing the war. He offered A LOT of GENEROUS peace offers in the beginning of the war. Like after the fall of France, he offered to get out of Western-Europe. So yes my family had suffered during the war because the zionists/English didn't accepted it!
'You realize Poland is a part of eastern europe too? Go ask some polish seniors how liberated they felt about the German troops.'
Go ask some Polish seniors how liberated they felt when the allies stabbed them in the back and sold their country to the Soviets.... 
'There have been rape cases even in my family. Kharma is a bitch.'
Germans like you deserve to die out. Disgusting creature.
'No...they fought for power and a future in which all non Germans are slaves to the Germans...Hitler made that pretty clear.'
You don't know a thing about National Socialism. Loving your own country and people, doesn't mean that you hate others.. The German army was the most multicultural/ multi ethnical army of all times. Even jews fought with the Germans, some of them earning high medals. At the same time blacks were only allowed in the kitchen of the army in the USA!
'The same parasites that he allowed to have lucrative businesses in his empire? Hitler didn't cared about the jewish bankers...he hated jews in general.'
Isn't Hitler the only person in the history who's ever jailed a Rothschild? Didn't he create a state bank with 0% interest for the Germans?
I don't have problems with muslims. I rather don't want them in my country, but I've no problems with any race or culture. Also no problems with ordinary jews. I only hate elite jewish parasites, fake 'refugee' welfare parasites and people like you.",0

Doesn't make sense to me. Cutting off a country's money doesn't seem like a good foundation of a relationship.
Also: he says ""global warming is priority right now"" and ""anti-terrorism should be priority"". I'm sorry but that is vote-bait. Chances of dying in a terror act is virtually 0.

Donald Trump's genius: build a wall, put badges on Muslims, and trying to bring a guy to court for calling his dad an orangutan. I'm not even kidding. Donald Trump tried to bring Bill Maher to court for saying his dad was an orangutan. Do you really want someone like that, who treats the justice system like a toy, and already used his power to try to silence someone that he didn't like, and someone who took serious offense to someone that make a stupid joke to be president?

 You need to do your research.What Donald Rumps' nephew , and his sibling(s) did was react to the fact that they had been written out of Frederick Srs will. This allegedly happened when Federick Sr was near death with Alzheimers and was not compos mentis.  .Donald ( and possibly some of his other siblings) got their daddy to change his will, leaving their deceased brothers ( Freddy Jr) children out of it. Prior to this, Fedddy Jr and his heirs were included.

JUST IN: Trump Does The Unthinkable
POLITICS
July 29, 2016
A+A-
EMAILPRINT

Donald Trump is a racist, bigot, sexist, xenophobe, anti-Semitic and Islamophobe — did I miss anything? The left and the media launch these hideous kinds of attacks at Trump everyday; yet, nothing could be further from the truth about the real estate mogul. As an entertainment journalist, I’ve had the opportunity to cover Trump for over a decade, and in all my years covering him I’ve never heard anything negative about the man until he announced he was running for president. Keep in mind, I got paid a lot of money to dig up dirt on celebrities like Trump for a living so a scandalous story on the famous billionaire could’ve potentially sold a lot of magazines and would’ve been a “yuge” feather in my cap. Instead, I found that he doesn’t drink alcohol or do drugs, he’s a hardworking businessman and totally devoted to his beloved wife and children. On top of that, he’s one of the most generous celebrities in the world with a heart filled with more gold than his $100 million New York penthouse.
In 2004, the first season of “The Apprentice” aired and at that time I worked as an entertainment columnist for the “RedEye Edition of the Chicago Tribune” and as a freelancer for “Us Weekly”. I had a gut feeling that Chicago contestant, Bill Rancic, was going to win the reality show. So I contacted him and covered the hit show the entire season. I managed to score an invite to New York for the show’s grand finale and after-party. This is where I first met Trump and got to ask him a few questions. That year, Rancic did win “The Apprentice”. I attended “The Apprentice” finale the next two years in a row. Between that and the frequent visits Trump and his family made to Chicago during the construction of their Trump International Hotel & Tower, I got a chance to meet most of his family too and I’ve had nothing but positive experiences with them. Since the media has failed so miserably at reporting the truth about Trump, I decided to put together some of the acts of kindness he’s committed over three decades which has gone virtually unnoticed or fallen on deaf ears.
In 1986, Trump prevented the foreclosure of Annabell Hill’s family farm after her husband committed suicide. Trump personally phoned down to the auction to stop the sale of her home and offered the widow money. Trump decided to take action after he saw Hill’s pleas for help in news reports.
In 1988, a commercial airline refused to fly Andrew Ten, a sick Orthodox Jewish child with a rare illness, across the country to get medical care because he had to travel with an elaborate life-support system. His grief stricken parents contacted Trump for help and he didn’t hesitate to send his own plane to take the child from Los Angeles to New York so he could get his treatment.
In 1991, 200 Marines who served in Operation Desert Storm spent time at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina before they were scheduled to return home to their families. However, the Marines were told that a mistake had been made and an aircraft would not be able to take them home on their scheduled departure date. When Trump got wind of this, he sent his plane to make two trips from North Carolina to Miami to safely return the Gulf War Marines to their loved ones.
In 1995, a motorist stopped to help Trump after the limo he was traveling in got a flat tire. Trump asked the Good Samaritan how he could repay him for his help. All the man asked for was a bouquet of flowers for his wife. A few weeks later Trump sent the flowers with a note that read: “We’ve paid off your mortgage.”
In 1996, Trump filed a lawsuit against the city of Palm Beach, Florida accusing the town of discriminating against his Mar-a-Lago resort club because it allowed Jews and blacks. Abraham Foxman, who was the Anti-Defamation League Director at the time, said Trump “put the light on Palm Beach – not on the beauty and the glitter, but on its seamier side of discrimination.” Foxman also noted that Trump’s charge had a trickle-down effect because other clubs followed his lead and began admitting Jews and blacks.
In 2000, Maury Povich featured a little girl named Megan who struggled with Brittle Bone Disease on his show and Trump happened to be watching. Trump said the little girl’s story and positive attitude touched his heart. So he contacted Maury and gifted the little girl and her family with a very generous check.
In 2008, after Jennifer Hudson’s family members were tragically murdered in Chicago, Trump put the Oscar-winning actress and her family up at his Windy City hotel for free. In addition to that, Trump’s security took extra measures to ensure Hudson and her family members were safe during such a difficult time.
In 2013, New York bus driver Darnell Barton spotted a woman close to the edge of a bridge staring at traffic below as he drove by. He stopped the bus, got out and put his arm around the woman and saved her life by convincing her to not jump. When Trump heard about this story, he sent the hero bus driver a check simply because he believed his good deed deserved to be rewarded.
In 2014, Trump gave $25,000 to Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi after he spent seven months in a Mexican jail for accidentally crossing the US-Mexico border. President Barack Obama couldn’t even be bothered to make one phone call to assist with the United States Marine’s release; however, Trump opened his pocketbook to help this serviceman get back on his feet.
In 2016, Melissa Consin Young attended a Trump rally and tearfully thanked Trump for changing her life. She said she proudly stood on stage with Trump as Miss Wisconsin USA in 2005. However, years later she found herself struggling with an incurable illness and during her darkest days she explained that she received a handwritten letter from Trump telling her she’s the “bravest woman, I know.” She said the opportunities that she got from Trump and his organizations ultimately provided her Mexican-American son with a full-ride to college.
Lynne Patton, a black female executive for the Trump Organization, released a statement in 2016 defending her boss against accusations that he’s a racist and a bigot. She tearfully revealed how she’s struggled with substance abuse and addiction for years. Instead of kicking her to the curb, she said the Trump Organization and his entire family loyally stood by her through “immensely difficult times.”
Trump’s kindness knows no bounds and his generosity has and continues to touch the lives of people from every sex, race and religion. When Trump sees someone in need, he wants to help. Two decades ago, Oprah asked Trump in a TV interview if he’d run for president. He said: “If it got so bad, I would never want to rule it out totally, because I really am tired of seeing what’s happening with this country.” That day has come. Trump sees that America is in need and he wants to help – how unthinkable!

No you do not, so quit telling me everything is going down the drain, you are absolutely clueless, our economy is booming, the unemployment is the lowest in decades. Globalism is good, it will bring more good than bad, it will bring prosperity, it will attract foreign investment, more people from other countries will start their businesses here and get Ph.D's, furthering our military, medicine, sciences. In my college in NYC - every professor was an immigrant or child of direct immigrant, You think American government lets everyone in? You have any idea how they do background checks and make sure only educated people with good morale end up with green cards? Trust me america is getting a lot of return on their little green card investment, the best minds are selected to come here, entire europe wants to be here, entire china wants to be here, this is the greatest country in the world, we are top of the line in research, medicine, and military, and we need to stay that way. Your cries are not from the fact that our country goes ""down the drain,"" it is because you don't want to share this greatness, but with a right balance.",0

We have an economy based off 0% interest rates for 8 straight years. That has created bubbles everywhere. The stock market especially. 
We've had less than 2% GDP growth for 8 straight years. That's the worst growth in our entire history by  any president.  Home ownership is down 60%, the worst in 50 years. Wages are lower today than 18 years ago. 
Black youth unemployment rate under Obama is 58%.
The jobs created are part time, low paying jobs. Mostly due to Obamacare's mandate. 
The unemployment rate is fake. It only accounts for people getting benefits. Once they run out you're considered employed. 100 million people out of the workforce. $20 trillion in debt with nothing to show for it. 
And the fact you say ""globalism is good"" shows you're not even American. You want to surrender this country. Not only have I destroyed you with facts, but I make a good case that you're not even American. 
Boom. You are owned.",1

Black youth employment depends on what black youth is into, educated black youth gets the jobs no problem, but for the rest - there are only that many McDonalds stores. Part time jobs are financial maneuver to avoid paying for employee health insurance - however majority of jobs do not do this, its primarily corporate type of crap to shave off pennies here and there. I never claimed to be a born american, in fact i made it easy for you by telling you about the process, and trust me those people that want to come here, at the same time do not want to come here, but they must because the reality is the rest of the world sucks and is unpredictable, here everything is stable, and yes, I am actually an american now, i took an oath you haven't, and i contributed to this economy since I was 13. Globalism is very good for the economy, yes the very negative aspect of it is loss of identity, but that's a train with no breaks, and it will happen whether you like it or not. At least you know who to hate, blacks, muslims, jews, take your pick and hate. But if you did not have them - you would hate someone from another state because they talk differently than you, so all this crap at the same time unifies",0

First off, NYC is a totally different real estate market than anywhere on the planet. During the housing crisis in 2008, NYC wasn't even really hit. Its so wealthy that it defies other standards. So you use NYC as a representation, meanwhile you are overlooking everywhere else in the country. That shows how uneducated you are. Black youth is black youth. Educated or not. And those low employment stats are true for all young professionals. And the fact you degrade black people to McDonalds jobs when in reality all races work McDonalds jobs shows your racist hypocrisy always found with democrats.
and no.. everything is not ""stable"". I crushed you with 10 points to illustrate why it isn't, yet you sit here like a total dumbass and just say it is. I give facts and evidence, you give words and bullshit because you don't have a clue of what you're talking about. 
And the best comment is a foreigner like you saying ""globalism will happen whether you like it or not"".. all you tell us is that you're not only a person who came here to America, but you don't belong or deserve to be here!!! You're telling us to surrender our country whether we like it or not.. see that? It's all good, you say whatever you like.. but im just pointing out what you really think of America and why you really shouldn't be allowed here. It's people like you who are the reason America is going to hell. It's sad. You revealed why you dont belong here.",1

I do not degrade black people to McDonald's but it's just a simple fact, I've never seen a white person working there unless its somewhere 100 miles into the middle of nowhere where black people don't go, they prefer the comfort and benefits of large cities which have a lot of money to subsidize their living and nice job quotas - for the literate, and part time job opportunities like McDonalds if there's no education. Anyway. I think you are failing to swallow what I've said in my previous comment - immigrants are the driving force of america, immigrants and jews, jews keep the government, banks, stock market, real estate, immigrants produce services, new products, research, at least that has been true until now. Financial institutions increasingly, exclusively, hire more and more hard working chinese, who come out of rat hole slums and dont need a lot of space to work, so you can fit more of them in an office, and they are so hard working that you get two fold return on your investment if you hire them. White Europeans are in equal demand due to being bilingual and often multilingual, even hispanics are worth more than average joe because they can do business with south america, yes most of these cases are people who were born into it and their experience has shaped them into what they are, but it is not an excuse to spread hate because you are too lazy to learn a language or two and move to NYC instead of thinking all your problems can be solved with an over-regulated gun. Trump grew up in NYC, and let me let you in on a little secret, rich people, like him, are terrified of poor people, a poor person for someone wealthy is pure evil.",0

All those people you mention came to the USA LEGALLY. 
We don't need or want ILLEGALS. By law they are not supposed to be here. 
So your entire comment is based off a false statement. 
See how above I said ""you're not qualified to debate me""? See that?

Illegals shouldn't be here. 80% of those who come illegally go on welfare and get taxpayer funded benefits. That's not help, that's a burden. And they take that money from black people who can't find jobs and are American. 
And, B: those jobs would be happily filled by American workers. My sister was a babysitter during high school. You say they are ""cheaper"" workers, meaning you promote slavery actually.

Half of that money is spent on creating more mess in other countries and the other half is spent on cleaning them up. The Clinton's make money as commission in both ways.

Banks MUST print money, and inflation will soon come probably by the end of next year, because minimum wage will go up, and because inflation will boost the economy a bit. If banks printed money like you say the dollar would be worth on par with russian rubel lol, use your head a little come on.. 
Banks land money on the other hand, money you can use to your advantage, like saving money; if stupid people use that money to buy things they cannot afford - that doesn't make banks evil and a target for destruction, and as I said - this is not even on the issue list.
What you say about trump taking back the power makes no sense what so ever, it's like saying you will take away the power of a cruise ship and make the guests pedal in the engine room instead, it wont happen, the government, ESPECIALLY most local governments have not gotten a clue on what to do, nor do they possess the fraction of the knowledge and experience the banks, well especially one in particular, do.
Bernie wasn't even on the planet earth, if he was - it was on a tree in bolivia smoking something, because what he said was even more moronic than what trump says.

It is much much deeper than that, and it doesn't just extend internationally, it is global, and the breaks on it are equivalent to chinese bicycle breaks on a a bullet train. Hint #2: Venezuela lol",0

Also how is money printed? It's put into bonds which are held by the banks. Also, given the fact that interest rates have been next to 0% the last 8 years, it's made that money very cheap (for now) to print. 
If you keep eluding to the Central Banks its the same story. European nations are underwater in debt as well. What the left wingers want to do is create so much debt, that we default and essentially take down the entire economy, start over fresh with global communism. They're very close to achieving it.

He's coming in to rescue this country that has been run into the ground by politicians, and especially the democrats the last 8 years. Take this Colin Kaepernick situation in the news now. He didnt stand for the national anthem. His reasoning was to blame America for crimes against African Americans. In reality, he should be protesting democrat policies that blacks have been voting for the last 70 years. 
Black people were actually far better off BEFORE the Civil Rights movement. Black people made more money, they held more jobs, less people were in poverty, less crime, 85% of black families stuck together. I recently reviewed various statistics and it was mind blowing. You'd never think it until you saw the math. Unreal. Trump is going to be phenomenal for black people. There will be no president in history other than Lincoln that will do what Trump does.

You call the national debt ""irrelevant"". It's not. It's a very important factor for many reasons. 2 major reasons is that it costs us $700 billion per year just to pay interest on it. The government takes in around $2.5 trillion every year, so that means almost 1/3 of our revenue goes to making interest payments on the debt. 
How is that irrelevant? 
Social Security and Medicare costs $400 billion per year and we complain that we don't have the money and the system no longer works. Seems to me that if we had no debt, it wouldn't be any issue. And that's one example. We could talk about infrastructure and millions of other places we could be spending $700 billion per year. I'm sure even you can think of some good ideas for where that money should go...
So I'm just curious, I'm giving you one basic example of why the huge national debt matters. I'm specifically telling you reasons, not some vague and unspecific comment... and you're here trying to bash me by saying ""oh you don't understand economics"" and ""the debt is irrelevant""... clearly I've given factual evidence as to why it very much DOES matter. So are you just here to be an asshole? Or do you really believe the debt isn't any issue? It's one or the other dude, pick one.",1

The time is now for ALL of us - male, female, young, old, from all nationalities & walks of life to put aside our differences & become one nation of PATRIOTIC AMERICANS - and watch a great future unfold before our very eyes.  God Bless everyone & God bless America.  #TRUMPNATION2016",0,false,0,,,,,,

The interesting thing on the bankruptcy showed his ability to predict the market and save his companies massive losses. In fact the lead Banker that lost out on a massive loan when Trump filed publicly stated that it was the smartest thing he has witnessed from a business. That it's common practice but Trumps timing was perfect. That it didn't hurt the bank in the least and they not only expect a percentage of loans to be lost this way but prepare for it. So to bring up ""Bankruptcies"" is to sing his praises. In fact I hope he follows Ron Paul's plan and dissolves the Federal reserve and thereby instantly dissolving our 24 Trillion dollar debt.

z12lyjb51x3sstkot04cilzqbmjusvtykuk0k,Numaan Rashid,11 months ago,1465342934182,"""they wanna blow up our cities and they wanna blow up our country"" - Donald trump 

when he refers to ""they"" does he not realize that ""they"" are the same cunts that the country of USA is funding ?

And not once has any Muslim country declared war on USA not once ! yet USA is ALWAYS in some Muslim countries killing a lot of innocent people and fighting the same people that they themselves funded 

And then they wanna turn USA into people that hate Muslims from projecting ""Isis"" and all that shit into the media and the brains of ppl that still watch the news !

People say non radical muslims aren't doing anything to help with the situation we have with these radical Muslims

number 1 - a lot of Muslims are doing there bit through social media mainly dislylayig the truth and helping people to understand that Islam and terrorism has no association or correlation whatsoever but too many ignorant people can't seem to understand it !
number 2 - this shit doesn't make sense ! there's only one type of Muslim, not this radical and non radical and extremist and non extremist and good Muslim and bad muslim, there's just Muslim ! you're either a Muslim or you're not you can be a terrorist a satanist you can shout Allahu Akbar all u effin want, but if u kill innocent people no matter what religion or/and  you kill yourself, you are not Muslim !
its that simple !
let's call terrorists what they are, Terrorists !

when the church's of england and Ireland and USA etc were charged guilty of having sexually abused and raped little children, did the media portray them as
""christian rapists"" or ""christian child molesters"" or ""Christians sexually abusing children"" 
I don't think so ! and if that was said please do send me a link of some sort so I can check it out but I guarantee it wasn't said, guarantee it.

so if you don't say that shit
why refer terrorists who say there are Muslim But not Muslim as ""Muslim terrorists"" or ""Islamic terrorists"" 
A terrorist has nothing to do with Islam a terrorist is an unjust criminal just like many of our politicians and believe it or not the biggest terrorists in the world where suits and ties !

its wrong to refer to a terrorist as Muslim
just like its wrong to refer to a terrorist has someone from any religious belief or faith because no religion or faith teaches terrorism ! 

those satanic priests shouldn't be called ""Christian rapists/child molesters/sexual abusers"" and rightly so they were not called that, they were called exactly what they were, rapists and satanic child molesters 

same way these satanic terrorists shouldn't be called ""Islamic terrorists"" or "" Muslim terrorists"" and wrongly so they were and are called EXACTLY that. 

Muslims have nothing to do with terrorists but have to go through the shit of people speaking and thinking wrongly of us because of the actions taken by terrorists who claim they are Muslim but are not because they violate the religion with there unjust and vile actions which makes them a satanist more than anything but the world doesn't seem to understand this and it's about time it does !",2,true,6,,,,,,

Like someone said ""Not every islamic human is a terrorist, but every terrorist is an Islamic human"", so until Donald Trump fights the ISIS and give peace to middle east, this is a fair and good idea to protect every American. So what ethnic group is threaten by Donald Trump to be a fascist in your opinion?",1

.. I don't know where to start - how about this..... Like someone said ""Not every islamic human is a terrorist, but every terrorist is an Islamic human.

You can't possibly be serious about that. You know that there are lots of non islamic terrorists, right?

Trump offered a woman of colour a job - that's great. Does that mean he doesn't say heinous things about various ethnic groups?

Where did the comment about gay marriage come from?",0

Timothy James McVeigh
Ted Kaczynski
Joseph Stack

This is because of the media, they have branded SD has racists because they want to limit immigration, but people still see the problems with immigration so they vote for them, but they can't admit to it in public without committing social suicide. It's fucking hilarious how a million Swedes vote for SD in secret.

When I have spoken to people about these issues, most actually agree with what SD says, but when I mention them outright they get uncomfortable. For instance, I had a discussion with my mother a few months ago and it was so clear that her views where in line with what SD preaches, but when I mentioned that I had sympathies for SD (I'm actually a full blown supporter, but I won't admit that. See what I mean?) she implied I was a racist even though we basically share the same political views. I would even go so far as calling my mom a nationalist based on her statements.",5

If you thought paying your taxes was ""unjust"" or ""unfair"" should you be allowed to just not pay without being reprimanded? no. there are laws on immigration for a reason and deportation is the only true way to enforce it.

Although i have no firsthand experience outside the US long-term as a citizen, i do have a good basis of knowledge based on history of politics around the world. I am struggling to see the point you are trying to make. America has its own issues that differ from greatly from nations around us and cannot be compared by any means. As a welfare state, Our proximity to a country as economically needy as mexico gives huge incentive to immigrate legally or illegally and this huge push-pull factor for immigrants calls for harder policy or more fortification. Although i agree trumps rhetoric is moronic at best, i do see the points he is attempting to make. You are correct in pointing out his character issues or perceived character issues and that is a large problem when trying to relate and work with foreign diplomats, but his inwardly concerned policies is what America really needs. Which leads me to the point that our foreign policy has been an absolute WRECK since the cold-war. Inwardly concerned policies is all that we need to attempt to fix our mess of what we call foreign policy. And in response to your remark about his manipulation and running 3 terms, this has happened before, FDR, he is the reason the 2 term law became an actual LAW and not just an acceptance of the presidents. Nevertheless, his 3rd term never proved to be an actual issue so i do not see the point you are making. If you must know, i hate political parties and therefor do not belong to one. Which is my exact reasoning for beginning to value trump as he is one of the most moderate presidential candidates we have had to date. The conservative GOP hates him and so do the liberals. POLITICAL PARTIES HAVE KILLED THIS NATIONS INTEGRITY. i believe trump may be able to stop this trend. And don't bring up other nations because in all honestly, as i said before, these are American issues, not seen elsewhere.",0

You are just led to believe he wants to use dictator-like power because of the moronic language he uses and the media's(party controlled) hyper-focus on this. These controlling parties WANT everyone to believe he is power hungry because they know and are scared that he is the most moderate pres. candidate in a very long time.

An elitist, narcissist, who despite what his imbecilic supporters say about him, was gifted his wealth along with a profitable business model. He is not a successful business man, or human. Multiple failed business, bankruptcies, marriages and a simplistic, reductionist view of the world, of humankind and race relations.

He speaks to the lowest common denominator of your country - lower socio-economic groups and xenophobic people, the latter of which is sadly the majority of your population due to the anti-immigrant, brainwashing propaganda you are all spoon-fed on a daily basis through your vapid media.

But perhaps worst is the fact that he is exploiting your ignorance. He is making as much a mockery of the political process and the respect of your citizens as the DNC is with their election rigging and control of the media sources that espouse their views with little criticism. Trump feeds you lies. He tells you climate change is a Chinese-engendered hoax, yet fortifies his coastal resorts and cites climate change as the cause. Look it up. Trump is about preserving his two core interests - his own financial prosperity and the propagation of the TRUMP name and brand.

And you stupid fuckers fall for it. Willingly condemning your children and future generations to a continued society of shit policies, of the degradation and vocational exploitation of your most vulnerable and in-need, the disintegration of your middle class, the profiteering and corporate freedom for the elite class, and most threateningly, the complete destruction of the environment for financial gain, the effects of which, if you ignorant pieces of shit would bother to do any research, is already being felt by third-world countries, by the death of flora and fauna in places such as Australia, and in less than a decade will threaten our very way of life with sea level rise, death of vital ecosystems and rising temperatures that will cost us trillions of dollars in global GDP as conditions will be too hot to work in. Perhaps that one might be easiest for you dumb fucks to process - it may be too hot for those Mexicans to build your beloved wall for you, oh and for free if I recall correctly.

I was in a bit of a foul mood when I made my original response to your comment, so please forgive my harshness or rudeness. The answer is, and feel free to tell me your State, perhaps I can help...Connecticut's main site for the ""General Assembly"" is this one: https://www.cga.ct.gov/
I recommend you find the page for your General Assembly or legislative .gov State site and then enter in google as a search as follows: site:whatever.whatever.gov <search terms> obviously without the < > but you do include site:cga.ct.gov for example. Maybe you already know this but if you put say ""how to"" in quotes like that as a search, it'll find those words in that order.. just a little tip for Googling. So yeah they do make it it seems, a bit obfuscated intentionally. I've contacted Senator Richard Blumenthal and had him respond to my emails before.. but when I ask if he could explain to me in general how and what I can participate in at the State Legislative Building here, he didn't respond.
In short here in CT though, you show up in the morning bright and early in person, to the address of the legislative building itself. You and everyone else who are ""Private Citizens"" (the legal term for common man basically) will get paper copies of the daily agenda with what room everything is in and you can do things like testify before the Senate/Congress or committees and such in favor of a Bill or against them, as well. For the large part, in most States, the general public can attend basically whatever meeting is going on in the Capitol. You can also start locally if that's easier, and it often is, and look up your city's website and find their calendar. Often they show you a stupid calendar first which is just like public holidays and stuff like that - you need to find the one which lists all the committee and council meetings. Those you usually also may attend. If you're interested in a free of charge press credential issued by a conservative sort of corporation online just let me know, too. All you do is enter your name on the PDFs and print out your credential. We do have a free press :) But you need not be in the press to participate, either.. just a thought. It can  sometimes afford you extra information more easily, and sometimes make people ON the boards/committes you're sitting in on not like you so much. .. but that's OK :)
God Bless.

Donald Trump is a friend of the Clintons. Donald Trump has donated money to Hillary's pet projects and she attended his wedding. My question is how damned stupid do my fellow Republicans have to be to gobble up all the BS and lies Trump tells? He is a bought and sold puppet. Hillary is loving this because only Donald Trump could make her look like a viable choice for President. I have no proof but I bet the Clinton's friends in power have already financed the campaign of Trump. 132 other Americans have more money than him so please spare me the garbage about him not needing the funding. It took Obama several hundred million to get elected president.  Not even a Billionaire throws away hundreds of millions or even tens of millions on a casino table with one roll of the dice. Give yourself a pat on the back Republicans because although you don't know it you have already elected Hillary via a Trump GOP nomination.
 As a decent Republican, who is not as amoral  as you guys, I will stay home on election day.  Trump will get destroyed by Hillary in the general election and she will enact tougher gun control and more handouts for bums that don't want to work. Don't blame me because I voted for Kasich in the primary in a state which he won and in a state that won't come out and vote for Donald Trump ""the leader of chumps"".",0,true,1,,,,,,

 As a Republican, I obviously have more than a few friends and family members that are avid Trump supporters so I apologize if my words towards his supporters were more than a little bit condescending. I just feel that a Rubio or Kasich nomination would have fared better against Clinton because of independent voters. I think the general election will be a landslide victory for Hilary and that frigid old dried up daughter of Satan will say  that the election was a mandate for change and she will push hard to close gun shows and enact a 2nd Clinton assault rifle ban. I believe that America is doomed and an eventual secession of states from the union will result in the next 20 to 50 years. That job will be much harder without decent weaponry. According to the FBI UCI so called ""assault rifles"" are only used in about 1 % of all gun crimes while handguns are the overwhelming choice of criminals. So why no handgun ban? Because handguns don't represent the threat to the state that high capacity rifles do. They are the tools of rebellion.",0

He can make all the claims he wants, and plenty of Alex Jonsers support him simply because he's something new, a voice that can be talked to, negotiated with, or manipulated, rather than just playing ball with the establishment.

I also stated that Trump inspires the same fluffy faith in people that the entire country felt for Obama in 2008. And you, saying ""I respect the man. Believe it or not, he's smart. Trump 2016.""

Your naming George Washington and Lincoln  and mentioning that George Washington never told a lie.  That is what I learned in the 1st grade.  You have one of the biggest vineyards in Virginia just 2 miles from the home (Monticello) of one of Americas founding fathers and the most famous presidents  Thomas Jefferson who authored the declaration of independents.  The declaration of independents is now used by many free countries in the world.  Yet when your opinion was asked about replacing one of the greatest Generals and Presidents Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman (I want to vomit) you Mr. Trump said more or less "" I don't know, maybe Jackson should stay on the $20 bill maybe they should change another denomination like the $2 bill.  FYI Mr. Trump the president in the $2 bill is guess who, your neighbor just down the road from your  vineyard the great President Thomas Jefferson.  Mr. Trump you should really visit Monticello and learn about your neighbor.  President Jefferson was also an architect and inventor having designed and built the University of Virginia.  You and him with the exception of your dumbness would have gotten along just fine.  Although  Mr. Trump I do support your views and I may vote for you in the general election, please do not say your smart.  Some people may equate being smart because your a billionaire. You do not need to be smart to make the millions or billions.  You just need to inherit the 40 million dollars your daddy left you, not the 1 million you said you borrowed, you need to have perseverance and work hard which we all know you do.

1) Trumps rotten fruit that is as unchrist like as someone can get 
2) he brags about the many women he's been with (fornication) 
3) has been divorced twice and is now on his third marriage (adulterer) 
4) says he's never repented and doesn't feel he needs to ask God for forgiveness 
5) The Trump empire is rooted in prostitution, drugs, booze, and gambling. 
6) the number 23 is prominent in his old coat of arms (23 is a important number in the occult)
7) his new coat of arms uses a double headed three legged eagle. The double headed eagle represents a pagan god of war and is connected to the sun god. And the three legs are also connected to paganism and is connected to the Greek sun god, Apollo 
8) his penthouse is decorated to resemble the temple of Apollo, the Greek sun god 
9) The Trump tower in Chicago looks like the Tower of Babel 
10) The Trump World Tower in New York stands above and looks down on the United Nations buildings, where you have representation of every nation of the world. And the Trump World Tower is were Trump lives and runs the Trump empire. Consider now that Satan told Jesus from a mountain which allowed them to see every nation of the world that he could rule all of it if he submitted to him (Satan)
11) a title for Satan is that he is the ruler of this world and the meaning of Donald is ruler of the world. 
Hmmmm. And people still think he is the ""Trumpet"" and has been chosen by God to lead the US against Satan's army of Darkness? Think again people. Wake up!!

We’re not playing the chess game to end all chess games anymore. We’re playing tournament chess — one master against many rivals. One day we’re all assured that Iraq is under control, the UN inspectors have done their work, everything’s fine, not to worry. The next day the bombing begins. One day we’re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin-Laden is public enemy number one, and U.S. jetfighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it’s on to a new enemy and new crisis.""

William J. Bennett, Host of Bill Bennett's Morning in America Show, is one of America 's most important, influential, and respected voices on cultural, political, and education issues. He has one of the strongest Christian world views of any writer in modern times.
 
What I See Happening In a Trump Presidency
By Bill Bennett
 
They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump.
 
Don't be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: 
Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.
 
It's about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media. They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it's in all of their interests to protect one another. It's one for all and all for one.
 
It's a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We're the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened.
 
Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart. It's no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It's because most of the other politicians are part of the a good old boys club. They talk big, but they won't change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations - like Big Pharmacy or Big Oil. Or they are owned lock, stock, and barrel by foreigners like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary and their Clinton Foundation donations.
 
These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money. 
 
But there's one man who isn't beholden to anyone There's one man who doesn't need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teacher's union, or the Service Employees International Union, or the Bar Association tofund his campaign.
 
Billionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn't need anyone's help. That means he doesn't care what the media says. He doesn't care what the corporate elites think. 
 
That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched interests. That makes Trump a huge threat to those people. Trump can ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slave masters.
 
Don't you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don't you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don't you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to de-fund Obamacare or Obama's clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right?
 
First, I'd guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything.
 
Ask former House Speaker Dennis Hastert about that. The government even knew he was withdrawing large sums of his own money from his own bank account. The NSA, the SEC, the IRS, and all the other three-letter government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They surveil everything. Thirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called racists, so they are scared to ever criticize Obama or call out his crimes, let alone demand his impeachment. Fourth, why rock the boat? After defeat or retirement, if you're a good old boy, you've got a $5 million-per-year lobbying job waiting. The big-money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose, they win.
 
But Trump doesn't play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice, cosy relationship between big government, big media, and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the Presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides but not Trump.
 
Remember: Trump is the guy who publicly questioned Obama's birth certificate. He questioned Obama's college records and how a mediocre student got into an Ivy League university. Now, he's doing something no Republican has the chutzpah to do. He's questioning our relationship with Mexico; he's questioning why the border is wide open; he's questioning why no wall has been built across the border; he's questioning if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in our best interests; he's questioning why so many illegal aliens commit violent crimes, yet are not deported; and he's questioning why our trade deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.
 
Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick. Good question! I'm certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama atforeign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion. Trump will ask if Obamacare's architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. Trump will investigate Obama's widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama's college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. How about the fraud committed by employees of the Labor Department when they made up dramatic job numbers in the last jobs report before the 2012 election?
 
Obama, the multinational corporations and the media need to stop Trump. They recognize this could get out of control. If left unchecked, telling the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Trump could wake a sleeping giant. Trump's election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at the cooked books and Obama's records, the game is over. The jig is up. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money. 
 
Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while Secretary of State, or for misplacing $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi . The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison. Obamacare will be de-funded and dismantled. Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters. Trump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved. That's why the dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.
 
Yes, it's become open season on Donald Trump. The left and the right are determined to attack his policies, harm his businesses, and, if possible, even keep him out of the coming debates. But they can't silence him. And they sure can't intimidate him. The more they try, the more the public will realize that he's the one telling the truth.",0,false,0,,,,,,

Lower those taxes though. Then put tariff taxes on imported goods. The amount would likely be aggregate to the value of their currency, and the amount of the trade deficit is with that country. So, for companies that have moved offshore, if they have a 30-40% tariff slapped on their item, instead of a $50000 dollar Mercedes, it'll be around 75-80k. Now, at first this seems unfair. However, when Ford decides to bring their plants back, because their pickups cost 50-55k, they'll be able to sell them again to the prime market for around 35-40k Every time premium tax items are purchased, it goes straight to public programs, and the deficit. Now, in regards to the military. We have been guarding our ally yes, but Japan since WW2. This is due to the Treaty. However, why should we have to guard them for life and go bankrupt. So basically what he wants to do is either pull it all together, or something I have personally tweeted to him is if it costs 500 million per year. Charge them 1.5 billion per year for protection. That way, we're paying off the deficit, and they can rebuild their military in tandem. For those that choose not to pay, it is their loss. But our gain. Now, the wall. We have 11 million undocumented immigrants here in America, and though many are good people, are here illegally, and we are a land of laws. If any one of us crossed their borders, we would be detained, jailed, and or sent back. PERIOD, end of story. So Trump's going to have Mexico pay for the wall, one way or another. If they don't pay him for the immigrants, it'll be a higher tariff. Problem solved. Chances are, he'll pass an executive order immediately anyway to fund it. This will get rid of the cartels, and the drugs not only coming from Mexico, but all of South America, and from around the world that import through Mexico, because of our weak border. We don't have to worry about our Ports, because they're strong, and Canadians don't want to leave Canada. They're currency is almost as strong as ours, and their quality of life is good. This is about protecting America, and making her great again. Plain and simple. In regards to Muslims. We have been unjustifiably bombing the living shit out of those countries for decades, because of the corruption in our political system. This is a halt until the shit is rinsed from Washington, and we can have some integrity. Once that happens, perhaps the Middle East will respect us enough to call of the Jihad. They are not nearly as poor as you think. They have gotten alot of money. 50 billion per year is our deficit to Mexico, they are NOT poor. The wall will cost 10 billion. They can afford 20% of their deficit to properly protect America. That's NOTHING to justify having access to our economy with a lower tariff, NOTHING. Then we have common core, what a fucking disaster bro. That piece of shit legislation is going to be tossed out, and education will be deemed by the states. More free market, more competition, and higher quality standards. Then you have institutions like the BLM and the EPA. Bureau of Land Management just basically got some ranchers arrested and killed. He's going to kill the BLM, and the EPA will take a hike too. You're telling me you can let Michigans water go to complete dogshit, and you can have 10s of thousands of fracking sites go unchecked, while they poison our people, and make our tectonic plates unstable? It's absolute treachery. I'm not saying Trump is a nice guy. I'm saying he is absolutely on the money, and sick of seeing these pathetic losers ruin America. Anyways, I sure hope this helps man.

A crucial distinction made in Islamic theology is that between dar al-harb and dar al-islam. To put it simply, dar al-harb (territory of war or chaos) is the name for the regions where Islam does not dominate, where divine will is not observed, and therefore where continuing strife is the norm. By contrast, dar al-islam (territory of peace) is the name for those territories where Islam does dominate, where submission to God is observed, and where peace and tranquility reign
More importantly, perhaps, is the fact that ""war"" is also descriptive of the relationship between dar al-harb and dar al-islam. Muslims are expected to bring God's word and God's will to all of humanity, by force if absolutely necessary, and attempts by the regions in dar al-harb to resist or fight back must be met with a similar amount of force. While the general condition of conflict between the two may stem from the Islamic mission to convert, specific instances of warfare are believed to be always due to the immoral and disordered nature of dar al-harb regions

After all, who does he think will do all that deporting?  The federal government colluding with the private prison system will of course.   Already, an estimated half of all undocumented aliens detained by ICE are housed in private prisons.  And they don't even always get it right and sometimes wrongfully imprison full US citizens for extended periods.  The most egregious case of that involved one US citizen named Hector Veloz who was detained by ICE for over a year, all the while Veloz did everything he could, including presenting his birth certificate to the immigration courts all to no avail.  One wonders, given Trump's notorious thin skin and huge ego, if he would make it so his worst critics would 'accidentally' be rounded up by ICE in Trump's massive deportation program?  For how many decades has Alex warned us that concentration camps are just around the corner while that has never happened.   The closest we have come is in ICE detention centers.   And for Trump's deportation plan to work on the sort of scale that would be necessary, the only way to do so would likely involve giant prison concentration camps that private prisons could operate and profit from and where political prisoners could easily be lost in all the confusion of such a huge operation.",0,false,0,,,,,,

since way before i ever heard of your show. Thanks to you i never took 
the swineflueshot, when almost everyone that did became sick. I`m from 
norway and i remember so well back then, the summer of 2009 that the 
swineflu-mania was one the front page every day in the largest 
newspaper, with the iconic pyramid/triangle as the symbol. My parents 
and everyone around me (except for a few) have told me that i am crazy, 
wrong or just dumb to believe the ""conspiracy-theories"" that revolves 
around 9/11, the illuminati or the NWO agenda. Well, i`ve now studied 
comparative politics for three years, getting in to the hardcore 
political structures around the worlds, as well as doing my daily 
routine of listening to your shows, or other research wich truly have 
taken up an enourmous amount of time, and i can tell you that nothing 
points me out in a different direction than where you`re going. Over the
 last couple of years i`ve started to reach a point where i don`t even 
feel like discussing theese topics with people, cause some are so 
unaware even though they know that`s something isn`t right, for sure, 
and there`s just to much information for me to pass on and it really 
shouln`t be coming for me in order to be considered as ""solid proof"" 
either. That`s why I only incourage everyone to do just a tiny bit of 
research (you really don`t need a lot to find validation in some of it )
 because after all these years that`s really the best argument of all. 
The research. It`s the only thing you need to do to find out the truth 
for your self.

I do not consider my self as a christian person as you Alex, nor do i 
limit myself to a certain religious belief, but we both know that there 
is a massive awakening going on in humanity. I have to say that the main
 difference from let`s say 5-6 years ago, from up until now That for my 
proves some of it is that don`t really  even have to defend or explain 
much around the topics of 9/11 / nwo, because people now seem to know. 
Even those who haven`t researched it would say : i wouldn`t be 
surprised. I`ve spent thousands of hours doing research on predictions 
of human awakening and the consciousness shift for mankind, from world 
leading guiding spirituals to far ancient predictions (like the mayans) 
and there is no doubt in my mind that there absolutely seemes to be a 
mass awakening going on - and the effect is that for the first time in a
 long, long time, we`re starting to see that we`re actually in controll.
 The Domino bricks will fall.  

I remember getting really depressed for a while there, listening to your
 shows and all the hopeless news, so i had to take a break from it, and 
this last summer (`15) it seemed like all the misery had no end. But i 
guess what they say is true about the night being at it`s darkest just 
before dawn, and i have to say that listening to your shows now, and 
just observing how confedent and optimistic you are sir - with all your 
true knowledge about what`s really going on right now- i have to say 
it`s truly inspiring. It`s just amazing and it fills my heart with joy 
and love. 

I think i could go on and on problably like forever but maybe one day 
i`ll write you a more personal letter, cause you probably wont see this,
 but i just wanted to thank you sir, for serving the good of humanity, 
for being so brave and for helping us to rise out of this pitfall that`s
 created by the globalist scumbags who only want to controll and destroy
 lifes in order to gain the most power. They will not succeed thanks to 
people like you, sir. 

Sincerely thanks, from Norway, with love

As for the multitude of ""facts"" that are pointed out on video by people who have posted informed proof on their channels, go watch some of the patterns of lies and deceptions that he uses on a regular basis. You will see and hear AJ being an intentional disruptor. There are countless videos available that you can easily go see by typing AJ is a shill, AJ exposed, or keywords along those lines. You'll see it for yourself. And look into the symbols he uses that you are not completely aware of. In the learly 2000's, I defended AJ the same way you are doing now. Only NOW I know damned good and well just how toxic he is to the REAL truth seekers. And fools like you go on supporting his ill intentions. Go ahead and be conned. But I warned you. It's not paranoia when you see it with your own open mind and can easily see what it is that he is ""really"" up to. Where do you think he gets the funding to present himself like he does. He says he's in Austin, but his InfoWars studio is in New York and is funded along with CNN. Yes, he can be very convincing. And most people do get fooled by him before they figure out that his inconsistencies are more revealing than anything else. Don't be so quick to fall for that. AJ is using the truth movement to further his own agenda. If you ignore that, then you will continue to go on being manipulated by what he says and does. AJ ""is""  Cointelpro. Research means looking at all available information both good and bad. Why does he not say anything bad about the Koch brothers, for a start?",0,false,0,,,,,,

I can name some policies and perks that Trump will bring that America NEEDS.

1. He will trade with other countries the correct way, he is a buisnessman, he has plans and are very certain of trades that will go to America's Favor.

2. He wants to kick out ILLEGAL immigrants, not legal, he has never said that he is against mexicans, only illegal people entering the country, doesn't matter what skin color they have, if they are illegal, they must go.
2.5: He even said, and I quote ""And I wouldn't mind having a HUGE door on that wall to allow legal Mexicans into America.

3: Like I said before, he is a buisness man, which means that he will know how to run America, and he knows how to handle economy, unlike your current president, which have made America worse than what it was before.

I agree that Trump is a talented business man and that he has money for self-funding his campaign, but would that be enough? I definitely would choose him before Clinton but none of them come even close to Sanders, and I do not understand why you would not agree.

Actually, I live in Sweden, and Sanders wants to implement a Scandinavian-like model. Many call Sanders for this with disgust a socialist, but I can´t tell but good things about living in Scandinavia. The only homeless here we have came from abroad, you can stay home with your new born kid for quite some time, and we have free education. Of course these are selfish things to talk about but Sander´s foreign policy is seems also much more rational and civlized than other´s.
Anyway, I do not see what your problem is with socialism!!!! (Socialism is political system characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production.) It´s for the people not for corporations or other group of interest.

Regarding the guns. I´m happy we do not have it here, but I see that you guys love your guns and I respect that. But still it seems quite irresponsible to sell guns like bread and milk. I definitely would not live in a place where people walk around with AK47s on their shoulders. Especially if it feels necessary.

They clearly state the building collapses at freefall for 8 stories, into itself, the path of greatest resistance.  This violates the laws of thermodynamics and conservation of momentum.  It's high school level physics.  For the building to crush itself, an external force, or energy, needs to be inserted into the calculation.  The building itself is not capable of crushing itself at the speed of gravitation.  It's so obvious that the mind refuses to accept it.  Magicians tricks are similar in effect",3

One of the photographs attributed to Arabs in Palestine was proven to be of a different time and a different context entirely.  
Further: 
Attorney General John Ashcroft released an israeli suspect in the September 11 terrorist events who ""had trouble"" with a seven-hour polygraph test administered by the FBI-but who ""did better on a second try."" The suspect still flunked both times. This remarkable admission appeared in the November 21 issue of The New York Times. In fact, the TImes reported, the suspect Paul Kurzberg ""refused on principle to divulge much about his role in the israeli army or subsequently working for people who may have had ties to israeli intelligence."" Yet, Ashcroft sent Kurzberg home to israel.

The Forward, a Jewish newspaper, reported on November 23 that ""top-ranking israeli diplomats"" had intervened with Ashcroft on behalf of Kurzberg and four other young israelis - evidently all former members of the israeli army - who had been taken into custody by the FBI in New Jersey after being seen acting suspiciously in the aftermath of The World Trade Center attack.

The Times said that witnesses had seen Kurzberg and his four colleagues ""going to unusual lengths to photograph the World Trade Center ruins"" and, significantly, ""making light of the situation"".",0,false,0,,,,,,

Here is number eight US Code 1182, inadmissible aliens. 
 
This law was written in 1952.  It was passed by a Democrat-controlled Congress, House and Senate, and signed by a Democrat president.
""Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by president.  Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, the president may, by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.""
 
All of the pundits that are claiming that what Trump said is dumb, stupid, reckless, dangerous, and/or unconstitutional, need to educate themselves.  It is already the law of the land.  And it was utilized by Jimmy Carter, no less, in 1979 to keep Iranians out of the United States, but he actually did more.  He made all Iranian students already here check in, and then he deported a bunch.  Seven thousand were found in violation of their visas, 15,000 Iranians were forced to leave the United States, 1979.
 
You probably won’t hear of this from the mainstream media (nor from our narcissist-in-chief), but those are the facts!
 
Maybe Trump isn’t that dumb after all?

We need no plan besides make a non profit insurance  available to all low in come . because of Obama care wont allow any one get more than 28 hours at most fast food places unless your a manager or supervisor...... you cant get hire on at plants because of the  cost. it cost so much to get hire on employees. its just easier to keep them as temps.  as staffing temp you cant get a loan. more problems is the  Cops all the time getting away with anything and every thing. create a law for the camera on the cop car live stream videos public access 24/7. this should stop everything and all of the harassment's that happen at every stop.  protect and serve. let them know who they work for.  push these  issue's and you will win by a land slide. make it easier to live. how? here  is how, make a government mandate to provide a solar panels to all low income family. why are we living just to make a payment before it gets cut off?    this will also cut your employment % more money poor has is the faster the planet will Grow . just think about it. the poor makes the rich feel richer  but what about being happy at the same time. people that do not stress get along with every one things are going good in their life then they smile. one smile will make another smile. then the change will began. give the low income family's a way out of abuse from the only 1 power, water, and gas comply that covers your area. they  able to add fees and know you cant fight them in court because lack of money.  give the power back to the people. why are we still voting the way we do its bull shit. im sorry but it is. we have technology to cast our own vote to be heard. make this happen.  On all laws and the vote for staff in  the white house office this would stop all hidden agendas and control over the people and also the one wins the vote......... no more congress no more mayors, and no one telling us what to do besides the vote. no more party's. ...this is the way to a peaceful life for all and a new way of life. we got to show the world how to lead.  Reinvent the USA in to the United Votes of the People.    give our voice wings so we may fly to a height that we never thought that could ever exist.   take back the Federal reserve and put it back in the hands of the government. why are we letting a Private bank get rich of of every one of us. that money could of gone back into the land and to people where it is needed. we already have the technology to do any thing  that we need to do. its time to apply it. so we the people will control our own lives. and we all will find peace in the world. i am hopeful of this world disappointing at times but it is filled with life. but right now what kind of life are we living is it worth keeping it going the way it has been. we  the people are  done with being cheated at every turn on the road of life. its time to make a difference and a change. one thing i know that has always been true  "" everything always change .  now is time for the change.",2,false,0,,,,,,

This is what you must understand if you're an angry libertarian or anarchist. Our endgame is TOO grand for the moment, this does not mean you should not fight for it, it means you must learn to be strategic and useful in order to reach it. Your desire to help (or rather to ""feel helpful"") must not surpass your capacity to seek the whole truth. Don't become so addicted to the dopamine release that you get when talking about the ideal free society that you lose sight of the nature of reality. The nature of reality is that human beings can be programmed (even if it's not always a conscious effort on the part of the parents) incredibly early-on. 90% of the brain and those deep grooves are developed by the age of FIVE. Your PREDISPOSITION to react to stimuli is very, very difficult to change if you are not taught self-awareness and critical thinking very early on. It can take years of consistent adult therapy to undo (or more accurately; to patch) tendencies which may have only taken weeks in childhood. This is much of why there will be no easy short term fix for Islam or the welfare-warfare state IF we enable it.

I get that it sucks to confront this and that it is uncomfortable. But we may literally not have the chance to bring about voluntaryism in the future if we allow the end of individualism and free speech in the west. That which mathematically cannot continue will not. The economic collapse here will most likely spell defeat for long-term peace in human civilization. This is not fear mongering, but a respect for the power of brainwash and modern weaponry.

Yeah, sometimes Donald Trump seems arrogant or doesn't speak with great poise, but he is hated by the media for a reason and is an ELECTABLE alternative  to the socialists (sorry Ron Paul, I fucking love you for bringing the light to me but you couldn't appeal to the neo-cons). The problem with statism is that you can never guarantee anything about what politicians say, even if they have a good track record / credentials and even if they seem honest. Politicians are professional actors of the non-Hollywood variety (except Obama, he seems to have had ample time to cameo in AAA films during his candidacy somehow), so if you would rather not vote there is no moral foul. Just don't forget Austrian econ theory when you look at Trump and his incentives for running.

TED is a good guy but I really and honestly don't see the difference between him and all the other conservative running... all of them have huge super pacs and all of them have been in this failed government that had led the country to hell. Sure Ted Cruz might have been on the side that was against it but he wasnt able to change anything, it's really all talk. Well that's just my opinion..

 I feel like we as Americans finally have an opportunity to elect someone who is honestly working for the people. TRUMP does not need to do this. He could be just relaxing with his kids with his billions of dollars but instead he wants to see america do good again.. I really Admire that.",3

I live in California, so Hillary will surely win in this state. Cruz is a very intelligent candidate who supports the constitution and rights of the individual. I don't think he has been bought out or if he has, he hides it well. If Trump wants to win this election, he needs to focus on specific issues and how he plans to change this country and that cannot be solely focused on criticizing the opposition or the current state of affairs. We all know how bad it is, what we need to here are specific plans that he would implement if he were in office, how he plans to work with other branches of government, and not making statements that are beyond his reach once in office. This is great for speechmaking, but not for governing. I do admire his position on most of the issues, what I don't see is his realistic plan of action.",0

Trump started off with specifics.. Illegal Immigration. Toughen up our boarders and build a wall! this is a must right now considering all the terror going on around the world. 

trump also addressed how we as a country are not being treated fairly and how horrible are trade deals are with other countries.. this is a huge problem because for the country to get better, we need to get rich again! who better to do that than a Business Man. 

not only has trump address the economic crisis, he also posed a plan. which was temporarily pausing muslim migration into the US until our vetting system is more effective. Cruz then came out with a similar plan but instead of saying muslims, he said specific areas where radical islam is present. but i find this wrong considering that the attacks done were committed by Muslims, sorry radical Muslims. there are innocent people who are not affiliated with this religion and don't deserve to be treated as one of them.

all I'm saying is that Cruz seems to be reacting instead of acting! Trump took so much heat on Illegal Immigration but stood his ground! and the same of the muslim plan. we need someone that is not tide on being PC.",5

At least you will get to rebuild your constitution and make america great again . She is not so great at the minute but there is change coming all across the world abundance is coming to the world and new tech to be rolled out. what we need to do is to increase our frequency and the frequency all across the world this will lift us out of this slump we are in. The world feels heavy and that is injustice rife throughout the world. ""ANYTHING WORTH DOING IS NEVER EASY"" and believe me i was give 2 hrs to live at one stage but i was given another chance and so im here with a bag of tricks.

The s-300(modern one) and s-400 can engage 80 targets at ounce at 600km which means it can engage 80 nuclear warheads at ounce. Which would buy China time to launch nukes during a preemptive strike.

You claim that America is the promised land, land of the free and the brave, but didn't they enslave the free Africans and genocide the brave Natives in order to build the USA?

You claim that you made the world better, offering businesses and development to 3rd world countries, but is that true?

Didn't all these poor countries have nice restaurants to be developed for better 'local' entrepreneurship, but are now forced to compete with McDonalds,KFC,Starbucks,Dunkin Donuts,etc on every street corner? 
Did Chiquita Banana not spray the entire South of America with DDT and other dangerous chemicals?

ISIS needs to be destroyed indeed, but you don't need Trump for that, you need to stop producing n distributing guns to Israel (who then sell it to any militant force on Earth - to achieve their divide n conquer mission).

Honestly, I trusted Alex a lot more in the early days when he was so raw and in everyone's face. I have a hard time believing that he hasn't sold out somehow - because I highly doubt that selling vitamins is going to net you a full on production studio with reporters, camera men, etc. Plus, there's that one little video of one of Alex's reporters being investigated by a cop - on seeing Alex's reporter's ID, the cop kept saying, ""So, you work for Time Warner?"" 
Now, perhaps that was a coincidence, or there's some other explanation, but right then I started to put 2 and 2 together.  Alex seemed to have been bought out. Heck, for a cool few million, I probably would have done the same. 
The question becomes, do we throw out the baby with the bath water? Is Alex still on our side? Is he trying to help us from a place of negotiating with the same elites that he so aptly criticizes? 
Honestly, this doesn't surprise me at all. I believe that it is highly possible that Time Warner did buy him out so that they could control his message and divert attention from the truth and the reality of 911 and many other staged events. Would Trump admit that Sandy Hook Elementary killings was a false flag? No way. Would Trump talk to us about the Bilderberg group, Bohemian Grove? Is Alex going to stop talking about that stuff too as if it never happened? 
Perhaps Trump does know about all of these things. Or perhaps he is simply a politician and knows how to slither his way between tough questions. I don't really know anymore. All I know is that all of us should have risen up a while ago and forcefully taken our country back - LIKE ICELAND!!! - We should have kicked all of the corrupt congressman out of office, arrested Bush for war crimes, and gotten someone in office who CANNOT be bought off. 
On second thought, that's exactly why all of us should probably just vote for Trump... sigh..",0,false,0,,,,,,

Both use a two headed eagle, which was also used by the Holy Roman emperors, which signified the partnership of Church and State. This of course is how the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic Church operated. And it is what both Putin and Trump are trying to establish.
Also of note is that the first use of the two headed eagle goes back to the Hittites, who were a pagan nation in constant conflict with the Hebrews and who God condemned. 
The two headed eagle was the Sumerian symbol for their god Ninurta, son of Enlil, with Ninurta being the god of hunting and WAR!! Did you get that?
The two headed eagle originally represented the pagan God of WAR. It was then later adopted as a symbol for the Holy Roman Empire, with is one of the beasts mentioned in both the books of Daniel and Revelation. And then today is used by both Russia and Trump.
Both Putin and Trump have their version of what a NWO will look like, with Christianity playing a major role as part of their vision, and both declaring Islam as their first target of choice to be destroyed. Putin and Trump have praised one another. And in both the USA and Russia a large portion of their respective populations see these 2 as bonifide saviors. This was also the case with Hitler, who had a good working relationship in the beginning with both the Catholic and Protestant Church. As there is a very real possibility that Trump may be elected President, it looks like the world's two major powers will be shaking hands and sitting down to hammer out the details of a NWO that will enforce some kind of Christian hybrid religion, with both men singing the praises of the other.",0,false,0,,,,,,

That is like saying that world war one started in 1907 when the triple entente was signed.
I don't very much like to use ww2 as example as that was petty much a guaranteed consequence of the Versailles treaty.
Nothing however is pushing the nations to war like they did back doing the prewar period.

We are in a cold war certainly, and America does constantly test Russias borders, but I think we are already starting to see a defusing of the situation in Syria, where USA is backing down, and giving concession to the Russian position of allowing Assad to stay, if the great power can handle that situation then I think the chances of war is very slim.
It can still happen of course, it always can, but at the end of the day cooler heads will prevail.
The USA will collapse like the sovjet union did, with a mass state secession movement.
They will start by losing their most independent minded states like Texas, followed by groups of other likeminded states.

Nothing can make America great again, and ye should stop trying to.
Just settle for good, it is much better to be a good country then a great country.
A good country is peaceful,
a good country is a nice place to live and
a good country have respect for its citizens personal liberty.

Here is how we can make America a good country by abandoning to be great.

1) Call the troops home, ALL the tropes, in fact disban the army, America does not need it, it only needs a coast guard and two small border guards to prevent trouble on the Mexican and Canadian border.
There would be no shortage of men volunteering to defend America if it were attacked, but if its not then the military is just a waste of resources.

2) Abandon the welfare, while there is nothing wrong with caring for the weak and the poor, this should not be a federal matter and we cannot afford it anyway.

3) Declare sovereign default to get a clean slate. It is obvious that the debt is unsalvageable so the best thing is to simple be honest about it NOW and start fresh.

4) Disband the FED and go back to the gold standard. The federal reserve have done nothing but mess up the economy for the benefit of the few, to serve the many we need sound money not paper and ink.

5) Change the federal electoral system to be more representative.
Each state should consist of only 1 electoral distract that each elect a plurality of congressmen, which will allow multiple parties, and minority representation.
The senators should be appointed by the states and not elected directly by the people and the states legislatures can at any time pass a motion of no confidence on their senators, which will force the senators to be loyal to their home state.
The electoral college of the presidential election should also be based on the principle of proportionalism, and the election should consist of two rounds like in France if no one candidate  can get more then 50% of the votes.
Finally we need a shift to a semipresidental republic, with a chancellor appointed directly by the congress acting as head of government, that will handle all the internal affairs of the government, confining the president to a more ceremonial role.

With these five initiatives I believe America could become a good nation, and it wouldn't matter so much who would be president.",4

The loses will only continue, its better to just raise the white flag and call a truce.
If American tropes stop looting their land, they will be much less inclined to seek vengeance in return.
A principle of non intervention and live and let live will allow the problems to solve itself.

If thou disagree with my five points please tell me what about them is misguided.

Also I did not say that we should not have any welfare, I said we should not have any federal welfare, what the individual state uses their money on is their own business, but it have to be fully funded.
For that we need to formally forbid any and all government institution from conducting deficit spending and mandate that all banks follow the principles of full reserve banking.

Thank you, I actually do not oppose public welfare, I just think it should be at the state level.
The Federal guardian was never meant to be anything but an impartial guardian for the most fundamental rights as laid out in the constitution.
The founding father never wanted interventionism neither internally nor externally. That is also why the army should be disbanded. There is no point in having a standing army while not at war and there is rarely a reason to go to war.
As I said, if Russia for instance decided they wanted to take Alaska back, there would be no shortage of men signing up to fight back. That is the litmus test to find out if a cause is just.
People never need to be forced to do what is good and right, even if it is dangerous. We saw that in Finland and Spain when people from all over Europe whet there on their own to fight for democracy and freedom.

we first need to define freedom, and then ask to whom it applies.
In general I would like to define it as the ability to do what we want to do, unencumbered by the will of others.
That however just leads it to become a zero sum game, the more freedom one person have, the less others have in return.
Absolutism is an extreme version of this, where one person, the king, is absolutely free, and is vested with absolute power, and all others are subject to his will.
What the founding fathers talked about however, was an idea sprung from the enlightenment movement in Europe, building on the ideas of such thinkers as Rousseau or Locke.
The idea of egalitarianism, that all men are created equal, and as such freedom should be equally distributed.
From this idea comes the non aggression principle. That it is wrong to initiate force, and impose thy will on others.
From this principle we deduce rights. Certain rights that are needed to further support the non aggression principle.
Rights such as
freedom of thought,
freedom of expression
freedom of labour
freedom of religion, and so on.
In short, freedom to do whatever we want, as long as it does not interfere with the freedom of others or violate the non aggression principle.

The idea and justification for the state was that certain aspect is handled better as a community then as an individual, and the state is legitimate only in so far as it reflect the will of the community.
As such the right to secede is also critical. The state exist only by the grace of its individual parts and only for as long as these parts desire it.
This right to secession does not go all the way down to the individual, as it is based on the idea of the community, but does go down to the smallest whole community.

Now it is obvious that the federal government of the united states violate both the rights of the states and of the individual citizen.
The first law of the social contract is that it is the state that must serve the people, not the other way around.

For the current political situation, it is clear to anyone that the USA does not need an army, Whether or not such an army is constitutional or not is irrelevant as that document is no longer in effect.
The USA is isolated by sea, and would need only a border guard large enough to deter its two land neighbours from attacking.
To send any troops off US soil is a violation of the non aggression principle regarding other people.

To paraphrase the US electoral system.
The purpose of the Republican party is to limit the freedom of foreign nations through wars of aggression.
The purpose of the Democratic party is to limit the liberties of the states and citizens of the USA and increase their dependence.",0

I am not so sure, I am quite positive in that there is nothing new under the sun.
The struggle of mankind, between patriot and tyrants does not change,
the fundamental desires of man such as life liberty and the pursuit of happiness does not change,
virtues are eternal, and the sins that tempted our forefathers temp us in equal measure today.
What have changed, what have truly changed.
I have studied history, I have seen the past, the rise and fall of Rome, ancient Israel and the struggle of kings and occasionally queens throughout what now know as the middle ages, and the quest for new horizons between that and our time.
Mankind haven't changed, our desires are as they have always been.
I have seen the likes of America in the past, so I know what its fate will be in the future.

It'd be a slaughter, there is a reason why soldiers undergo intense physical and mental exercises.

1) no one is going to attack another nation out of the blue, there is always a lot leading up to war.
2) No one can attack a trading partner, if two nations are heavily intertwined with trade both are dependent on each other which prevents attack.
3) America have in this century been engaged in multiple wars of aggressions against innocent nations who wanted northing more then to be left alone. We have seen the effect of these wars. Guerilla warfare have made the occupation very difficult, and USA is loosing control in many of its occupied areas despite its superior military force.
4)One cannot occupy a country forever, thou seem to be of the impression that IF a foreign power were to attack America, a notion that is beyond ridiculous even if it had no army, it would remain a conquered nation forever.
This is never the case, as the cost of occupation goes up over time thanks to attrition and increased resistance.
Sooner or later the foreign power would have to pull out, and a peace treaty declared.
The Franco-Prussian war of 1870 was an example of that.
The German army occupied Paris and Forced Napoleon III's resignation.
Their demand was territorial gains that they considered part of their nation and some war reparations in the form of gold franks.
After getting that they pulled out, and shortly thereafter the third francs republic was declared.
44 years later they were at war again and this time France won and took back what Germany had stolen with interests.

The way to protect a country is not with more government but with less.
All the power should be transferred to the people and smallest possible divisions.

If there is no head an enemy can cut off, then a nation cannot be conqured.

Yes we could imagine that say China sent a raiding team to New York to steal some of the city's riches and then quickly retreat to avoid the cost of prolonged occupation
But it would lose tremendous status internationally and no American would have anything to do with China for many years to come.
So they simply wouldn't bother and just prefer to keep good trade relation for the sake of business.
War is simply not profitable. Combatants never profits from fighting, only the middle men profits.
Middlemen like the German Rothschild
in the Napoleonic wars.
The same family that is one of many of its kind that have laid its greasy hand on the American monetary system and its military-industrial complex.

We have no one trained to use any equipment, we're fucked...unless you know some secret art our military doesn't know and you can make an effective soldier/pilot/crewman/officer in less than half a day.

2) Trading Partner??? Ok I want something you have and I have something you want...well wait a minute, you left the thing I want undefended...I'm going to take it then. I take you out of the equation I get all of what I want. You may be dependent on me but I am no longer dependent on you.

3) Nope nope nope...I won't lie innocents were caught in between...but our presence is very much needed and your argument that we're losing control is false...we pulled out thanks to obama and the area went to shit since the terrorists moved right back in...we had to start over from square one...thats why things are shitty currently.

4) Did you really just compare the 1870's to now in terms of logistical support...for real? After I even said you can't compare armies of old...logistics is a non-issue when you control the resources of the territory you are in but to humor you lets say the occupying force needs supplies and doesn't have them...they get on a radio and call it in. The supplies are flown and airdropped on their front doorstep...look at relief aid missions. Thats what they would be with nothing to worry about since we wouldn't have anything to shoot the planes down with. When an earthquake happens aid is almost instantaneously there with food, water, (ammo, fuel.)  

5) The Army isn't the Government...it serves it but if the government it serves becomes tyrannical it is its duty to remove said government.

6) There is no real head, you could say the President but there is a reason there is a chain of command, cut off one another instantly replaces it.

7) China wouldn't do that for such a low reward thing...whatever riches they recovered would be a dime in the bucket as far as China would be concerned. They would rather take an undefended nation over and take everything. Sure they'd lose face internationally but no one would do shit...a superpower just absorbed another superpower's resources...so the ranking would switch from all of those super powers to just being nations...they wouldn't be super compared to China/Russia.

8) War is profitable if done in the right way...acquiring another wealth of resources is definitely profitable.

It is very hard to offend me, and quite literally impossible unless thou know personal information about me.

1) there is always things leading up to war. The American's wars of aggressions in the 21st century were all to protect the petrodollar standard.
2) America is a decaying empire on the brink of collapse.
Like the Roman empire it was founded on a rebellion against a tyrannical king,
it was founded as a republic for the people, of the people by the people. But like the Roman poet Juvenal said:

""Already long ago, from when we sold our vote to no man, the People have abdicated our duties; for the People who once upon a time handed out military command, high civil office, legions — everything, now restrains itself and anxiously hopes for just two things: bread and circuses.""

The aggressively expanding army is one of the signs that always plays out in a dying empire. It becomes too hard to sustain.

Think about it, why isn't the world ruled by one king today? If conquering a nation was really so simple that occupying it would automatically grant one its full strength, then any power that gained traction, would only become stronger and stronger as it conquered more lands and one warlord would inevitably end up ruling the whole world.
It doesn't work like that, because a conquered region drains an empire for resources as much as it gains from it.
It is the same with business, revenue vs profit.
If a business focus only on revenue, it will overextend its resources leading to its collapse.
I have studied such businesses, seen many collapse from expanding too quickly.

USA have lost its production base that propelled it to superpower status after the war and have overexhausted its resources
And it is not about getting the supplies to the front line it is about having the supplies to send.

As I said in the beginning, America is done, the American century is OVER, and trying to fight fate, to become great again after it have been lost is the road to tyranny, the road Germany took.

And I don't think America can even survive a collapse, once the power of wall-street disappears, and the soldiers paychecks start bouncing, the orders from Washington will be ignored and it will be every state for itself.

Some states will be hit hard,
With few natural water sources and half the population on medication, California will experience an upheaval
Texas is one of the best prepared, and I believe will be the first to officially secede. That initiative will inspire others to follow.
There will be no second civil war as their will be no USA to start it and no army to fight it.

And trust me, no foreign power would want to touch that while all of this is going on, they will be too busy focusing on keeping their own countries together.
Because this economic collapse will be global, I hope thou art prepared.",0

Okay thou really need to practice thy vernacular. It is hard to understand thee.
But I get the general impression that thou dost not like the present governmental structure of the united states, especially regarding their debt to banks and the whole fiat currency system.
For this I would like to quote Napoleon Bonaparte:
“When a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes. Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain.”

So quite simply a government in the hands of banksters cannot represent the interest of the people. This can be solved with a few amendments.
1) Sound money, declare that only gold and silver can be used as currency, no paper or plastic substitute
2) Full reserve banking. Only allow full reserve banks to operate.
3) Debtless. Forbid all branches and levels of government creating debt.

People often talk about a balanced budget, but the key aspect is to prevent government debt. It is quite reasonable for the government to compound a reserve in good times, that can then be used when an extraordinary situation demands extra attention.
The greatest danger is the influence of banks, and that can be crippled by mandating that they only operate under the principle of full reserve.

I would like to end with another famoues quote from a former chairman of the bank of England lord Josiah Stamp
""Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The bankers own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to create money, and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again. However, take away from them the power to create money and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear, for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But, if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money.""",2

world war 2 started the 3th september 1939 when the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany, until that date there were only tension.
Tension doesn't necessarily lead to war, and in many cases the treat of war is enough to prevent it, is enough to make one of the powers back of.
Since FDR's decleration of war the 11th of December 1941 no official decleration of war have been issued by an American president, making every military action they have performed since world war two unconstitutional and a violation of common international practice of war.
However since wwii America have only fought unequal foes, a direct confrontation with a legitimate and equal great power like Russia cannot be pushed under the table as a police action.
A direct conflict between two great powers are the definition of a great or world war, and such a conflict cannot be pushed though as a police action.
Indeed such a conflict would result in the desolation of the united nation.

So in conclusion, tension is common, war is rare, it is going to be sorted out with diplomacy.",1

Wasn't just tension in Poland!  :)  I also wouldn't call the other countries being taken over by the Germans as just ""tension"" either, but I guess it would be hard to call war since there wasn't fighting.  But perhaps in retrospect people might consider it part of the war.  Also, some consider the fighting between the Japanese and Chinese earlier in the 1930s to be earlier phases of the war.  Then again, some consider WWII to just be a continuation of WWI.  So many different interpretations of events.

My friends consider the fighting of the last decade to be the early stages of a much bigger conflict in the future.  Hopefully you are correct that diplomacy will sort things out.",1

Well its not, because it can be resolved diplomatically, and then there won't be war, war is when diplomacy fails.
And what we have seen in the last decade regarding fighting is the USA's attempt to maintain the petrodollar standard. They have all been petrodollar-wars.

Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria they are all part of the same agenda, to maintain the petrodollar, and Iran have declared that they want to sell their oil in euroes so they have to be the next country to be invaded in the conflict.
The fact that USA have had to fight these wars is a sign of weakness, not strength. And I think that it was obvious for most people that these wars, especially the one in Iraq was all about oil.
Proof: look at how many times politicians denied that it was about oil.
When a politician denies something, we know its true.
If USA loses one of these wars, just one, the game is UP, the petrodollar will have failed, and the fact that so many countries have dared challenge it, and that the USA have been forced to intervene militarily proves their weakness.

USA is an empire in the last stages of collapse, I have seen the same signs many times throughout history, when an empire overextend its resources.
The collapse is going to be brutal and the USA cannot survive as a single political entity.

They can't win in Syria, so the system will really start to untangle there, not that this process didn't start 15 years ago, but it is going to accelerate and happen at the same time with a new major recession, or maybe a depression, one that the Keynesian cannot manipulate their way out of, because ""the long run, where we are all dead"" that Kaynes talked about is about to happen,the point where it can't be postponed any more.

The point where a century of short term, Keynesian delusions comes to a halt, and the economy have to reset.

The biggest problem I see is that a century of Keynesian madness have made us squander the Earths precious non renewable resources so it will be tough.

We can expect a significant decline in the general standard of living and a negative economic growth for many decades before we reach a new equilibrium.

I have calculated that this equilibrium is about 3 billion people.",0

No there have been great periods of prolonged peace.
From the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 and until the outbreak of world war one in 1914 the world knew a century of peace, with only few short outbreaks of minor wars.
World war one changed all that, it was truly the war to start all wars, and the reason was how it ended.
I made a map here http://rphb.deviantart.com/art/Brittania-rule-1812-591785463
about how the world could be different.

Had Britain won the war of 1814, they would have crippled USA's imperial ambitions. North America would have consisted of many nations in a power balance like Europe and there would not have been the great USA as a disturbing facto in WWI.
In this timeline with a very weakened USA WWI remains a European war and it ends in a draw.  This means that all the fighting were for neigh, and thus the people of the world loses all interest in future combat.
If the great war had ended in a draw, ended with white peace, no one would have ever wanted to start another.

For our world, the great destabilising factor is and have always been USA, that power have been the epicentre of all major conflict in the 20th and 21st century.
With its destruction, we will also see the end of  these constant wars.

What a load of shit!

Calling the 1800s a century of peace with just a few short outbreaks of minor wars is a joke to start with.  There were more conflicts in that time period your cited than years!  They include the Crimean War with nearly a million casualties, The Miao Rebellion with almost 5 million casualties, Taiping Rebellion with an estimated 20 to 30 million dead, Dungan Revolt with 8 to 20 million dead, US Civil War with around a million casualties (more Americans killed in it than all other wars combined), Franco-Prussian War with nearly a million casualties, Mexican Revolution with probably over a million dead, others with hundreds of thousands of deaths, and numerous others with tens of thousands of deaths.

The the BS of the US being the great destabilizer in the world.  The US didn't start WWI.  The US wasn't responsible for Communist revolution in Russia or the collapse of the Austrio-Hungarian Empire or the Ottoman Empire.  Was the US responsible for the rise of Hitler?  Did the US make Hitler attack Poland?  Did the US make the UK, etc. respond to that attack by declaring war?  And the list goes on.  The rest of the world is very capable of destabilizing themselves with out the US.",0

well yes there were some conflicts in the 19th century, but it was quite compared to what came before and after.
And regarding the 20th, the US ensured that WWI had no good outcome, without their meddling  a white peace would have been the most likely outcome,
and that would have ensured that
1) there would have been no communist revolution
2) the Austrian-Hungarian empire would not have collapsed
3) the Ottoman empire would not have collapsed
4) Hitler would not have been able to take power in Germany.

These things are a direct consequence of USA meddling.
Yes the fundamental evil here is imperialism, and it doesn't really matter which and how many empires there exist at any one time, every one of them, without exception are evil.

But the third wave imperialism under USA is if possible the worst, because never before have the sovereignty of nations been so completely disregarded, and suppressed under the idea of global hegemony.

As I said, no one will miss USA once it is gone, the people of America will be much happier, much freer, once they have become liberated and gained their independence from their imperial overlords in Washington.",0

See, you keep changing your story because you know it's BS.  Even your revised story is BS.  For example, there being no communist revolution.  The Tsar was already gone and Lennin already in Russia (thanks to help from Germany, not America, since you want to bring up ""meddling"") before American soldiers started arriving.  6 nations had more soldiers involved.  The US only supplied a little more than 10% of the allied forces, but the US is to blame?  Man, you are delusional.",0

If it hadn't been for the peace that forced the Germans from redrawing the white army would have been able to win the civil war and the result would have been more of a Franco like version of Russia.
Beyond that even if 10% is correct, that is still plenty to tip the scales.
But what was really terrible was the peace, with Wilsons 14 points.
Teddy would have done it a lot better.

Yes, I know that he would not have stayed neutral, he had no patience for that, he had gone all in from the beginning, and the result would have been a devastating defeat to Germany, and then a restoration period.
There would be no point in sending Lenin to Russia, the war would have been over before he could even arrive.

But I have a special kind of hatred for Wilson on other fronts, he was the father of the Federal Reserve and the IRS.

Somebody who will work with the other branches will be far more dangerous and continue current trends. Trump will be different, nobody disputes that, but there is no guarantee it will be better.

Thanks for explaining what an Autocrat is......
You claim nothing is inevitable before it happens, yet, you claim to somehow know Trump will create an Autocracy. Care to retract that statement? If nothing was inevitable, than why exactly do we have a word to describe the concept? LOL.
I do know history, very well in fact, WW3 is inevitable because until dangerous ideologies focused on world domination (Communism/Marxist Socialism, Radical Islamism, etc.) no longer have huge backings, that threat will always exist. If you look at the destabilization that led to the the other two world wars, they were inevitable. The increasing power of countries and ideologies combined with the fear and realization that reality requires action, and nature is amoral and respects survival of the fittest. Don't fight back, or allow another to gain too much power with an ideology of domination, and you will be conquered.
Look at Europe, sound like a good idea here in the US?

1) I said what an autocracy is because many people does not understand it, they merely think it means dictatorship, but dictatorship is to autocracy like what fingers are to a thumb.

2) I didn't say it was inevitable that Trump will become an autocrat, I said it is likely, based on the time, the circumstances and him personally.
Would that be better if this happened and all the vestiges of the constitution became null and void?
No, but it is better then what America is now, an oligarchy ruled by cronyism, corruption and greed.
The ideal would be a true democracy and personal liberty but freedom and democracy requires work and independent and critical thought, and all of these things are too hard in the land of the slaves and the home of the cowards.

If Trump don't gain powers I predict that we will see a total disintegration of the USA, a little like what we saw with the sovjet union.
Few in the 1980's believed that something like a sovjet collapse would ever happen, and many still feared a confrontation between the USSR and the USA as inevitable.

That's what I said, there are many way things could go down.
1) Trump gets the republican nomination => Trump wins the presidency
2) Trump is couped from the republican nomination = > Trump runs as an independent and wins the presidency
3) Obama calls a nationwide state of civil emergency and postpone the election, effectively continuing for a third term =>
Trump is installed as president after a march on Washington, forces Obama to flee.
4) Trump is assassinated and Hillary is elected president = > A massive popular uprising tears the nation apart and Washington is burned to the grown.

It's hard to imagine a scenario where Trump wont benefit.
They say he doesn't have a chance against Hillary, personally I don't think she have a chance against him, and the battle here is not about beating Hillary, it is about beating the Democrat-Republican establishment.

There haven't been true democracy in America for a long time, but with Trump it will finally be time to abandon all pretences.

I did not say that USA was not involved in warfare.
They have had many smaller wars since 2001 and before.
America is an empire, empires go to war, all the time, they need to in order to protect their imperial status, but it is not the same war, it is many different conflicts, and none of them are a great war, as a great (or world) war requires a direct conflict between two or more great powers.
The USA and the USSR never went to war with each other, they fought many proxy wars, but as they never engaged each other directly, there never was a state of war between them.
The great powers have not collided since world war two.
Presently the UN recognises five nations as great powers and gives these five nations special status as permanent members of the security council.
The primary purpose of the UN is to prevent a war between them, and IF such a conflict were to occur the UN would be forced to dissolve as it would have failed its mandate.

Just to make it clear. the present five great powers are:
USA, Russia, China, The United Kingdom, and France.

Now all the wars USA have fought since world war 2 have been illegal on two counts.

First they are against international law, as the UN charter forbid wars of aggression and they have in general ALL been wars of aggression.

Second, the US constitution demands that US troops can only engage in fighting if there is an official deceleration of war, that needs to be approved by congress and no such deceleration have been made since FDR declared war on Germany and Japan in 1941",0

The reason why empires die is because they are unsustainable, they want more then they are.
If humanity are to transcend this eternal struggle for empire and create paradise on Earth, we need to reject it.
We need to reject the principles of aggression and coercion, and allow everyone else, to live their own lives, and make their own mistake.

The principle of non aggression and autonomy are quite simple, no one have the right to interfere in the action of anyone else's life, as long as these actions does not hurt a third person.",0

And if you think that a new president is even going to come close to fixing the mess we're in right now, I'm sorry but you are mistaken.

For Trump money doesn't matter. This whole thing for him, and the people really in charge (the one's pulling the strings for nearly a century), it has nothing to do with money, but POWER is the real goal, and of course with power you get money, but we all must understand the big boys don't care about money, it's power and control.

 Not to mention if Trump is nominated and goes against either Hilary or Sanders, it doesn't matter which, he will lose hands down. Which is really why I think he's there in the first place.

This is true,  all religions are allowed to be here, practice worship.  That is separate from my own belief that Islam is a present danger to democracy.  There are moderate muslims addressing this problem. They see it as  I do, that they are invasive, they wish to conquer by sheer numbers. Isis claims their goal is not just an Islamic state. They want to go globally. How do you do that with their army> scatter all muslims around the world in large numbers.
Demand sharia in every area. Isolate yourselves from the poplace, then grow, grow and grow. The cancer cell does the same thing. Oh this could not happen here? It is happening here, and it will be more evident in five years.

Do you know anything about America's brutal labor history?  Capitalism has always been a system that protects privilege.  This is what private property laws have always been about.

America's history of expansionism goes way back.  For very logical reasons. 

As America was producing more than demand as industrialization increased production, the 'tendency of the rate of profit to fall' as Marx put it took effect, leading to unemployment and repeated depressions. The answer to the over supply problem, expansionism. 

""A new consciousness seems to have come over us; the consciousness of strength; and with it a new appetite, the yearning to show our strength. . . . Ambition, interests, land hunger, pride, the mere joy of fighting, whatever it may be, we are animated by a new sensation. We are face to face with a strange destiny. The taste of Empire is in the mouth of the people even as the taste of blood in the jungle. . . . "" - Washington Post editorial on the eve of the Spanish-American war

Even by the 1890's America had much experience in overseas probes and interventions. The ideology of expansionism was widespread in the upper circles of military men, politicians, businessmen, and even among some leaders of farming' movements that new foreign markets would help them. 

Captain A. T. Mahan of the U.S. navy, a popular propagandist for expansion, greatly influenced Theodore Roosevelt and other American leaders. He preached that the biggest navies would inherit the earth, and that ""America must now begin to look outward"". 

A State Department list, ""Instances of the United States Armed Forces Abroad 1798-1945"", presented by Security of State Dean Rusk to the Senate committee in 1962 to cite precedents for the use of force against Cuba, shows 103 interventions in the affairs of other countries between 1798-1895. Here is a sampling of the list, with the exact description given by the State Department:

1852-53-Argentina - Marines were landed and maintained in Buenos Aires to protect American interests during a revolution. 

1883-Nicaragua - to protect American lives and interests during political disturbances. 

1853-54-Japan - The ""Opening of Japan"" and the Perry Expedition. [The State Department does not give more details, but this involved the use of warships to force Japan to open its ports to the United States.]

1853-54-Ryukyu and Bonin Islands - Commodore Perry on three visits before going to Japan and while waiting for a reply from Japan made a naval demonstration, landing marines twice, and secured a coaling  concession from the ruler of Nada on Okinawa. He also demonstrated in the Borin Islands. All to secure facilities for commerce. 
1854-Nicaragua - San Juan del Norte [Greytown was destroyed to avenge an insult to the American Minister to Nicaragua.]

1855-Uruguay - U.S and European naval forces landed to protect American interests during an attempted revolution in Montevideo. 

1859-China - For the purposes of American interests in Shanghai. 

1860-Angolo, Portuguese West Africa - To protect American lives and property at Kissembo when the natives became troublesome.

1893-Hawaii - Ostensibly to protect American lives and property; actually to promote a provisional government under Sanford B. Dole. This action was disavowed by the United States. 

1894-Nicaragua - To protect American interests at Bluefields following a revolution.

Between the Civil War and 1900, steam and electricity replaced human muscle, iron replaced wood, and steel replaced iron (before the Bessemer process, iron was hardened into steel at the rate of 3 to 5 tons a day; now the same amount could be processed in 15 minutes).  Machines could now drive steel tools.  Oil could lubricate machines and light factories.   Andrew Carnegie (Steel), Jay Gould (Rail Roads), John D. Rockefeller (Oil), and J.P. Morgan (Banking and head of great industry) and co. formed a tight little alliance.  They made fortunes of the backs of American labor. 

When Frederick W. Taylor created a system of finely detailed division of labor, increased mechanization, and piecework wage systems, he increased production and  profits.

Despite already enjoying massive profits, Carnegie decided to reduce wages and break up the union, he built a fence 3 miles long and 12 feet high around the steelworks and topped it with barbed wire, adding peepholes for rifles.  When the workers did not except the pay cut he laid off the entire work force and brought it strike-breakers.  The Pinkerton detective agency was hired to protect strikebreakers.  

Prison labor and foreign speaking immigrants were often used as strikebreakers.  

""I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half.""  -  Jay Gould.",0

Why else do you think the Bill of Rights is a separate document.

It is true that Hitler wasn't the only Nationalist. The Japanese government between approximately 1936 and 1945 was also Nationalist. The latter part of the Mussolini regime was also Nationalist.

Nationalism runs on myth, not reality and definitely not history.  It also runs on an enormous amount of idolization of the nation and hatred of people who are not a certain kind of  native to the nation in question.

But national defense is cheap.. America actual doesn't spend that much money on the military if you base it off of percentage of GDP.

But look at all other whistleblowers and guys who did or said or knew far less have been taking out by them. Alex is allowed to go and try to wake us up but it's Antichrist the devil who comes as a Savior or helper. No bro what woke me up to Alex not being legit was him appearing on that moron Piers Morgan show on live TV. Now what did he go do he went nuts on a bunch of shit that made all of us who know about 9/11,  Benghazi, all the false flag events that have happen and made us look like crazy ass conspiracy theorists or now what they call us truthers. Instead of making valid points like Jesse Ventura who they are afraid of and banned him from TVwhy cuz he does not have to raise his voice cuz he just kills you with facts. Jesse can not lose a debate against anybody and without a script just all off his head he will tear them all apart. All he needs is 2 or 3 Debates and come in late this year and he could win. Look at Alex he made a fool out of himself on TV and made all those who seek the truth look stupid which he was sent out to do. On top the other thing was the break in Documentary on Bohemian Grove which if you really look into it closely you can tell he is in with them and take the truth but make it absolutely pathetic so it's not taking serious and the Gov can't be that dangerous they could never be involved in kidnap, killing, sacrifice, drug trafficking, sex slaves and many more. In the video which has been a couple of years since city saw it but you can tell he is hiding certain shit that would clearly show he works for them. When and how he breaks into a place like that you don't think the security would be impossible on top when he is already known and arrested come on. Then he says when it's showing the sacrifice and what they do with real bodies he says I found out they had camera's all over because we were asked by security who we were and what we were doing there. But does not explain how he got out of it and better yet why not release the Convo cuz he has it on tape. Then he says they were deep in a wooded area so to stay out of sight after security was already on to them and says they were caught again and asked questions for almost an hour and says thank God we had the camera audio still recording. Now he just tells us but never shows us or let's us hear any of it and that is clearly a RED FLAG. And remember this guy is a Millionaire yes people go see how much he makes off people dude there's know 2 ways about it he is a fraud. Now look at his shows please it's 90% commercial advertisements to buy all this crap he is selling. Dude it's a ploy all he is doing is making money $$$$$. And he is against Rep & Dem but his favorite President was Reagan and here he is supporting the Republican Trump which Alex knows Democratic or Republican your a puppet dude your owned and run by the ones who run this country.

I will say this if Donald Trump wins and he gets in there and nothing gets better the same bullshit goes on . then we have our clarification that there is only one way we will ever get change is to bare arms with our military. and all Americans will jump on board    and take them down and through them all in Jail  .

Supporting him doesn't mean we agree with absolutely  everything he says, but rather if he wins this would actually be a win on the right path. Instead of supporting candidates that end up on the very bottom of the polls being crushed by a single media outcry and have no way to fight back. 

Trump has gone absolutely far against the storm, every single time he says something the media twists him and the dumb believe it. He has been the most honest, straightforward, non-racist candidate out there, and the media has twisted him so much it's really sad. If Trump doesn't win, the elections might as well not take place from now on. The media will decide who will win.",2

"" I want it all and i want it now!""  and off they go on an unsustainable diet and military boot camp regime that results in injuries a distaste for the whole thing and sometime permanent extra damage and distrust of getting up and trying again. 
what is needed is a careful measured long term approach that considers the potential untapped spending power of the 90% if you only just got those rents and mortgages down to a sane and just level vs the minimum full time wage.

You must be liberal, considering your massive amount of stupidity concerning mass shootings and a terrorist organization.

First of all, mass shootings account for less than 1% of overall crime, and are mainly done by people on DRUGS, except for the last 2 incidents of mass shootings, which were done by TERRORISTS.

People are being radicalized via the internet due to these people, and muslims and liberals were just recently calling for the assassination of Trump, so the bad is self-explanatory there concerning them.

Nobody wants a politician in office anymore, people want individuals that are outside of the system, whether it be Trump or Carson or Jesse Ventura, it doesn't matter.

Whoever is allowed to be elected into office will be working for and payed for by the powers that be, and will do their bidding just like all the other ones.

Bushy Boy had been convinced by a cabal of upper-level neo-conservatives (Wolfowitz and his friends, smart guys but absolutely no sense of what the world is really like) that Saddam Hussein was responsible for all the problems in the Middle East. Bushy Boy really wanted a war anyway, so that he could be a ""war president"" like Roosevelt, et al. THIS was the main cause of the United States invading a country that had not harmed us in any way, in fact was already being greatly harmed (the sanctions that made food scarce and caused so much illness and death among babies).  Despicable. The oil was a big factor, especially since the U.S. public was told that the Iraqi oil would pay for the war, but it was not the major factor that led to the war. The overweening ambition of a few men in high places caused us to do such an awful thing.

He is revealing how stupid the current people are who run things and I bet next year we won't have a  man/girl for the whatever of the year.  I;m sure the politicians surely know what he is saying they just don't deal with anything, and we will be no more, unless someone does. Then Hillary says love will do this. She is out in la la land this is real and deadly but we already know how she handles real and deadly. .....Finally a voice for the Silent moral majority and he is doing this because he feels just like we do, not to impress anyone and the best part is he can... Tell me anyone else who could at this point?  He talks about money so we will know he means what he says, not to show off. When I heard him tell us what he will do, the anger I have had at what has happened the last 20 yrs was gone, just that fast. I smiled and knew finally we had our man.  Mind you I am no spring chicken, I am 69 years old and do know what i am talking about.   Just with my wisdom,  and I am smart, not rich but smart lol and, I know who  we don't need to run this country and it is ""anyone else""  

 Remember, to the rest of the world we are the immoral infidels. When we go  anywhere, people think, ""oh no now we are gonna die"" and we strut like aren't we the nice guy for jumping in another mans war and we have no business taking care of anyone but ourselves. I could go on and on with examples but there isn't enough room here. I never knew there were this many people who don't see what is really going on?   I went to jr college for a couple of years and am no rocket scientist so something is wrong somewhere  Why would we want a mediocre person or someone who has let our men die and has email  everywhere. The corker is that she is even allowed to run for president and should be in jail. Anyone else would be. This man is tired of them knocking his intelligence and so are we, we just never had a voice. This is where ""Freedom of speech"" is a joke unless someone can hear you. FINALLY  we have a megaphone that they will listen to and I can't think of anyone better to do the job.  We have to stop sounding so stupid, because we have sure made a mess of things because of stupid opinions.  The next time someone complains about what  America should do to please them. We should give them ear plugs and tell them to go home.  Remember the enemy has never been on our soil before and worse than that there is no country or uniform to know them.  When they could be our next door neighbor this is the only man with enough brains to do what he can to make this better.  He is no saint and we know his skeletons....I for one have been angry that they have knocked our intelligence for years, and this is like a breath of fresh air. This is real, we were dumb enough to arm the world, and this man knows this is not something to talk about and discuss. He will do something finally so if we are smart we will get behind him 100% or we won't be free much longer. Anyone who is not on board with this man is going to be the reason those people will be our next door neighbors, and that won't happen with a smart man running things.  I am not on his bandwagon per say, but he is right absolutely right. We are lucky he even wants to do this because he sure doesn't have to.  The media is as bad as the terrorists if we aren't careful.  Programmed by their opinions only it didn't work with me. Let Donald pick the hero next year.  That was the downfall of the media finally.  Brucie may be a very nice boy/girl but definately not ""woman of the year"" and no, we did not pick that one, the ,media did and everyone knows that. Myself, I am loving it and loving all those people finally being put in their place. Hillary can spread her love in jail. I would already be in prison as would anyone else if we did what she has done. Who is going to make this country great again? No one out there right now and I know this, and so should everyone else. Playing dumb only shows us how stupid people are. Trust the one who has the way and forget what you think, opinions only reveal the worst not the smartest.  I will never meet Donald Trump and that is not my goal. I just want to see him do what he says because he loves this country and I don't see or hear anyone else who does.  I don't even have to join his fan club and I mean this. Besides he is a good father and I love his wife. He won't turn on this country and that is a fact.    I remember I liked Ross Perot and this is even better. But we need it now not later.  That is my rant for the year. But I mean every word.

While I appreciate your passion for spreading liberty Alex, you can't have your cake and eat it too. Ron Paul has been speaking out throughout Trump's entire presidential campaign about how authoritarian and anti-freedom Trump's platform is. In contrast, you are supporting and agreeing with a lot of Trump's policies. You barely even asked him any tough questions. The best question you asked on this set is ""what do you think of libertarianism?"" Trump self-identifies as being the most ""militaristic candidate,"" but is yet sympathetic toward libertarianism? Like I said, you can't have your cake and eat it too. It seems ridiculous that you would have Dr. Paul on your program on numerous occasions and agree with everything he says, but then you also have Trump come on and tell him that you agree with a lot of what he is saying. On most of the issues, Ron Paul and Donald Trump are opposed to each other, so how are you going to agree with both of them simultaneously? There is only one side that can be chosen here: liberty without compromise (individualism) or some statist paleoconservative compromise of limiting liberty in the name of nationalism and American exceptionalism (collectivism). You can't have both without a contradiction in terms. I know that you mean well, but intentions are not everything. Please think about this.

I can explain to you how virtually all politicians are puppets, but considering you don't acknowledge that, I won't waste my time with it all.

Obama is controlled by the insurance companies, hence why his pathetic obamacare program is so popular among them, they profited hundreds of millions of dollars off of it.

He is inclined to do favors to his donors, whether it's oil companies, insurance companies, whatever.

So hence, the puppet master as you call Trump, is very, very popular for many reasons, including that one. He owes nobody nothing, he bought off many politicians, and he knows the game and wishes to put a stop to it as well.",0

Uuhh, how much do you know about Jesuits in the last twenty-thirty years? Do you know ANYTHING about Jesuits in the last 100 years, or from the time Ignatius started the group? There were times when the Jesuits were not guys you would want around, but bad in 1750 or so is not necessarily bad in 2100. These guys always were very smart (except for a few - even Harvard has some numskulls ; George W. Bush in their Business School is an example), and for quite a few decades now, they have also been doing the right things. They really are on the side of the poor, sometimes at risk of their lives because  they side with the poor.  Remember the massacre  of six Jesuits, their housekeeper, and the housekeeper's daughter in El Salvador in 1989. And remember that the current pope, Francis, is a Jesuit.
     This is hardly the way Donald Trump runs his life. No vow of poverty for him, nor any vow of chastity. He's on wife #3 and, I'll bet, still counting. Even more to the point, he preaches hatred against  groups of people he doesn't like, even though he knows nothing about the groups he's denigrating. But I do see that you don't like Trump either.

There are still many other groups and resistance movements which have the same goal and they are trying anything to liberate the earth and the termination of the old regime with the help of the positive ETs.
These so called Cabal pull the strings in the background and directs the destinies for a very, very long time on earth. They are responsible for so many wars, false flags, injustice, pollution, animal torture, sorrow and pain. Also this society resp. this system in which we live with the ways of thinking, values, precepts, procedures was only created by the negative forces through invented religious dogmas, the financial system, the governments, the military, the mainstream media (TV-news, print media and so on) to control, manipulate, indoctrinate us for their own purpose and benefits.
They deceive us an illusory liberty and choice which was or is never true liberty. We were never free because we are all slaves, slaves of the regime. We already were born in the slavery and that finally have to become clear to mankind. They certainly are trying to disguise with all means the truth to keep us away of this as much as possible to secure their retention of power. However in the long run they will not succeed.
You have to free your mind from this ""prison of the mind"" and learn to see and understand what is really going on behind the scenes resp. behind the familiar reality of everyday life. Because in this way you may realise the truth beyond the illusion and we can raise common and change the world.

How are we going to keep the terrorists at bay without changing the constitution at least a little? We are saving ourselves if we do the ""no Islam entering"" policy. (I don't call it the ""Anti-Muslim policy"" or whatever it's called, because that's not at all what it's about, it's about keeping them out so that they can't harm us.) 

Sure, these recruits are going to be able to slip through the cracks, but the results won't be as deadly as just letting them enter and go about willy-nilly. Every other country is closing their borders to ISIS, why shouldn't we? Right, the Constitution. Well, other countries have things similar to the Constitution, and they aren't complaining about it. Open your eyes, please. Trump is the easiest way out.

Also, to all who say he's racist, check the numbers on which ethnicities he employs under his company. He even employs, check this, MUSLIMS! Le gasp but that couldn't be right! He's a racist swine! No, of course not. If he was racist, he would be doing MUCH worse than just this. 

I just want to say this, Rise, you seem like a good person with good views on things like this with - at the very least - semi-open eyes. Open them wider, and you'll see. Don't listen to media, they lie. I was at one of his rallies and he referenced the media that was there, accusing them of lying. He was right. One man, anti-Trump, protested about ten minutes into the rally. This one man turned to a group, and they were all escorted out, politely, then forcefully when they made a scene. 

The next day, after the rally, the news read with the headline, ""*PROTESTERS BEATEN AND THROWN OUT AT TRUMP RALLY*"" which was a blatant lie as my father, my mother and my sister were all there, watching the protesters being calmly escorted before THEY started attacking the people pushing them out. Well, not attacking in the physical sense, but it certainly was verbal. Nonetheless, the people throwing them out held their own and continued, but never attacked them.Now, Rise and everyone else, let me say this, I am not attempting to change your views or try to come off as some racist pig. I'm only a fifteen, going on sixteen year old boy. I have my views, you have yours, and we can debate them as adults, but I would prefer not to resort to laughable internet tactics such as ""LOL ur gay kill urself faggot"" or ""You're opinions such, and frankly, I hate you."" (Yes, I used the wrong ""you're"" in that sentence, it was supposed to be there.)

But just know that because I'm not a Trump supporter doesn't mean I'm a supporter of anyone else! If I was, I would tell you and stick by my beliefs. But I happen to NOT be a Republican, a Democrat, or anything else but a Constitutionalist. I do lean more conservative, I believe in the 2nd amendment and believe we SHOULD all carry a gun as our founding Fathers warned us to. They told us that if we ""give up our security for safety, WE DESERVE NEITHER"". You see, they knew the potential hazard of what could happen if our govt ever took our capability to defend ourselves. That includes changing our Constitution. Even IF we had a completely sane and benevolent govt, we still would not want to take the chance of changing our foundation, our Constitution, because that leaves the door open in case the govt then changes. But history proves that the govt is in fact quite the opposite of being trustworthy. So yes, I'm VERY awake to current happenings, and have been for the last decade in which I've had to make up for all my "" stupid years"". God Almighty has also blessed me with discernment and I pray for wisdom every day. I honestly don't feel it matters who we vote for as it's all rigged anyway. They already have their next puppet lined up, and this is how it's always been. And just for the record, I'm completely in line with Juan Angel in that the only candidate I can remember voting for in recent history was Ron Paul. I also think there's a good chance that our Lord will come for His church before next election as things get even crazier and deceptions get greater. I pray everyone uses discernment, prays for wisdom, and stays in the Word in these last days. Do NOT go by what someone says, but by their fruits.

I also know what is prophecied to come. I've known all my life. I also must say you need to choose whether you're calling your side either the dark side or the light side, you can't have both (see previous). 

For we know what Satan truly is as God tells us: ""And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light"" - 2 Corinthians 11:14 (ESV). Jesus tells us HE is the Light: ""I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me, may not remain in darkness."" - John 12:36 (ESV).

So how can we make sure we're on the right path and following the right light?

Psalms 119:
Verse 105
“Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path”
and 
Verse 130
“The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple”

To read more, here's the article I pulled from. Of course, there's always God's Word: http://www.gotquestions.org/angel-of-light.html

I truly hope you come to know the Truth. I really mean that. Sounds like you've been lied to for quite some time. This is a war. For our very souls. And I personally don't plan on spending eternity burning in a lake of fire for turning my back on a God that did nothing but love me. And even died a brutal death for me. When he did NOTHING wrong. Did your god do that for you? . . . . . .",0

It was a group of local big-wigs who determined to stop any kind of integration anywhere in the South and in some border states. In some ways they were harder to fight than the KKK because they were the local ""leaders."" They considerably slowed down a great many integration efforts, prolonging Jim Crow and trying (sometimes successfully) to dismantle public education. Many of the groups were responsible for the establishment of white-only schools often run by white Evangelical preachers and funded by the state government. (Those of us advocating for integration in schools and the demise of Jim Crow sometimes called them ""seg academies"" - segregation academies).  The White Citizens' Council or Citizens' Council in some places eventually lost their battle. Ron Paul was a supporter of this group, and possibly a member. He often spoke to the various Councils, and otherwise associated with the members. After the 60s and early 70s  when things calmed  down, the Council lost members and decided to change its name to the Conservative Citizens' Council (their publication is on-line, with the name American Renaissance - it's a white supremacist site). The Council is still around, and both Ron Paul and his son Rand Paul continue to give speeches to the group and to hob-nob with the members. Do you really want someone like that as your president?

COULD SOME OF THE MEDIA  HAVE FALLEN INTO A TRAP??  WE HAVE NO OTHER  CANDIDATE RUNNING THAT CAN COME CLOSE TO DOING WHAT DONALD TRUMP WILL DO FOR THIS COUNTRY.  HE WILL BE THE BEST COMMUNICATOR WITH THE LEADERS OF OTHER NATIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD IN MANY YEARS.   HE WILL NEGOTIATE  FAIRLY   WITH EVERYONE.  HE WILL BUILD RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES  INSTEAD  OF MAKING  ENEMIES AND DESTROYING THEIR COUNTRIES .  AMERICAN  PEOPLE , DON'T LET  THESE  "" BUSY BODIES "" TWIST WORDS   . DONALD TRUMP  WILL BE HARD TO BE FOOLED BY PEOPLE LIKE ERDOGAN IN TURKEY  OR  THE SAUDI'S , OR THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD.  , BUT HE IS SMART ENOUGH TO OUTSMART THEM . , AND HE WILL NOT TAKE CRAP OFF IRAN..  HE WILL NOT SUPPORT AND FUND ISIS , ISIL. HE WILL KILL THEM  !!    HE WILL DESTROY THE TERRORIST . HE WILL DO IT BY LETTING THE QUALIFIED MILITARY AND HIMSELF WORK OUT STRATEGY  . HE IS VERY INTELLIGENT  IN BUSINESS  . HE IS NOT A KILLER. MURDERER , OR MAFIA PERSON  ,  AND HE IS LOYAL TO HIS COUNTRY   ,.

Which is the radicalization of the Western World and implementation of Sharia Law in America. Nobody is willing to address this properly and you surely will realize this when sharia patrols start in your area as they have in Paris, Great Britain, and even Detroit has issues now. Mathematically and statistically they are set to take over by 2030 unless intervention is made. The reason the spread of radicalization is so prominent is because they are raised that they must raise their children to believe these ideas and that if they leave the religion they will either be killed under sharia or they will burn forever and be punished. They are also told to have many wives and produce many children and also take the wives of Westerners as ""War Booty"" and spread their seed into the civilization. People should be allowed to believe what like, but they cannot contradict human rights by hurting people and imposing ridiculous laws and false punishments and infiltrating society. Their main mechanism of defense is calling people on criticism and saying its racist. When in their fully implemented societies you would be killed for such ""Blasphemy"". Already in some parts of the world the media has been banned from criticizing these ideas. I know you as a successful business owner and self made person could understand this as well. THINK, and be prepared. Its coming and its openly proclaimed, it will be swept under the rug until its too late if Trump is not taking care of it.

     Another matter: you seem to assume you know what is in the mind of God (an extremely presumptuous assumption). Do you REALLY know that Christianity is the only religion that's real? THINK about it. There are several very large religions in this world. They've been here for centuries, some even for millenia. If this is a world with a god who is all-powerful and  supports only Christianity, why are those other religions still here. Surely God would have been powerful enough to get rid of those other religions if the only religion he shines his light upon is Christianity. You may be flirting with going to hell, as you said about all liberals, yourself. And God may well  find all this nation-worship a form of idolatry, which He despises.

But should we not, then the politician with the most votes to ""relive"" in that community would win. It's an experiment I think could shape not only our nation as a whole, but our political parties outlook on their way of ""running"" this nation all together. So long story short....

A couple of issues that I agree on; Alex lobbed softballs instead of asking some tough questions.  All the Alex supporters I know are convinced that 9/11 was an inside job.  I will not venture to make specific accusations but I am convinced the buildings were wired for controlled demolition.   If that is true then the official story is bogus.  Alex completely skirted the issue instead of asking Donald directly about it.  I think this was a calculated move on his part.  Donald may be the biggest profile guest Alex has ever had.  The topic is simply too controversial and any politician knows not to touch it with a 10 ft poll.  Alex steered clear of any such controversy for this interview.  I would have like to see him probe about Donald's stance on the Patriot Act, and half a dozen other criminal legislations that came about after 9/11.  Despite not asking the questions that I would really love to hear Donald address I understand why he didn't.

Others are attacking Donald.  Again, I get it.  The guy is controversial and egotistical.  He is also tough as nails and smarter then any presidential candidate we have had in years.  If he is not the guy to turn things around then this country is fucked because there is not a single candidate in the field that can pull us out of the mess we are in.  Nobody is bold enough to make the tough decisions except for Trump.  Clinton is just in love with power and would be useless as president.  Sanders has good intentions but his socialist agenda would put the final nails in the coffin of this terrible economy.  Donald is the only one proposing solutions.  Bash him all you want, the rest of the field completely sucks.  I will take egotistical and competent over corrupt and self-serving or totally ignorant any day.",0,false,0,,,,,,

Think about it. Why was it formed 600 years after Christ and 1000 years after the Torah? You can believe in the pasta monster from outer space if you want, it doesn't bother me, and your free to do so, however, I'm bringing up facts you SHOULD certainly look into. There is also a reason for the lineage of generations in the Torah/Bible. The same lineage Moses was given. Do you know why? It is a witness to Jesus's bloodline. I recommend you look into it.

He keeps making all of these sensational claims, but he never says how he's going to manage doing all of that, like if you ask most politicians they will go into a minor explanation of plans that they have in place, like Bernie Sanders tax plan and Immigration plan on his web page. If you go to Trumps page you have some very vague tax plans that talk about lowing minimum wage which is against 90% of Americans interests to have a lower minimum wage and his HORRIBLE immigration plan that makes me sick to my stomach to read it. There just aren't any explanations in DETAIL!

This guy also claims ""to be for our vets"", but he said so himself that he's not going to allow Muslims in our own military to return home because of what he's be purposing now in the media about alienating ALL Muslims who are abroad from our country. So he is basically saying that any Muslim that isn't currently in America when/ if Trump becomes president, they can not come home to America... This guy is dangerous and he needs to be stopped. He also did kiss Hilary Clinton's ass and he even donated to her campaign which basically means that she would have to repay him with a favor when she gets into office.

Trump is so full of shit and he's making a joke out of our election process and people are eating this shit up. This guy belongs on a TV show, not in a presidential election. He is unethical and immoral and selfish as all hell. If people think that Trump is going to actually help America you're fucking blind, this guy is a capitalist in the pure since of the word and a racist/bigot. He's going to fill his pockets with YOUR money and laugh all the way to the god damn bank and I dare someone to tell me I'm wrong.

Hell, it existed even before them, but it was a little bit different. Even so, sex with the same gender is not seen as an abomination in the Bible. Matter of fact, there's even a lesbian couple in the bible.
Besides, the Bible we read today is VASTLY different from the original one, as Kings and Queens and even Popes took out pages upon pages, just because they didn't like what was said. So, this means that, at one point of time, there might very well have been a page, paragraph or at the very least a sentence that accepts gay marriage.
The way people hate on homosexuals, is ungodly, might I add as, in the very Bible that we worship tells us to ""Love thy neighbour"" or as they told us in kindergarten, ""Treat others the way you want to be treated."" Hmm, I wonder where it says in the Holy Bible to hate on a person and say that they need change their ways by screaming in their face that they are ""WRONG!""
Need I remind all these so called ""Christans"" that many sins that were originally described in the Bible go as follows (and everyone breaks these, trust me), ""Never mix fabrics, no shaving your beard, no worshipping anyone or anything other than God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit, etc. etc. etc.""
Another thing the Bible says is that things change, and not to follow all these rules if they just don't fit the times. Well, times HAVE changed. Big time. We aren't in the Dark Ages, no more. We're in a wonderful world called hell The Future. Homosexuality is so big nowadays that you might as well accept it as a thing. It doesn't mean you have to like it, but it doesn't mean that you have to completely hate on someone just because of whom they love.

Alex asks Trump why are we messing with Putin when he has done nothing. Ummm nothing really of context there, Trump had the option to really say something ""mindblowing"" to the public like what is really going on over there in the Middle east. Like how our CIA directly funds the Deash to overthrow Assad in Syria (just like all of our planed attempts at divide and conquer v a common current enemy using religious mercenaries... most of Osama's troups were from outside the Middle eastern countries and were Mujandeems) to clear way for the pipeline from our alies, Saudi Arabia, then thru Turkey, and then finally thru Syria to deliver oil to western Europe to bypass Russia stronghold on oil for the region. We bombed Yemen because they wanted to get off the US Dollar standard for oil trade, to the gold standard just like Iran when we really started to have beef with them in the last 10 years. Yes we had Osama on our payroll to get rid of the godless commies in the 80s out of Afghanistan, than to US troups stayed in Saudi Arabia in the late 80's when Osama at that point took us a enemies that used him for our gains in the region. So this chaos in the area all started to really erupt when the US and Russia decided to try and tamper with the area... now 30 years later and we are doing the same. Jihad was not even a thing until the 80's, we kinda helped the reemergence of it because of our difference with Russia, funded the wrong types of people to do our dirty work... kinda like what is going on now with Syria, the vacuum of power in the region, and the emergence of the Deash (which we are finding out now the same fucking mercenaries (high ranking militants) that are building up their numbers again that were all released from miltary jail in Iraq after we pulled out. Our military is not that incompetent and they know what they are doing.


So Trump was against the Iraq war (BS), which he always says bankrupt the country (one of the many factors all at once), but yet in response he now wants to make our military the strongest it has ever been and bomb the area again. Good lord my head hurts with the man.",0,false,0,,,,,,

Now consider what it must be like to FINALLY have a politician speaking for the things he talks about, to finally have a spokesperson in the game of politics. Of course Alex wants, more than anything, to believe that this blowhard is the real deal.


Sadly, he isn't. Trump is a conman with a charismatic twist, and he's using Alex's entire freedom fighting community to gain popularity and get his foot into the door of the white house. If he gets elected, we will all be disappointed, just like we were with Obama. He will act very differently than he talks, and eventually, Alex will see him for what he is. 


This isn't some convoluted game of who's pulling who's strings. It's less controlled than that. It's less understandable.


It's just a result of human feelings. Alex must be tired of doing this on his own. He wants Trump to be on his side.

I understand where your concern is coming from and its totally valid. I don't like Trump as a person, he certainly is something of a blowhard who actually sounds pretty uninformed for someone running for the Presidency. And he does sound far far too militaristic and that is a major con in my book. Part of I think though, is him just putting on a tough guy act, I don't think he is anywhere near stupid enough to be provoking wars. He was against the Iraq war. I think he would actually be less likely to start another major war/campaign than a more bought and paid for careerist candidate. In my opinion, though I know I disagree with him on a lot, he does seem genuinely sincere and concerned. It isn't actually an easy thing to do self-funding a Presidential candidacy with the entire MSM ought to lynch him as was said in this interview. I've actually never bothered to vote before due to my cynicism (or realism) regarding the state of democracy these days, but I must admit despite all my reservations I do see what people like about Trump as perhaps the lesser evil candidate.",0

DT did not inherit $10 million it was more like $200 million in assets. Key word being ASSETS: an assets is something that generates income and/or value. So if his assets were worth $200 million they were still making him money on top of what they were worth. Also in the early 1990's The Trump Organization was bailed out by a large amount of bank that help the company as a whole not declare bankruptcy. Thru this bail out he was able to get 2nd and 3rd mortgages on his properties. Hardly self made. Here is a bit of none factual information. Research show that if he had taken those assets and invested that fortune in unmanaged stocks he would be worth $10 Billion more than what ever he is worth now(the reason it in those term is because he claim $10 Billion and multiple other sources of information say he is worth more around $4 Billion. who know) so if you ask me he lost money instead of made any more.So if he really is worth $10 billion he needs to ask him self where the other $10 Billion is. But if he is worth $4 Billion he better be mad as hell that his fortune is missing more than two times as much.  What was that last sentence you type again??,0

A vote for Trump is a vote for a corporate fascist surveillance state that will wage endless wars for profit and turn Trump into a billionaire, over the dead backs of the millions of people he will gladly sacrifice in the wars that will make him rich from the military industrial complex contracts.

Let me guess... You watch TV? You got a TV in your living room, don't you? Because that's the propaganda box that has brainwashed you to believe Trmp is gonna be your next best political savior messiah who's gonna make all your dreams come true..

A vote for Trump is a vote for a corporate fascist surveillance state that will wage endless wars for profit and turn Trump into a billionaire, over the dead backs of the millions of people he will gladly sacrifice in the wars that will make him rich from the military industrial complex contracts.

If you vote for him, that will clearly be because you've watched a lot of TV, and you like the TRUMP BRAND that the propaganda-media have brainwashed you with; a confident personality. Very appealing to Omega-Apes, who need a strong Alfamale to be their leader. Talk some muscle. Bomb some brown people.

Trump is most definitely the only man in the race who can save this nation.

Trump was against the zionist war, he is going to make our military large while not being imperialistic and fighting for Israel. He is red pilled and knows that the jzionist ews are basically responsible for everything wrong in western civilization today.




How can you be so ignorant about this? I would advise you to go watch some of hist interviews and realize that he an ingenious hustler with a grandeur vision looking to Make America Great Again.

interesting perspective - and i appreciate that your reply isn't hostile - i find that refreshing and it shows intelligence in my humble opinion - well... i guess what you said could have lots of truth to it - and perhaps if Hitler would have identified racial diversity and freedom as a strength rather than a weakness, Germany might be the super power of the world today - but, instead, and correct me if i'm wrong, i think he allowed hatred and fear take over too much and allowed such a great nation full of  great people be subjected to such ruin under his leadership - still makes no sense to me why he allowed that to happen - even nature tells us that when two things that are different reproduce, their offspring is usually way healthier and stronger than if two things come from the same family, race.. etc.. anyway...  Again - just want to say that i appreciate you sharing your views in an intelligent and un-hostile way! mucho appreciated - and i hope all of us (Americans) will come together and embrace our diversity as a strength - and that our stupid leaders will sort important problems out more quickly using intelligence for a change - before we start picking on each other. sending you all the best. merry xmas and happy new years to everyone.",1

z13zvrtbusfwh3ezm04cg3u5fp2ucbxqzak,brian messinger,1 year ago,1462664812516,"Grace not Law

We are saved by grace eph 2.8 says. so if it is by Grace then it is not by Law. Gal 5.4 says Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. See Law should not even be mixed with grace, and the only thing we can do to fall from grace is to try and follow law. Rom 6.14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. Clearly we are under Grace as Christians and not Law. Rom 4.15  Because the law worketh wrath: Yes the Wrath of God is upon all those who follow law . Jesus even hated the results of the Law so he, blotted the law out...blotted means to erase...Col 2.14  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; So if the law is so dangerous what is the Law? 
---------------------------

Sabbath resting on the 7th day is Law.
The Sabbath is not Saturday or Sunday, Heb 4.7 says,   Again, he limiteth (set a day) a certain day, saying in David, Today, after so long a time; as it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. So God changed the Sabbath to a day called--Today--meaning the day of salvation, the day of Grace this day is from Jesus' Resurrection even up to today. 2cor 6.2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.) We rest in Christ now, faith in Jesus Christ is our Sabbath. We rest in Jesus, but rest from what? from works of the law, things like Sabbath keeping, Tithing, water baptism, communion (grain offering). we rest from the law. How do we honor the Sabbath then? by casting out all works of the law. Just don't do them.  Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath.

---------------------------------

Tithing Money to church is the Law.
Tithing is not giving money or things. The tithe is giving glory to  Jesus Christ. Mal3.10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. when you do tithe we see that God will open the floodgates of heaven--Eph 1.3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: Eph 1.6 To the praise of the glory of his grace.  The whole tithe is not robbing God of his Grace.  So if you believe in the sabbath, water baptism, tithing then you are robbing from Christ sacrifice for man. Phili 2.9-11Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;  And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Jesus is Lord of the Tithe.
---------------------------------------

Water Baptism is the Law
Baptism is not immersing into water, it is immersing into Grace, dunked into Grace.
Acts 2.38  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. this does not say water baptism but baptism in the name of---yes we must be baptized in the name of Jesus. Acts 22.16 6 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.  here not with water but  with something that washes sin away. 1Jn 1.7 and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.---matt 26.28 8 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. yes faith in Christ shed blood is true baptism--not water

1 cor 15.56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. Gal 3.12 And the law is not of faith. Heb says that anything not of faith is sin. water baptism is not of faith it is flesh, outward, something that man does. Rom 6.3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? we are baptized into Christ death, and where did Christ die--was it not on the cross with the Law Col 2.14 He nailed the Law to the cross. Jesus nailed water baptism to the cross, Jesus nailed Sabbath keeping to the cross, Jesus nailed tithing to the cross, Jesus nailed communion (grain offering) to the cross. We to we must die to the law, we must die to water baptism, die to tithing, die to communion,  and the all the works of the law--this is true baptizing washing away the law. 

Eph 4.5One Lord, one faith, one baptism--let us focus on the real baptism of the spirit, not water. Heb 9.13 talks about a heifers ashes this is what was used to purify the water for water baptisms in the law, so it compares the power of water baptism to Heb 9.14 whish is the power of Christ -----How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God? do you what to be water baptized with water purified by a heifer? or the blood of Jesus Christ--Jesus is Lord of Baptism.

----------------------------

Taking real bread and wine-juice for communion is Law.
Communion is not eating the bread and wine. Jn 6.35 5 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. Communion is having faith in Jesus Christ. Jn 6.53-56  Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.  For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. but the people did not understand so then Jesus said, Jn 6.63 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life. Jesus says my words are spirit.

matt 4.4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. so the bread of God is his word, which is Jesus. Communion is when we read the word (old testament) and we discern the body and blood of Jesus. Most people read the old testament like the Jewish people, just at face value but this is wrong. for this reason they are blinded and 2 cor 3.14 says they have a veil over their eyes to this day--this veil is removed in Christ. when we read the old and discern the body and blood we understand that everything in the old is about Jesus and is Jesus. the water baptism is Jesus, the grain offering is Jesus, the animal blood sacrifice is Jesus, the Sabbath is Jesus--this is discerning the body and blood of Jesus

Lev 2 says that the communion (grain offering is the most holy of the food offerings) most Christians are staving today because they are being feed the word with out discernment of the body and blood of Jesus--We see the Jesus is the communion. When Jesus spoke to Nicodemus Jn 3.14 he said the snake on the pole in the old testaments was really a picture of Jesus on the Cross....and when Jonah was in the whales body for 3 days it was a pictures of Jesus in the tomb for 3 days. See Jesus discerned his body and blood when he was here. Every story, every Law, every prophecy has the body and blood of Jesus in it--get to work and start discerning his body and blood and you will grow healthy. Jesus is Lord

The methane is part of a chemical cycle that can be net carbon negative.

The United States had 3,932,181 births and 2,596,993 deaths in 2013 that is a growth of 1,335,188, so using that as a constant average then it would only make for around half of the population growth in the last 20 years...

Politics is a dirty game, everybody knows that. The dems could have thrown a huge wrench in his business plans if he snubbed them, and that includes Hillary. I don't feel that Trump himself is dirty, but he knew what he had to do to accomplish his business goals. At least he conducts himself and his business in an honest manner. All that being said, there will come a time in the very near future when we all will have to make a decision about whether we are going to vote for a candidate who says, and I believe actually does, want to make America great again.

While Donald Trump is anything but supportive of the LGBTQ community, it seems that he may be more supportive than any of his Republican opposition. Trump’s support of the Supreme Court decision is very unique in his party. Most Republicans see it as a wrong decision, and therefore are happy to see people such as Kim Davis oppose it. Trump, however, at least respects the ruling as law. Trump has also stated publicly that he does not believe that employees should be able to be let go because of their sexuality or their gender identity. Again, this is a unique stance to take as a Republican. There are no federal barriers to discriminating over sexual identity or gender identity. Furthermore, 31 of the 50 states do not have these barriers in place either. While Trump hasn’t been supportive of marriage for homosexuals, he has stated that he supports a “very strong domestic partnership law.” This law would afford homosexual couples rights equal to those of married heterosexual couples, it simply would not title it as “marriage.” Trump has also spoken out in favor of repealing the military’s Don’t Act Don’t Tell policy.",1

Many countries fought on the side of Hitler's Germany in WW2, including several non-white ones. One of Germany's primary allies of the 'Tripartite Pact' (signed on September 27, 1940) was not white, Japan. In fact, when the USA declared war on Japan the next year Germany honored the Tripartite Pact and declared war on the United States.

Indians, Asians, Arabs and blacks not only fought on the side of National Socialist Germany, but also wore the eagle and swastika proudly on their breast. Dozens of nationalities volunteered for the elite Waffen-SS and many non-whites of a wide range of ethnic backgrounds served the Axis in many capacities. In fact, it was the largest multi-racial fighting force in history! Not to mention also the most religiously diverse as well.

Commando Extraordinaire Otto Skorzeny describes the diverse nature of the Waffen-SS in his 1975 memoirs: 

'...from 1942 European soldiers from many lands and peoples could be found: Albanians, Bosnians, Britons, Bulgarians, Cossacks, Croats, Danes, Dutch, Estonians, Finns, Flemings, French, Georgians, Greeks, Hungarians, Italians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Norwegians, Romanians, Russians, Serbs, Slovakians, Swedes, Swiss, Ukrainians, Walloons, Armenians, Byelorussians, Hindus, Kirghizes, Tartars, Turkmen and Uzbeks served under their own flags in the Waffen-SS.

Edgar Hoover's Secret Intelligence Service to begin surveillance of Axis nationals in Latin America. Believing that ""all German nationals without exception [are] dangerous,"" the United States surreptitiously pressured Latin-American countries to arrest and deport more than four thousand civilians of German ethnicity to the United States.

While America was supposedly fighting for 'freedom' and 'democracy' in Europe, blacks were rioting and violently fighting for their rights back in America. For example, in 1943 black Americans rioted in the city of Detroit--the heavy hand of 'freedom' killed twenty-four of them!
Another example of America's hypocrisy and outright brutality was the inhuman treatment of WW2 veteran Isaac Woodard, Jr (March 18, 1919 – September 23, 1992). This black American was attacked by South Carolina police in 1946, while still in his army uniform, just hours after being honorably discharged from the United States Army! This attack was so brutal it blinded Woodard for life!
Ironic that when America occupied Germany after the war they brought with them their racist policies which were previously unknown in Germany.
The book The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943-1944, by Rick Atkinson (Macmillon, 2007) gives us some very interesting statistics of Allied racism:
'When War II began in September 1939 fewer than 4000 blacks served in the U.S. Army; more than two years later the U.S. Navy had only six black sailors-excluding mess stewards. At the time of the Anzio landings (May 1944), the U.S. Army had 633,000 officers, of whom only 4,500 were black. The U.S. Navy was worse, with 82,000 black enlisted sailors and no black officers; the Marine Corps which had rejected all black enlistments until President Roosevelt intervened, would not commission its first black officer until several months after the war ended...
…blacks were shunted into quartermaster companies for duties such as truck drivers, bakers, launderers, laborers and the like.'
A 1944 German propaganda leaflet targeting black American soldiers stated truthfully:
'In World War I they promised your father's racial equality as a reward for fighting the war.
What did they get? What did you get?
The lousiest jobs.
The lousiest flats.
The lousiest pay.
The lousiest chances.
Poverty, Unemployment, Race Riots, Lynching, Hanging and Burning!
and
The general contempt of all Whites in the U.S.A.

the Nazi Germany answer

Dr. Gross, a German physician who was head of the Office of Racial Policy for the NSDAP from 1933 until his suicide at the end of WWII, officially replied to Al-Gaylani as follows:
'In answer to your Excellency's letter of 17th October, 1942, 
I have the honor to give you the racial theory regarding the 
Arab caste. The racial policy has been adopted by Germany to 
safeguard the German people against the Jews who, 
biologically, are different from the Middle East races. 
Accordingly, Europe has been opposing Jews for decades. The 
Germans do not fight the Jews because they are Semitic or because 
they come from the East, but for their character, egoism and 
their hostility to society... while Germany forbids the 
entrance of the Jews into her territory, she welcomes all Arabs 
of Semitic origin and cares for them. The attitude of the 
Germans for the Arabs is that of respect. Not a single 
official German source ever stated that the Arabs originated from 
a lower caste. On the contrary, the racial theory of National 
Socialism considers the Arabs of a very high caste. The 
oppression of the Arabs of Palestine is being followed in Germany 
with great interest and Germany confirms the demands of the Arabs.'",0,false,0,,,,,,

Bill Clinton's NAFTA essentially moved white collar jobs to Canada & manufacturing jobs to Mexico. Barack's TPP will be the nail in the coffin by removing taxes such as the 25% tariff on Japanese automotive imports, thus Toyota can move all their factories in the US back to Japan and still be competitive. So to ""unfuck"" the USA, the tariffs need to be in place or brought back. So as an example, you're out shopping and you see two similar items, one is $1.25 while the other is $1.00. Most people (but not all) will buy the cheaper item. This is what the tariffs will do if imposed on cheap imports. Sooner or later, big corporations such as GE will find it's not feasible to be building appliances in China then shipping them to the USA (bc of the tariff), and so will have to think about moving their factories back into the USA or lose market share. It's business, it's economics. And big business conglomerates like GE will be scared af.",0

A vote for Trump is a vote for a corporate fascist surveillance state 
that will wage endless wars for profit and turn Trump into a 
billionaire, over the dead backs of the millions of people he will 
gladly sacrifice in the wars that will make him rich from the military 
industrial complex contracts.

If you vote for him, that will clearly be because you've watched a lot 
of TV, and you like the TRUMP BRAND that the propaganda-media have 
brainwashed you with; a confident personality. Very appealing to 
Omega-Apes, who need a strong Alfamale to be their leader. Talk some 
muscle. Bomb some brown people. 

Stupid ass cattle sheople waiting for their political messiah get disappointed time after time like brainless parrots singing the Mantra:
"" BUT THIS TIME WILL BE DIFFERENT! "" Fucking lemmings.

You would NEVER vote for him if you would even spend 3 minutes to google his politics. Or do you support more surveillance? Well, vote for Trump, and thats how he's gonna spend your tax money: on more cops, phone-tappers, etc",0

That's all well and good but there are also plenty of low income people that have won that didn't piss it away. Trump is the type that gets a $500 loan, starts a box making company and becomes wealthy.

To imagine Trump hasn't put in an enormous amount of hard work and critical thinking and has simply cruised along on a tide of privilege is ridiculous. He doesn't fit that pattern.

Most people who win the lottery and find themselves with nothing gave it away, either to friends, charity or their family or they created their own non-profit businesses. I also seem to notice that you believe that success is dependent on how much money you make. I assume you must be a very big fan of the Rothschild family then which is quite ironic since this channel is mostly filed with anti-Rothschild users yet they are far wealthier than Trump is (who, by the way has been financially struggling and it is not even known at this point if he even has a billion dollars worth of money after losing some of his biggest companies).",0

My you certainly are going on with the semantics. I'm clearly talking about financial success. You can't compare the Rothschilds to the average wealthy person and if you are defining success as someone having a place in history, then Jeffrey Dahmer is successful.

Keep in mind there are a lot of people that mindlessly parrot ""wealthy white people didn't do nuff'n for their money"", a lot of jealous envious types unaware that wealthy people mostly have gotten educations and have worked very hard, or people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs who ""didn't do nuff'n"".",0

If you asked most younger people today who he was they would look at you with a blank expression. Just like not many people today know about Gilles de Rais even though he caused a big shock in France at the time of his arrest as he was considered both one of the most prolific serial killers of the medieval ages and a highly-regarded military general up until the time of his arrest. He was also one of Joan of Arc's commanders at a time when he was younger and had not become a serial killer yet (He was one of the generals who won the Battle of Orleans). He had always claimed that the devil must have made him do it though some say that his years of fighting in the Hundred Years War may have given him PTSD, Survivor's Guilt and a whole range of other war traumas. As for Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, neither of them started their respective businesses alone (in fact, Steve Jobs had even resigned from Apple for some time when it was still new) and both of them had their companies built by other people working for them. Steve Jobs seldom admitted it, though Bill Gates while he was still the owner of Microsoft was not shy to admit that his company would not have been possible without other people working for him helping him out along the way. Even Stan Lee and Steven Spielberg among other media celebrities say that their veteran employees are a major reason for their success and Steven Spielberg, who use to work with other famous directors before he became famous said that working side by side with famous directors of the late 1950's and 1960's was a major reason he got the connections he did and why he was able to get into the film industry. In his case, a lot of it had to do with who he knew rather than what he knew.",0

I respect that you obviously have some intellectual curiosity, but you kind of ramble a bit. Any self made millionaire has a lot of help, they all say that. They are also good at any combination of elements such as leveraging what they have, being creative, industrious, organized, good at orchestrating an outcome, and good at team building. Trump though some of what he has done is questionable ethically, probably has most or all of those attributes. The notion Trump is just a rich kid that's simply sat around watching his dad's money build wealth for him is just a big fat juicy lie. Trump has a lot of self motivation and ambition  otherwise he would be unknown and wouldn't be worth a tenth of the wealth he's accumulated. There are plenty of examples of lazy silver spoon types that piss their family money away or simply ride on their daddy's coat tails (Bush jr.) Trump is a self made billionaire, blackys might not like it and they are ok with it if a rapper establishes a brand, but if a white person does it, they were simply ""privileged"" lol at that communist shit.

yes, nazi was short for national socialist, but they were in reality more to the right. hitler didn't even want to be associated with socialism.

and in comparison to global politics, bernie is a Centrist- Far from authoritarian- unlike the other candidates.
check out facebook's Republicans for Bernie page or reddit's ""I'm a Tea Party Republican considering Bernie sanders and i do not believe I'm alone""
as much as the corporate MSM (and infowars apparently) like to propagandize that bernie is an Extremist or ""Dirty Socialist!"", he's really the most moderate and practical and willing to compromise. the other candidates are the extremists. they are the corporate fascists.

and its really pathetic how alex praises trump for being against the iraq war and against the patriot act and against TPP considering bernie has Also opposed these! and they both have similar moderate stances on gun control. trump shares many of bernie's positions, but trump adds his hitler-esque warmongering and racist rhetoric to appeal to his angry lizard brained teatard base.",0

But Yeah go vote for a silver-spoon-fed self-important millionaire elitist who would sell you and your moms ass in a heartbeat. 

A vote for Trump is a vote for a corporate fascist surveillance state that will wage endless wars for profit and turn Trump into a billionaire, over the dead backs of the millions of people he will gladly sacrifice in the wars that will make him rich from the military industrial complex contracts.

If you vote for him, that will clearly be because you've watched a lot of TV, and you like the TRUMP BRAND that the propaganda-media have brainwashed you with; a confident personality. Very appealing to Omega-Apes, who need a strong Alfamale to be their leader. Talk some muscle. Bomb some brown people.

Trump is regularly selling his experience and talent for hiring and appointing the ""best people.""

The most famous moment in your media career was the encounter with Piers Morgan on CNN. It made you a household name.

Piers Morgan was an English newspaper editor -- and basically a nobody in America -- until Donald picked him as this winner of Celebrity Apprentice. 

Meaning: Donald fired every contestant except Piers Morgan. Donald made Morgan a household name. Without Trump, the English gun-grabber would never even have had a CNN show.

Worse,  Trump thought so highly of Piers Morgan than he brought him back to his show and appointed him as his boardroom consigliere and advisor.

You should have politely asked Mr. Trump about his trust and relationship with one of your sworn enemies, and whether he was going to stuff his cabinet with pantywaist gun-grabbers the same way he handpicked them for his TV boardroom.",1,false,0,,,,,,

A vote for Trump is a vote for a corporate fascist surveillance state that will wage endless wars for profit and turn Trump into a billionaire, over the dead backs of the millions of people he will gladly sacrifice in the wars that will make him rich from the military industrial complex contracts.

If you vote for him, that will clearly be because you've watched a lot of TV, and you like the TRUMP BRAND that the propaganda-media have brainwashed you with; a confident personality. Very appealing to Omega-Apes, who need a strong Alfamale to be their leader. Talk some muscle. Bomb some brown people. 

Stupid ass cattle sheople waiting for their political messiah get disappointed time after time like brainless parrots singing the Mantra:

If the United States ends globalization as you would want, in less then 5 years China, Russia and India will double their economy. China would surpass the US and that would be the end of the US as a power. The US dollar would be taken off as a world currency, unemployment in the US would reach levels it never reached before, we would not be able to afford the military that we have, we would loose the power we have in the UN and don't forget our debt to the international world that are in the trillions.

He'll have dual loyalties wherein America and American interests will always take the back seat to Israeli interests. Also his claim of paying for his own candidacy which is a lie. He's been paid off in advance by Jewish Bankers which is how he built such a large company over the years in the first place. Also if you go to his website you'll see him asking for donations. And, if you've signed up for e-mails from Donald you'll get special offers where if you spend $50 he'll send you a campaign kit free.

It's not just Afghanistan that has mineral wealth, so I imagine he'd invade all the countries he could, that were viable, just to steal all there stuff. America has been doing it for so long now it's not even questioned. Trump is smart enough to know that China is getting the better of the US. America rapes and pilages a country, and it costs them billions and kills millions, but China does it the smart and diplomatic way, and even though they are robbing just as much from other peoples counties as the US does, thay do it the smart way and don't spend billions on killing people. Money talks way better than bombs, but America is a military nation so they can't get out of that spiral. It's very reminisent of the fall of the Roman Empire, but this time there are Nukes involved and I can't see the US going down without a fight and if all fails then the nukes will be used.

who would sell you and your moms ass in a heartbeat. 

A vote for Trump is a vote for a corporate fascist surveillance state 
that will wage endless wars for profit and turn Trump into a 
billionaire, over the dead backs of the millions of people he will 
gladly sacrifice in the wars that will make him rich from the military 
industrial complex contracts.

If you vote for him, that will clearly be because you've watched a lot 
of TV, and you like the TRUMP BRAND that the propaganda-media have 
brainwashed you with; a confident personality. Very appealing to 
Omega-Apes, who need a strong Alfamale to be their leader. Talk some 
muscle. Bomb some brown people. 

Stupid ass cattle sheople waiting for their political messiah get disappointed time after time like brainless parrots singing the Mantra:
"" BUT THIS TIME WILL BE DIFFERENT! "" Fucking lemmings.

You would NEVER vote for him if you would even spend 3 minutes to google his politics. Or do you support more surveillance? Well, vote for Trump, and thats how he's gonna spend your tax money: on more cops, phone-tappers, etc",1

Many investors will not even talk to anybody unless they already know each other or somebody they know knows somebody who wants to pitch their product. Some people who are wealthy now have said that the only reason somebody invested in them was because they sometimes happened to have a product out or were talking about it to somebody else in an elevator at the time that an investor happened to get on with them and would overhear the idea and suddenly give them the money.

First of all, ""millionaire households"" does not make the people millionaires. Assets such as a house does not actually count in the millionaire statistics since hard cash is all that matters when talking about money. The second issue is that having a million dollars in a household does not make the people millionaires. For one, how long have they been saving the money for? Is the money divided by several people who earn far less than a million dollars? What is their salary? To be a millionaire you need to have a job that pays a million a year, otherwise all you have is an accumulated million dollars which was likely saved up over several decades and there is a good chance that by the time it gets to that point a million dollars will not mean as much as when you first started saving, nor will you likely have it with you anymore as there is a good chance you either spent it by that time on assets such as electronics, furniture, clothing, food etc. or you have it invested somewhere where you will not be able to touch it. Even if we were going by your 1/35 statistic, that is still less than 3%, and a million dollars means far less now than it did in the 1960's. In fact, by this reasoning most people would be quite well off if all of the items they ever bought in their life was counted amongst how wealthy you are. But statistics regarding millionaires does not work that way. You also forget that most wealthy people inherited their money. If a relative of mine died and they had a million dollar inheritance for me waiting in the banks, I would be a millionaire by this logic without doing anything other than being related.",0

In 1967 (around the time that Donald Trump got his million dollars), you could have bought a family-sized home in Toronto for under $15,000. Less than 48 years later a house in Toronto is now averaging around $1,300,000 and Vancouver is supposedly a little higher than that. This means that Donald Trump with his million dollars back then could literally have bought a house for a quarter of the amount that an average annual salary today would be needed to pay for an apartment, plus he could have bought a car for next to nothing (as cars back then were easily purchasable for around $500) and still have all that money left over to invest in infrastructure and buildings which were a lot cheaper back then than they would be today. A millionaire today does not mean as much today, at least not if we are going by your logic. And just because people are paying a million dollars into their homes does not mean they own a million dollars. It just means they own a house that costs a million dollars and it does not include the interest that would be paid nor does it mean they will be able to sell their houses again for the price they put into it (especially when interest rates are considered). Donald would never have needed to pay any interest on a house back then because he would have been able to pay a house upfront and not pay any interest at all. Meaning that a poor person still pays far more for the same things as someone who was handed all of that money.",0

z12jzv1gks33wthc123ftz34wmmqh5vmb,Jedi Pauly,1 year ago,1462664870790,"I am sorry but Trump and Alex are traitors to the country because they call and accept Obama to be a President when he is not a ""natural born Citizen"".  They are brainwashed to beleive that anyone who is born to a U.S. citizen mother, or born in the U.S. territory, is a ""natural born Citizen"", which is FALSE!  The biggest lie and con-job in American history, and Trump and Alex have fallen for it.

The truth is very easy to see and comprehended.  nbC status is not governed by territory, by the citizen mother, or by Positive Law at all.  The term ""natural born Citizen"" is governed solely by Natural Law as a natural inherited right which is endowed from a citizen father alone.  The term ""natural born Citizen"" is an adjective phrase ""natural born"", which is modifying a noun title ""Citizen"", which is why ""Citizen"" is capitalized because you always capitalize noun titles in the English language.  The term ""natural born"" is taken from the civil law, and just means the end result of sexual reproduction, i.e , it means the legal opposite of 'adopted', as in the sentence, ""Are those your natural born children (natural children) or are they adopted?"".  Thus ""natural born Citizen"" means NOT the adopted citizen.  The adopted citizen is called a ""naturalized citizen"", a function of Positive Law, i.e., a grant of a 'legal right', not an inherited Natural Right of citizenship.

There are only two kinds of citizen, naturalized and natural born.  The offspring of non-citizen fathers are the adopted naturalized citizens, the one's born to a citizen mother or just born in the U.S. territory jurisdiction under the 14th Amendment.  They are just granted a legal right of citizenship by Positive Law, a legal right which is the legal opposite to a Natural Law right.  The non-adopted, natural born, the one's who do not receive a bestowed 'legal right' of citizenship because they inherit their right as a natural right claim, are just the offspring of U.S. citizen fathers who come from a State of the Union.

The law is governed by natural biology, i.e., by the fact of Nature that only females give birth to offspring.  Due to the fact of Nature that only females give birth to offspring, only the female citizen can have sex and give birth to either a natural born Citizen, or give birth to a naturalized citizen, depending upon who the father is and whether or not he is already a citizen.  However, only the male who is a U.S citizen from a State of the Union can only have sex and always only create another U.S. citizen with the sex act, a non-adopted natural born Citizen, i.e., a non-adopted indigenous member of the society.  Only the offspring of a citizen father is always born with a natural right claim to membership in only the U.S.  This is why nbC status naturally goes by the male citizen father alone, and it is not unfair or an inequity towards female citizens.  The female citizen or the place of birth are only conduits to adopt and naturalize the offspring of foreign non-citizen males, but the male citizen can only create a natural born Citizen with his sperm, regardless of who the mother is or where the offspring is born.  This is what is meant by ""natural born Citizen"".  It is totally obvious.  The law is codified as 8 USC 1409 and is verified by the Supreme Court in the case Nguyen v. INS 533 U.S. 53 (2001).",1,false,0,,,,,,

The US has always had plenty of good surveillance.  It is the political action, or inaction, that has been faulty.

You clearly do not value freedom. End of story. That makes you less American than most Muslims.

It is clear you are xenophobic too, because you paint all Muslims in one broad stroke and don't separate extremists. You don't even seem capable of separating Sunni, Shia, and Sufi Muslims. Do you think Catholics and Christians are the same too? That's how large a mistake you would be making by ignoring religious sects in Islam.

Let me be clear: I am an atheist. But it's painfully obvious that ESPECIALLY in the West, Christianity is far more oppressive than Islam, although both are EQUALLY as murderous and EQUALLY as oppressive.

You looking at ISIS and Al Qaeda as representative of Islam is like me looking at the KKK, Ted Cruz, and the Westboro Baptist Church as representative of Christianity.

Either you accept the freedom of those with different religious beliefs or you don't - no exceptions. Every day soldiers die for this right in the West and here you are making a fucking mockery of it.

If 99% of muslims are primitive savages and then you let them read a book that claims they are superior and all non-believers deserve death, they WILL believe it. If you tell that to me, I would simply laugh at you and move on. You see the difference ? It's about maturity. Koran would not stand a chance in our modern society, yet in primitive societies (arabs) it causes chaos and destruction. So YES, books CAN be dangerous.

That being said, seriously, before you insult someone, learn how to structure your sentences like an adult. At least take time to fix your typos. 

In response to your statement. Are you really serious with that reply?!?!? To the common American his statement is an insult-- ""I started with NOTHING."" Which in Trump language means a million dollars-- or according to you 200 million. That's so stupid. According you, whatever number you start out with, if you can multiply that number then the original amount is ""nothing"". 


That's the fantasy world you both live in. In most other places, there are people that DO start out with nothing. Living in cars, or vans, or working two jobs just to make ends meet. THAT'S nothing. Starting out in the red. That's nothing. 


Ok maybe to Trump two hundred million is nothing, but that's not the intention of his statement. He was trying to be relatable with the average voter. He was saying that he is the American Dream. He was trying to say that he started with ""nothing"", in other words million dollars his father gave him, and by his boot straps, and rolled sleeves built his empire. So in other words, he's a working class guy. He's one of US. Which shows how asinine that comment is.",0

Obviously not.
The way Sanders says he will fix things is comical. This guy is an idiot that will solidify us as a 3rd world nation. He's telling people what they want to hear and face it. The average person today has an IQ of about 85.

It's literally like these people are getting their diplomas out of a cracker jack box. 

Barack Obama is handing our nation over to the Chinese, the Mexican cartels and the Muslim extremists. It's absolutely unbelievable that people are actually so stupid that they don't see the connection between the drivel Sanders is saying and the drivel Barack Obama used to get elected.

He is connected to all the ""  Wealthiest People on this Planet , who are the ""Movers and Shakers of this World. These people first and foremost ""TRUST"" him completely, with their Money, their lives and  "" Respect "" him fully, and you know these "" Wealthy  One Percent of the World  "" do not allow anyone in their circle
unless  they had been completely,  thoroughly check out by the most stringent
security only  billions of money can buy,


I 'm fully aware that  Millions of Americans really do not know who Donald Trump is, that is why I'm sharing this very important information  to the World, 
Many  very important  people in the government had asked him since 1982 to run for President, but he politely declined the offer several times due to his  massive business enterprise,  businesses obligations, very hectic schedule,


He is the  one of the hardest working man I know in my life. He is like a ""die -hard battery"" he just keeps going,  He has many endearing qualities such as:
He is Honest to the bone, Very Loyal to his friends, Humble, Caring and Funny,
He is  someone who anyone can relate to because he really is a very ""down to earth person "" No  Fakeness, No AIrs, really good to be around with .


Lastly, Donald Trumps knows a whole lot about  what's going on all over the World, more than most of our  security experts or our government leaders
because he has over 30 years of  business and personal dealings with their
Countries Leaders,  it's just a natural  part of doing business,, so  when he says
that "" he can do  something "", that is most likely possible, because he has
good, long lasting personal and business relationship with the leader of that Country.


I hope with these shared info about ""The Donald "" I have enlightened many of you. He is a ""REAL NICE GUY "", so please be  ""FAIR ""


He is going to be ""One f the best "" President of this Country, and He will make this country ""GREAT AGAIN "" !!!!!! TRUMP 2016 !",1

z131ddlygm2lhridh223u1sjaz2oy11hh04,Javi chino,1 year ago,1462664895259,"In truth, the belief in ""government"" is a religion, made up of a set of dogmatic teachings, irrational doctrines which fly in the face of both evidence and logic, and which are methodically memorized and repeated by the faithful. Like other religions, the gospel of ""government"" describes a superhuman, supernatural entity, above mere mortals, which issues commandments to the peasantry, for whom unquestioning obedience is a moral imperative.

Larken Rose, The Most Dangerous Superstition

If you personally advocate that I be caged if I don't pay for whatever ""government"" things YOU want, please don't pretend to be tolerant, or non-violent, or enlightened, or compassionate. Don't pretend you believe in ""live and let live,"" and don't pretend you want peace, freedom or harmony. It's a simple truism that the only people in the world who are willing to ""live and let live"" are voluntaryists. So you can either PRETEND to care about and respect your fellow man while continuing to advocate widespread authoritarian violence, or you can embrace the concepts of self-ownership and peaceful coexistence, and become an anarchist.

Governments around the world including the U.S. will be at the fiscal mercy of the new financial high priests through the use of insidious debt based incentives given or withheld at the whim of the IMF.

In addition to this, new technologies have emerged making the use of fossile fuels obsolete. Thorium based technology have been patented by Norway and will begin production of energy in 2017 trough conventional reactors.

What about the 5 dancing Israelis who were there to document the event? How did they know the ""event"" was going to happen? 

""Of the 90 or so detained Israelis there was a group of five Israelis, now widely known as the ""dancing Israelis"", who were spotted in multiple locations filming, and celebrating the attacks.
The men were detained by NYPD. The police and FBI field agents became suspicious when they found maps of the city with certain places highlighted, box cutters (the same items that the hijackers allegedly used), $4,700 cash stuffed in a sock, and foreign passports. Police also told a New Jersey local paper, The Bergen Record, that bomb sniffing dogs were brought to the van and that they reacted as if they had smelled explosives. According to the Jewish Weekly Forward the FBI later determined that at least two of the Israelis were Mossad agents. Their names were Sivan & Paul Kurzberg, Yaron Schmuel, Oded Ellner & Omer Marmari.""
""According to ABC News 20/20, after these five Israelis were detained, the driver of the van - Sivan Kurzberg - told the officers: ""We are Israeli. We are not your problem. Your problems are our problems. The Palestinians are the problem.""
They later appeared on an Israeli talk show and claimed that they were in NYC that morning ""to document the event"". Witnesses reported they had set cameras PRIOR to the first plane strike, and were seen congratulating one another afterward. The five jubilant Israelis were also seen photographing one another. The FBI seized and developed their photos, one of which shows Sivan Kurzberg flicking a cigarette lighter in front of the smoldering ruins in an apparently celebratory gesture. """,1,false,0,,,,,,

So if the Christians DON'T FERVENTLY PRAY IN Faith and it's best to do by praying in tongues and thus release the Power of the Holy Spirit and push back the darkness in this nation AND VOTE TRUMP and others who God is anointing for public office (faith without ACTION is USELESS) then NOTHING WILL BE DONE for America.

Christians hold all the answers.  Jesus already won the Victory.  We are God's police force and we need to ENFORCE the Victory Jesus won and arrest and stop the criminal forces of darkness in America!!!

God has anointed and appointed Donald J. Trump to be our next president to make America greater than it ever has been before and now it's up to us to make it happen.  But know God is on our side ,  and His anointing is UPON Trump NOW.  We have our part to do though.  Very important!!!!",0

But social media, youtube and podcasts in 2014-15 from new redpilled people is changing a lot of false conceptions people actually love to believe if they are ready to know more about history.
Thanks to SJWs, Leftists and Feminists, and Uber-Atheists, I changed from Liberal Atheist to Alt-Right NatSoc Post-Atheist in one year.

Stop believing in utopian bullshit of made of kittens and rainbows. You sound like a Libertarian believing in NAP and other fairy tales. Happiness and good things comes from people who fights for it against others who doesn't want you to get it for yourself or even themselves.",0

The Pauls? They are like Cicero, though of Plebeian stock himself, they back the Optimate cause out of ideology, even if they have sympathy for the people, they cannot possibly act against their cultish beliefs in the ""cult of the founders"" Romulus/Remus (Washington/Jefferson) and the Roman Constitution which says not to cross the Rubicon (or not to detain NWO bankers without a trial, not to take the trillions they've stolen without proper due cause, etc. which means they could use those trillions to collapse America during a Paul presidency and forever tarnish the name of libertarianism (it would be blamed as ""what destroyed America' for 1,000 years).

Republics were the #1 cause of death in the 20th century. Over 140 million citizens of Republics were murdered by their own governments (whereas not a single genocide of their own people has ever occurred under Monarchies, although there were a few colonial atrocities they were never directed against their own people). The greatest irony is in Russia where the accidental shooting of one citizen during a protest was called a ""bloody sunday"" and widely known as the reason Russia turned into a Republic which then genocided 40 million people ON PURPOSE.

As Stalin said, ""The death of one man is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic"". America has been lucky as one of the few Republics not to genocide it's own people, but it is simply because they have guns as a right. If America is disarmed (as the Left intends), it will be the next Republic to genocide it's own as all Republics do.  America already committed genocide of the Philippines (98% of Americans are unaware America occupied the Philippines, crushed their Republic which was based on the US constitution, and then put the Filipinos in concentration camps and over 1 million were murdered by America, a mini-holocaust before WW2).

Anyways, America will become a dictatorship as all Republics do. The question is, do you want a good leader, a Caesar who made Rome Great Again, who cared about his legacy and the fate of the country, or do you want to put an ineffectual Optimate in charge who will be toppled and replaced with a Left-wing dictator like Pol Pot/Mao/Stalin,etc. 

It is inevitable at this point. The best America can hope for is a Trump or peaceful secession (although our new Republics will have the same problem and eventually become dictatorships too, we can at least delay it so our grandchildren suffer it instead of ourselves, but is that really the right path? it is far better to steer it in a positive direction).

And really does anyone think Lincoln and the civil war was preferable to rule by Queen Victoria and the golden age of peace and prosperity under her?  Or that the current Queen Elizabeth II is not preferable to Bush/Clinton, etc. (she directly ruled Bermuda, a majority black island in the Atlantic, and later appointed a royal governor and it is now the highest income island in the carribbean, with a per capita income of nearly $90,000 per person, vastly wealthier than most Americans).

The top 10 per capita income countries are almost ALL absolute monarchies (or constitutional ones) like Lichtenstein, Monaco, the UAE, Brunei, and then next on the list is Norway which is a constitutional monarchy. Heck, even Bernie Sanders keeps pointing to monarchies as his examples (Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are all 99% white monarchies).  People are so blind to the simple truth.

“There, right in the midst of our lives, is that which satisfies the craving for inequality, and acts as a permanent reminder that medicine is not food. Hence a man’s reaction to monarchy is a kind of test. Monarchy can easily be ‘debunked;' but watch the faces, mark the accents of the debunkers. These are the men whose tap-root in Eden has been cut: whom no rumour of the polyphony, the dance, can reach - men to whom pebbles laid in a row are more beautiful than an arch. Yet even if they desire equality, they cannot reach it. Where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires, athletes or film-stars instead: even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison.” 
- C.S. Lewis, 1943, seems to predict the future prophetically describing how America would worship the ""famous prostitutes"" like the Kardashians and Hiltons nearly 70 years later, or more sooner, the gangster worship endemic in American society (Godfather, Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc.) heck an AMC tv series ""making of the mob"" I think, said the murderous drug-dealing gangster Lucky Luciano lived the ""American Dream"" TWICE in one episode this past month.",2

God is not a lying God, his word has NEVER lied.  You quoted scriptures from 1 Kings; yet you FAILED to tell the story...  So let me tell it for you.
Ahab's prophets were stricken to deliver ""negative"" and wicked prophesies to Ahab, because Ahab did very evil things in the sight of the Lord. Allowing his wife to use his name for murder, for a vineyard that he could not have, and for his worship of idolatry.

Saul was smitten with evil spirits (that were soothed by the sounds of Heavenly Music), because he ALSO did not obey the commands of the Lord.
Both of these Kings were punished for their evils, for going against the words of GOD ALMIGHTY.  

For anyone interested in knowing the Story Of Ahab smitten with negative, prophets; read: 1 Kings 21:1 - 21:29

For anyone interested in knowing why Saul was smitten with temporary evil spirits;
read 1 Samuel 15:1- 16:23 

Both Bible Scriptures are EXCELLENT reading...  The Story of the Bible truly is the best ever written. Especially these two occurrences, and how they came to be punished by the Lord for their acts of evil and not following his commands.",6

Get rid of Fake Federal Reserve and bankrupt himself again!!!!! Nixon shock no gold...!!! So no President can do what got J.F.K killed in 1963 issuing United States of America Notes....

All the while our Military and tax money is used by other Countries. Acts like the Sept 2014 McKeon Amendment  which make it possible to fund ""REBELS"" so our troops can be everywhere wake up people 9/11 day your rites go in the trash 3 buildings 2 planes Judy Wood explains that in depth no doubts or just Google 9/11 burnt cars all over NewYork",0

Why wouldn't a Muslim Male stop at nothing to produce male offspring? P.O. himself calls his spouse Michael, they were were college room mates, and it wasn't coed. If you can't tell a male from a tranny, then you must have had many embarrassing moments you would rather not relate to everyone. Mich's hands are a give away, ring finger longer than index. Male trait. Muscular upper and fore arms, the broad shoulders,  that is a dude. The daughters don't share one family trait with the parents or each other.
Unless all you see is Black. I don't don't have issues with the skin color, got over that in the Navy. Fine people come from all walks of life and Races. I wouldn't listen to B.O. during his campaign, I can tell when someone is lying to me, and it's even more obvious with the sound turned off. An attorney is a professional liar. They carefully script their words, spend hours before a mirror rehearsing over and over their script, mannerisms and facial expressions in order to convince the courts and jury of their sincerity. Worse? This one was a corporate attorney. Which means ""F"" the public. Knowing that, don't you now realize what he's been up to all along?
He isn't incompetent, he is doing exactly what the middle east has wanted all along. To destroy America.
And thanks to morons like you, who voted for him twice! He just might succeed. If you want to stop being a Sheeple, put down your hypnotic phone, turn on YouTube, check out Agenda 21, NWO, and Sustainable development. Just because the people responsible label us conspiracy theorists, doesn't mean there isn't a huge world wide conspiracy to destroy what this country has produced for over 215 years. Yes I know that doesn't equal 240 years but the last 25 really sucked. My ancestor fought in the Revolutionary War, he was Canadian, my grandfather immigrated to this great country, produced my father a veteran, produced me, a veteran. My service was highly distinguished. Letter of commendations by Admirals, respected by my superiors, coworkers and peers, and most of it too classified to mention. I have an IQ well over 130, estimated above 150. I am sought after by people with higher IQ's than mine. I am proficient in a dozen career fields. I am a skilled marksman, I can draw a perfect string of pearls on a silhouette at 25 yards with a 1911 Gold Cup Match. Drive nails off hand at 100 meters with 18 knot cross winds. Fix or improve most anything made by a human being. 
I am 56 years old, and my mother is constantly astounded of all things I am proficient at, and learns new things every few weeks. Calling me stupid? That's amusing. Maybe you should go into comedy. Although I have been stupid on occasion,  I am after all human. But stupid is doing something even though you knew better. You on the other hand don't seem to know Jack Schitt, so can't be called stupid. Just blissfully ignorant. What a shame.

Most people here are speaking about things that they feel would be better for the country, that they think would being about liberty, freedom, positive, growth and health to this country they love, they love their fellow Americans and such, yet they cannot treat each other with the same respect online in a very simple message. Cyber warriors I swear. Was all that negativity and condescension necessary Michael? If you want this kind of positive change for your country, you have to start with how you treat every day people you normally come in contact with. Let's drop this negativity. 

Btw, as to your other post you were referencing, it's called the New American Century, and it's a neocon think tank that had the likes of Donald Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz as part of the member of this agenda. There were a couple of these kinds of forms developed where they planned scenarios, some of which were they would fund reactionary fundamentalist groups as proxies to overthrow Assad etc.

In answering your comment about ""looks"" I'm not saying all of that, I'm responding directly to what you said simply about how Obama looks. Looks mean nothing, that has to do with public relations. History has had all kinds of powerful heads of state that were demur, and little etc, but they carried a big stick and were very smart. Some were soft spoken and others were loud. In the end, it's how the president, or prime minister, etc, runs their country.  

Btw, maybe I'm wrong, but when did I mention anything about border issues?? And what do you mean ""should I translate?"" is that suppose to be because I'm Hispanic you're making a racial thing out of this? or insinuating that I just can't understand you? Regardless of what it is, you sound very immature, we need to stop calling each other stupid and making ad hominem attacks on each other in these comments, at least you can on your own. 

I've been reading about Trump and all these globalists you speak of for over 20 years, my conclusions come out different than yours, but doesn't mean I'm dumb, or that you are. I'm not going to get into a debate with you about these things cause I don't think it will go anywhere with you based on the level you want to stoop to. Peace.....",0

He cannot come right out and say big banks and corporations are controlling our country. The press would be all over it calling him a conspiracy theory nut. He would be done.

The problem with Presidential candidates ""following the law"" is that they are trying to seize power from entrenched interests. You CANNOT do that legally. You would be weakened from within, they would flood it with lawyers, money, or collapse it financially, or at worst kill the man who opposes them like the Senators who stabbed Caesar so treacherously.

Secondly, Hitler, Mao, Stalin, Pol Pot, Robespierre were all elected. Republics are horrible forms of government. Choosing leaders by elections guarantees at BEST, rule by Aristocracy since only the famous or wealthy win. At worst, the Aristocracy is in chaos and loses it's hold and a charismatic demagogue (Hitler/Mao/Stalin) takes over.

The best a Republic can ever hope for is a generalissimo like Caesar or Napoleon or Trump who steps up like Cincinattus in a time of crisis to ""save the Republic""/Make Rome Great Again like Julius/Augustus did.

America really missed out by abandoning Monarchy. Do you really think Andrew Jackson's trail of tears and Abraham Lincoln's civil war were preferable to Queen Victoria's golden age and abolition of slavery without shedding a single drop of blood?

The right-wing in Republics always go crazy with paranoia because they worship a dead piece of paper (Roman Constitution/American Constitution) and ""cult of the founders"", instead of rallying behind a monarch. It is perhaps a logical fear in Republics because without a monarch as referee (like the King of Spain who overthrew the Spanish dictators or the King of Italy who arrested Mussolini), then dictatorship is likely. So it is that LOGICAL fear of dictatorship that causes the right-wing such paranoia and instability.

“There, right in the midst of our lives, is that which satisfies the craving for inequality, and acts as a permanent reminder that medicine is not food. Hence a man’s reaction to monarchy is a kind of test. Monarchy can easily be ‘debunked;' but watch the faces, mark the accents of the debunkers. These are the men whose tap-root in Eden has been cut: whom no rumour of the polyphony, the dance, can reach - men to whom pebbles laid in a row are more beautiful than an arch. Yet even if they desire equality, they cannot reach it. Where men are forbidden to honour a king they honour millionaires, athletes or film-stars instead: even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison.”
- C.S. Lewis, 1943, seems to predict the future prophetically describing how America would worship the ""famous prostitutes"" like the Kardashians and Hiltons nearly 70 years later, or more sooner, the gangster worship endemic in American society (Godfather, Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc.) heck an AMC tv series ""making of the mob"" I think, said the murderous drug-dealing gangster Lucky Luciano lived the ""American Dream"" TWICE in one episode this past month.",1

Do you think the NWO bankers with trillions in their pockets would just bleakly submit to a President Paul ""requesting"" they hand back the trillions they stole?   It would require a President Trump gathering his legions and crossing the rubicon and taking them by surprise.  It will take aggression to take back the Republic, of that there can be no mistake.  The Pauls are Optimates through and through. While they have sympathy for the people, themselves being of Plebeian stock, they are like Cicero, a plebeian made Senator, who out of loyalty to the ""cult of the founders"" (Romulus and Remus/Washington and Jefferson) and the Roman Constitution, could not side against the entrenched Aristocratic interests even when he knew they did not benefit the people. The Pauls could not break the Constitution even to save the People. They would try to do things by the book, and would at best be gotten rid of quickly, or at worst, they would be so ineffective as President that they'd be a laughingstock (like how one ""do-nothing"" Congress hurt the Republicans for 50 years, a ""do nothing"" President would hurt us for 100 years) and the elite would simply use their trillions to render him ineffective or even collapse American financially during a Paul presidency to guarantee the tarnishing of their legacy/ideology.

Whereas a Trump would not let them run off with the treasury, he would use operatives, seize their illegally gotten gains, etc. etc. He would not allow America to collapse, he would use whatever means necessary, he will cross the Rubicon. The Pauls would be scared of the ""sacred"" tradition. They worship Romulus and Remus and the Roman Constitution the same as Cicero. Just changed the names to Washington/Jefferson (ironically Washington was a dictator during the Revolution and gained power as a Warrior-King, he never campaigned for office, not one campaign speech, he was offered the crown/presidency because of his military prowess not political charisma).",1

He was a not a model for Republican government, but a King who refused the crown, probably because he had no capable son to pass a crown to (big ""what if"" of history is if he had a great son or adopted heir like Julius had Augustus, etc.).

That said, the worship of our very own Romulus & Remus founding cult is disturbingly similar to how the Roman Senators would yell about the traditions of the founders in their Senate. And I'm sure the Romans would think themselves still in Rome if they witnessed the Statue of Liberty (the pagan Roman goddess) or the giant Roman-style columns in our nation's capital.

Remember, the Roman Emperor was not called Emperor. He was named ""First Citizen"" considered ""equal"" with the people, just ""first"" and ""presiding"" over them (basically the same word as President) and the Roman Emperors kept the Roman Senate around to rubber stamp their actions just like how the American Senate rubber stamps all Presidential military actions today.",0

Yeah, we are about like people in Germany hoping that once the Fuhrer takes power there won't be any need for all this anti-immigrant rhetoric. But the thing is, it doesn't do any good to vote for some intellectual do-gooder that will go down in flames. For what, so that history books will show Ron Paul received 10%? In a system where whistle-blowers are being prosecuted, we need someone who will institute some real change. The America we all idealize and even perhaps once knew will never return. Many minorities and poor never knew the idealized America. So this is about the future. People want leadership and a vision. Not the status quo. All we are being told is China will be #1 by the same people selling us out to China. We can't expect the next century to be an American century with our leaders continuing to commit what in past would have been treason; if not the letter of the law, certainly the spirit of our Constitution. Not figuratively, but literally for money, power, and prestige. They come to Washington with maybe 2 suits and a used car. But by the time they leave, they are millionaires with mistresses and limousines.

Remember the lesson of Weimar Germany. The man on the street can give a shit about what ""ism"" he is under, he wants a job, and food on the table. Remember the Houston Mayor, fortunately she overreached and her resentment and anger was her undoing. Like I said, many poor and minorities don't care about all that NDAA globalist cabal talk. They have died without trial while in custody, slammed to the pavement for matching a description of a black person, told to enter by the back entrance, and go to jail about 10x quicker than a Caucasian. Many don't give a shit about what you are concerned with. They lived with a police state. Seriously dude, screw all this police state, surveillance, NDAA talk; many in our country live it everyday. Donald Trump may break a few eggs, but if you keep your head down and work hard, everything should be okay. It certainly can't get much worse for the poor and minorities.

First of all, a ticket TRUMP/CRUZ is like a dream team for our nation!

The fact that Ted Cruz is a Christian should not cause anyone to fear because Christians don't push their religion down people's throat, or else! Like our peaceful brethren the Muslim... (I'm being very sarcastic!)

You have never seen a Christian blowing up in marketplaces, or planting bombs in hotels, or beheading the unbelievers, have you?

Therefore, that good side of Ted Cruz should not offend anyone but we must look at his great side: a patriot who appreciates freedom especially because of his parents' background-Socialist Cuba. So he will defend it. 

He is the most knowledgeable of our country's Constitution  and he abides by it, unlike the current usurper in our WH who has no respect for it and instead has stepped on it despitefully. 

Ted Cruz is not a coward or a flip flopper like most demo-rats and because he is a Christian, he does not lie, he does not steal, he won't have his enemy killed (like HC or Obama have caused people to disappear... or have car/plane accidents). His faith will enable him to be the best public servant as opposed to king-odumba who can't finds more ways to waste our country's money. 

When the Lord Jesus comes and takes his children and Ted Cruz and hopefully Trump too, it's okay, you don't have to go with them, you can stay. You are never forced.  See how Christians work?",1

Most, poorly addressed. Our Founders believed Defense was here. They were against Foreign Entanglement, Going Abroad to seek Monsters to Destroy, and believed in peace and commerce with all Nations. Every Democrip and Rebloodlican is out to be the most militaristic. Trump seems to be no different. I never heard him say in any interview, we should have a Declaration of War, before going to war, or, that we should bring the Troops home and concentrate on Defending this Country. All this country seems to be interested in is causing more Blowback, to keep this going on. He's very much into keeping legal immigration and visas going at current levels. I'm glad he is against Illegal Aliens, but we not only don't have enough good quality jobs for those here now, but also, the social safety net is unsustainable. It's my humble opinion that all immigration needs a pause. It's been done before, and should have been done by the economic downturn we have been in since 2007. His International Trade ideas will harm the poor, and shrinking middle class. But they sound good to the masses. All in all, our best bet is to see who the Libertarian and Constitution Parties run. If no one is good, just sit this one out. What with electronic voting machine fraud, and the electoral college, our votes mean nothing anyway. My vote, would not decide my States outcome, nor yours in your State.",0

It festers horrible corruption and engenders closed thinking and options. I like to use Tom Woods phrase: ""Party politics restricts thinking to a 3 x 5 card of allowable opinion..""

My understanding of Trump's policy on defense is to build a strong defense so we don't have to go to war. Instead, focus on infrastructure of our crumbling transportation system, paying off the debt and balancing the budget including abolishing unconstitutional agencies such as the DOE and EPA. He wants to make Japan, South Korea PAY for their defense. I think this is brilliant! However, I would like to hear his policy on all of the other bases we have around the world. He can't list all of them in a speech.

He was against the wars in the Middle East for over two decades now. However, now that the US created ISIS, he wants to go in with a distinct plan, do the job and destroy them which includes destroying their wealth by eliminating their oil supply and banking system, recovering our expenses by taking the oil, instead of Iran, and paying for the war and helping the vets. Also, letting Russia help in the chore since we have overlapping interests in this regard., thus saving US lives and expense. This IS defending the US at this point , militarily and economically using damage control. Whether he intends to make transportation a federal activity is unclear, since that is not their constitutional authority..

Regarding immigration, I believe he has several sound ideas: (1) Finally build a wall. I really believe he will get that done, (2) Enforce immigration laws by deporting illegals and giving legitimate aliens a chance to come back legally. This will NOT require a massive deportation force to accomplish this task. (3) He especially wants to retain the productive who were educated at the highest levels since they are likely to be the jobs creators of the future.(4) Stop the influx of refugees since there is a good chance of importing terrorists.

I agree that legal immigration should be curtailed. I am not one hundred percent sure he would be against that. 

We all agree that major corporations are fleeing this country to do business overseas and this is greatly harming the employment rate because of outrageous taxes and regulations. He will make it attractive to bring back business and attract new ventures. I cannot see how that will harm the poor since corporate growth will stimulate manufacturing jobs eg Ford, GM, Nabisco, Pfizer etc. Nevertheless, this is well within his constitutional boundaries.

I completely agree about the voter fraud amongst political parties, one of the dangers Washington warned about. However, there are action agencies fighting the electronic voter fraud . I believe this is a more viable approach then not voting. We have to also stop manual voting in secret. We have to watch the paper trail every step of the way.

Overall, the voting public treats the presidential elections like the coronation of a king. WE are the king in America and we have to focus our efforts much more at the local level. WE have to limit government by vigilance, NOT depend on a prince in DC to save our lives. WE have to do the job, not a president. I am with Ted Nugent and Michael Boldin on this one. Our country was meant to be a decentralized government and a federal government focused outward with vastly limited powers. The more we focus on bureaucrats in a far away place, the more power they will usurp. I believe our best efforts are to enforce states rights by nullifying every unconstitutional law they have enacted over the last one hundred years.",1

I like much of what you are for. Best to find a candidate that shares many of your beliefs. It's not Trump on most issues. I guess I read to many books, Tom Woods, I own three of his. But as a student of Austrian Economics, I agree with Dr. Paul, Peter Schiff, Tom Woods, Gerald Celente, and many others, that Trumps ideas on economics are a disaster.  At least from an Austrian School perspective. But he's certainly popular. It's my belief, sadly, I guess, that no matter who the next president is, little will change. I've learned too much on what some call the shadow government, and others call the deep state. It's my opinion that presidents are but puppets, controlled by people behind the scenes, The last to try to take the country back from them, JFK, didn't live to achieve it. I think Reagan tried, but, after he was shot, those promises from the campaign, were shelved. Murray Rothbard wrote some great articles on Reagan, and Tom Woods had a good section in his book, The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History  on the Reagan years. Time will tell how all this turns out. I'm a follower of many who believe as I do, that the economy may collapse before the next election, and if that happens, who know what will come next.

I disagree on voting. With the electoral college, your vote, or my vote, means absolutely nothing. No State has ever been close to be lost, by one vote. If they get even close, then automatic recounts kick in. I hate Hillary, but do not vote lesser of two evils. I see both Parties as one. Both are controlled by the Military Industrial Complex, the Banksters, Big Pharma, Monsanto, AIPAC, and others. I can not defend Liberty or the Constitution by voting for any of those announced candidates at this time. Lew Rockwell has a post up on Trump going to the Zionist/Rothschild controlled, Israel, to meet with Nutinyahoo, who he calls a ""great guy."" I'm sure for most Americans, addicted to Fox News or Rush Limbaugh, this is great news. But for me, due to my learning on things beyond Presidents, it's a further sign that he is a sell out. He even states in this interview he is the most ""Militaristic.""  I'm just too educatated at this point on topic beyond the MSM. Best too you though, have a great day!",0

I understand that those issues are in the Constitution. I certainly understand that military defense is part of the Constitution and that it is necessary. I am all for having a strong military. However, being ""the most militaristic person there is"" in a time when we are very close to all-out WWIII is not comforting. Also, very little of the military activities we have pursued since WWII have been ""defense"" (as outlined in the Constitution). We have been aggressive and pugnacious. We have been a major cause of all the instability in the world right now. We need someone skilled in diplomacy to de-escalate things, not another pugnacious, aggressive, arrogant brute in the White House. 

My problem with Trump is that he is all about more surveillance of Americans, not less. The part of the Constitution that he seems to ignore is the Bill of Rights, except for the Second Amendment. He seems very comfortable with unconstitutional search and seizure. I haven't heard him say anything about repealing the 2012 NDAA that gives the govt power to arrest and indefinitely detain any American citizen without due process. He is also a fan of the Patriot Act. Those are the things I'm most concerned about. 

The immigration issue is important, but what will it be worth to be a ""secure"" American who has no freedom of speech and has not free press and has no freedom from illegal search and seizure and no right to due process?",0

You are so correct. This is why I see no point in voting for either of the two corrupt parties. The only real hope is in a 3rd party. This is a long way off yet. In my opinion, Trump sold out to them when he agreed not to run 3rd party. If he is nominated, the shadow government will pick his V.P. and most of his cabinet. The CFR, Bilderburgs, Tri Latteralists, etc. will control the agenda. But, trying to teach this to vfamily and friends, who, trust the corporate media [Fox ""News""] is hard. They get brainwashed.

As you know, prolonged heat certainly had to weaken (already very compromised beams). My partner is an engineer and he has explained the whole chain of events to me. The impact and the enormous weight of the jet plane would have weakened the beams considerably,  the intense heat for over an hour added to that --  And when the support starts to go, even if it's just at one end, or one side, the whole floor collapses. Consider also that these floors are mostly open space, with the integrity of all of the support beams being essential. The only thing that is somewhat surprising is that the building didn't fall sooner. The manner in which the buildings fell is also completely consistent with logic.  The enormous weight of each successive collapse would have caused a swift cascading downward and a building-up of unsupportable weight with each collapse. Some have questioned the smooth downward manner in which it fell but a structure like this, built as it was, would not fall to the side or fall apart, so to speak. It would drop as it did.  You may know an explosives expert who thinks this was a controlled collapse but the vast majority of experts and engineers do not. My partner is one of them.

I think he(Alex) knows that no Presidential candidate will agree with (or rather, has been awakened to) the many created events which have been sold as reality.

From what I have seen is that if you try to convince or convert a BinLaden 9/11 believer in a one hour interview, it will take up the entire hour.

As for the surveillance, it already exists - so why not use it to have a better record of the false flag events in the short term - as for turning it back is at least a medium term task if not a long term task.

That said, I do think Alex was using a flood light to project his hopes onto a reflective screen(Trump) and he likes what he sees but much of it is just the reflection of the flood light.

I don't think Alex is fake as much as blinded by fervent hope.
