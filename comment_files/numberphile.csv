You're not supposed to put cake in the refrigerator!,0
The fundamental problem is that birthday cakes are usually a social event where people expect similar slice sizes.,0
Cake is cake not a mathematical function,0
lol i  didnt think about beeing able to push the cake together,0
I was just crossing out redundant equation permutations on a proof of mine and it looked a lot like this. Putting lines through X's.,0
bruh,0
Impressive. It just goes to show what a group of scientists and mathematicians from Numberphile can discover for the first time.    ;),0
the pieces of the cake have no chance to get dry. I eat it... thats why they dont have a chance to get dry,0
the obvious way to skip all of that annoying situation is to eat the whole cake in one sitting,0
"The problem with this method is that your pieces all have different icing/cake ratios. The first slices will be bland with very little icing, and the final slices will be overly rich clumps of icing with small bits of cake attached.

A better solution would be to cut out normal slices but close it up around the cutout every time, leaving the opening on the other side where you don't get your cake from.",0
"""Gastronomic Pressure""
Never change, Numberphile.",0
I wanna eat a cake now!!!,0
"This is best left as a theory. The moment you take this to practicals, you will receive a practical whopping.",1
Everyone loves cake so much that Numberphile just HAD to make this video...,1
it annoys me that you keep putting the rubber band over and over again. just get rid of it.,0
"How does noone point out that the slices will be different? As you start cutting by the middle, the last slices will have a lot more frosting than the first ones, and that is much worse than having a dry slice",0
Does the way you cut the cake really matter...  i prefer triangles cause idk it looks better to me. But it doesn't really matter the cake is going to be gone within 1 hour anyways. It still goes into our mouths cause who doesn't like cake.,0
Cake? üç∞üç∞üç∞,0
wrong,0
"The problem I have with this is the rubber bands. You put the rubber bands on the cake then cut the cake with the bands still on them. Doing this it's inevitable to get tiny pieces of rubber band to break loose and embed itself in the frosting, this is especially so with a serrated knife. I'd prefer not to eat tiny pieces of rubber bands.",0
how is pushing 2 cake pieces together make it vacuum tight?,0
What is the formula for giving everyone equal amounts?,0
lol <3,0
"0:23 captions, okay, who put HTML¬†'i' tags in here?",0
What an utterly pointless science,0
Waste of rubberbands.,0
I thought the best way of doing it would be to slice the cake in half horizontally then take disc-shaped slices out.,0
I have to wonder why this is the most popular Numberphile video.,0
Am I a genius when I thought about the same solution?,0
and that's why we have cupcakes.,0
Or you could just eat all of the cake at once,0
"i always deal with the cake no more than 12 hours (doesn't matter how big it is), so .......",0
I'm desperate for cake right now.,0
I would just eat the whole cake,0
I'm hungry now. :(,0
"That method would be ideal for a cake with fondant icing (as shown in vid).  I wouldn't mess with buttercream or ganache frosting or a gateau cake , ummm what's wrong with covering it with cling wrap or putting it in an air tight container?",0
it isn't practical way at all,0
way too much trouble...unless you're cutting a $1000 cake or something,0
I would like to see you do that with a cream cake meaning the rubber bands lol,0
"I have a heart-shaped cake. If I cut it in half, I'll be heart broken. How sad üò•",0
if i cut my slices like shown in this video i would have diabetes by now,0
I will finish the whole cake for my birthday!,0
Someone has apparently never heard of Glad bags....,0
Your amount of cake slowly decreases...,1
What if i want to eat the whole damn thing,0
"uneven cake-to-icing ratios, people don't get equal pieces, you have to cut EXACTLY orthogonal, the rubber band is gross and would not work anyway, cake doesn't dry out if you COVER IT, makes the leftover cake look ugly and unappealing, ... would you like me to go on? Terrible idea. Get a square cake if you want a square cake.",1
now i am craving for the cake bye :D,0
"Cake sellers should advertise this method since you now don't need a special event for cake, you can now eat cake regularly without it becoming hard and crumbly. On the other hand this will be terrible for the public health.",0
Does this work on other flavors of cake?,0
When u gonna push the cake pieces together...icing is gonna mess up...i would prefer eating it all alone.,0
fire this guy,0
"Call me genius please... 
Before he betrayed the solution, I came up with the idea.
14 million views for this simple logical thing?",0
but it's gonna work only for clay cake,0
Rubber band = bad cake,0
or you could just eat the whole thing like me.....?,0
He went to my school,0
hahahaha interesting way but I have to say most people don't care about whether cake's side is dry.,0
Ain't nobody got time for this!,0
First thing I thought was to cut down the middle and push it together.,0
"i dont think this is a problem for anyone in the world my friend , i disappear cakes for example",0
Who's going to do that? I thinks that's the slowly way to cut it! You need to be more productive and fast!,0
I lost five minutes of my fucking life,0
HAHA ! It doesn't work at all unless you have big rubber band which would definitely break your cake if it is a bit softer than this one. And who buys a cake and eats only one part of it ? Nobody !,0
Plastic wrap was invented for this reason,0
"All these supposedly there is any cake left to cut the next days :P.
I mean, who keeps a cake more than a day uneaten?",0
I would eat it all in one day LOL,0
"Œ§Œπ ŒºŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ∫ŒØŒµœÇ ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ±œÖœÑŒ¨ œÅŒµ œÜŒªœéœÅŒøŒπ; Œ§œÅœéœÑŒµ Œ≠ŒΩŒ± Œ∫ŒøŒºŒºŒ¨œÑŒπ œÉŒÆŒºŒµœÅŒ±, Œ≠ŒΩŒ± Œ±œçœÅŒπŒø; Œ¶ŒõŒ©Œ°ŒüŒô",0
On the basis all cakes are firm enough to be pushed together and hold by a rubber band : sadly the answer is no. Maths are cool but not always practical.,0
"I don't believe in climate change, nor this scientific nonsense cake cutting. Science is just something made up by liberals to push their agenda. Ha, in my world one plus one does not equal two. That's liberal propaganda. (Sadly, this is not too much of an exaggeration of how many people think, or don't think.)",0
I don't see the great revelation.  The second that I saw the post about this video this solution occurred to me.  It's not that I am so smart.  The solution is just so trivial.,0
"this assumes that optimality for cakes is measured in longevity - or consistent ""gastronomic pleasure"" over time. One could argue that equal portions with equal amounts of icing is another measure of optimality. And as many here point out,¬† the latter is a better social and party-themed objective function than the former which just makes one seem lonely and creepy.",0
Instead of doing all that work--simply put a piece of plastic over any exposed area--problem solved--no stale cake.,0
NO thank you.,0
or have a pastel de tres leches it'll always stay moist,0
Happy Birthday but how many times did you touch that cake with your fingers and palms? Yuck! Also where had those rubber bands been prior to wrapping around cake. Looks like cake did not have typical butter cream frosting. Cake could still be cut in fashion you demonstrated but maybe with a little less handling.,0
"It's me again, I was wondering if the mathematician that ""invented "" this cake slicing method in 1906 was the same guy that invented slicing a round pizza up and down and left to right to form squares pieces? Was he eventually committed?",0
"After viewing this video it appears to me that as the cake is sliced the sliced get progressively smaller. Although i agree with the idea of keeping the cake moist over a few days, there are other ways of achieving this (plastic wrap on each side?). There has to be a better way where all slices are of the same size for the entire cake. If restaurants sliced round cakes using this method I would not want to pay full price for a smaller slice near the end of the cake just because it was kept moist by some mathematical slicing method! I want my money's worth! But thanks for sharing, it was certainly a learning experience about round cake slicing and something I have never seen before. I bake cakes at home and I think the solution for keeping every last bit of cake moist over a few days is to bake square or rectangular cakes and slice them using the same method in the video. Problem solved. Cheers from the USA.",0
cake cutting for perfectionists :D,0
please give me back the 2 minutes i wasted on this.,0
"I knew this, ...but...cake shouldn't get to day 3...!!!",0
"As an executive chef of over 20 years I would like to say to all the "" food "" people that do videos like this STOP, please just stop...Not how to cut a round¬†cake and anyone that has ever worked a wedding as a caterer¬†would tell you that.",0
Another liberal trying to tell people what to do. Just cut the damn cake any way you want and eat it.,0
This is why no one wants to go to parties thrown by mathematicians!  A proper cake won't last more than a few minutes guys.,0
watched this to prepare for my bday tomorrow :p,0
"This works as long as you cut even number of pieces out of the cake. But what if, for example on day two, you want three pieces (not 2 or 4)? It's of course not a big deal, but because this gentleman claimed he is using science in his method, then he has to offer a solution for the exceptions two. Otherwise, it is a scientific method which works only sometimes and fails in all other cases.",1
After 3 days in a row no cake for me lol,0
that is the best way to cut a cake if you are not going to finish it.,0
"This is definitely not the ""mathematically perfect"" way to slice a cake, as the cake-to-icing ratio changes as the cake gets smaller. Cutting it the normal way, in triangles, makes sure every slice has the same cake-to-icing ratio.",0
What if you have a square cake?,5
"Pues en mi pa√≠s se acaba todo el pastel, y si sobra se guarda en tupperware. Que casi nunca sobra. jaja",1
i feel like disliking purely cause it made me hungry,0
that's great!,0
"If you still have cake left over from the previous day, I'm doubting it was a delicious cake to begin with.",2
I've actually seen this in an old tv show. Except the person used this method to hide the cake he stole.,0
I've tried out this way in my sponge cake and it was a complete disaster. this way only applies for a coherent cake like brownies .,1
"What if you don't have a cake that's as neatly prepared as this guy's? What if you don't want icing all over the place? What if a slightly dry cake is actually great, because it let's the flavours to meld and mature?",0

Running out of ideas?,2
I can't remember the last time I bought or baked a whole cake. Only only eat it by myself one slice at a time.,0
I thougth this video was going to be how to divide cakes in odd numbers precisely =(,0
The problem with this clip is that I don't think you named the inventor. And the problem with the method is that you get differing size slices each time. You can adjust for that by increasing the width of the band as you proceed outwards but you're always going to be faced with either a very large of very thin slice on day one.,0
just use a tupperware !,1
The problem with this analysis is that it assumes there is any cake left to put into the fridge.,29
nowadays bday cakes are not eaten .. they all become nasty in friends faces,0
13 464 104 views not bad,0
This is diabolically genius,0
Brilliant!,0
"First way is also bad because judging to the center point is likely to be inaccurate so even if you then get equal distance slices apart, they won't be equal size as each point will get more/less towards center of cake.",0

THAT RUBBER BAND IS IRRELEVANT,0
I like harder cake tho :(. I don't want the inside to be so soft D:.,0
I'll stick with the traditional way.  Leave to somebody to complicate a simple task.  This video did it.,0
Well the traditional way work because you share the cake with other ppl. With this method different ppl get different size pieces. That would end friendships from where I'm from.,6
Nope... not enough frosting for each person,0

"4:42 ""I think for the um.. mathematical loners, who don't want to share their cakes, it could be useful"".. -_-",0
Infinite cake?,0
The really UN-mathematical thing about this method is trying to evenly distribute individual slices to party guests. It'd be quite hard to give everyone an equal slice with this method. The traditional way suits me!,21
Thanks for making math fun!,0

"Oh wow, before the guy said the way to cut the cake, I was thinking of that method :P",0
"I haven't even finished this video yet, but the reason you cover your cake before putting it in the fridge is so it DOESN'T get dry. Would save you a lot of trouble if you did that.",0
"well, yes but the advantage of the usual way to cut cake is the equality of each piece. still nice.",0
"And here I though he was gonna talk about ""GABRIEL'S CAKE"" and cut it infinitely",3
The cake to icing ratio on the last slices would be bad,56
The best way you have to eat all the cake without letting it becoming dry and horrible is to eat it all in the same day :),0
dry cake best cake,0
I wouldnt eat this cake after the first slice because he use his dirty hands on it to put it all together....,2
This is brilliant!  How FUN!,0
"Well, you wouldn't cut just one slice for one person (birthday party), unless you'd be celebrating your birthday by yourself... Lonely  and sad.",0
"Scientifically...I would have to disagree. Cutting a circular cake in what is known as the pie or triangular shape; allows for each slicing to have a better balance of more icing in collection to the slice of cake, giving an equal amount of extra icing for each person.  It also allows the cake to stand upright Note...the cake not drying out is why they created cake covers. Who would leave out an uncovered cake? I don't even think I would eat a cake that was left out uncovered. a piece of wax cooking paper placed on the exposed piece of the cake would also be helpful.",0

"Who eats a cake alone?I think usually cakes are nearly finished the same day they are bought :D

"At a social event its nice to have all the slices the same size so you can distribute it evenly. 
At a personal event you cut a cake on an off-centered point, resulting in slices of different sizes. This is so people who want more can get a bigger slice and people who want less still have a nice wedge instead of a really long and thin slice",0

Haha this is how my dad cuts watermelons.,0

stopping the vid and thinking about a possible solution for about a minute I came up with the first part of the solution. then I would have carried on in the same manner which would have turned a round cake more and more into a sort of egg-shape. the basic effect would have been the same. - wasnt really a big deal (I am no mathematician - but obviousely very interested in math),0
"I found this video extremly wrong, who the heck leaves left over cake?",0
This is why mathematicians are never taken seriously by the general public.,73

This method is only applicable in fondant cakes. Soft cakes with buttercream frosting will just stick on your hand when you push the cakes together.,1

Esta wea vale callampa,0
"Yes but the wedge method is still superior because it will keep a constant icing to cake ratio. This method, although it will keep the cake fresher (implying you don't have cling wrap) will have more and more icing as you cut it. This results in an unsatisfying first piece and a way too sweet last piece.",3
"i came here for knowledge, instead, i got hungry.",1
"It's is scientifically proven, that the best way is to eat all at once.",2
Hmmm. Answers to questions nobody was asking?,0
"Hahaha, the Grapes of Math! How awesome. This video is so much fun! I would think with some cakes, you could just smear the frosting over the slice and keep it even fresher (clearly Americans like softer icing).",0
2:08,0
Just eat the damn oranges,0
just cut 1mm from the bottom every day :D,0
the scientific way might not be the most effective way... coz... each passing day.. ur piece of slice is going to decreases by a certain significant percentage... and why would you want to do that?,0
"Interesting. If, you'd like to stick with tradition and have a moist cake, just place a bit of plastic wrap over exposed area and place cake in a cake¬†tin and skip the rubber bands.",0

No...the perfect way it to just finish it.,0
I prefer the old way,2

So a birthday cake is meant to last several day ? give me a break. Usually mine wont last 30 minutes.,0

"NO. No, no no, no, no. You do realise that cutting the cake this way will inevitably result in much harder ""HIS IS BIGGER"" discussions where you'' have a much harder time convincing your children that YOUR slice is not larger than theirs.",0
"I might try a variation of this next time I serve a cake, just to see how people react. I have to say, though, I don't know why you would want to eat a cake covered in fondant... doing this with a frosted cake (for the purpose of keeping it moist) just wouldn't work.",0
I really think this is useless if you're having a cake that doesn't have a sugar cover. How would you wrap an elastic band around a chocolate cake? You'd make a mess and ruin the biscuit.,20
I'll just eat the whole cake in one day lol,0
That cake looks good,5
This makes me want cake now.,0
You need some very stable and not creamy cake for this. This on video was only two dry crusts and a bit of filling,0
"So what happens if ever you have friends (which is kind of realistic, even for scientists) ? Only the first guest is well served, the other ones have smaller portions, in fact the later they get served, the less they eat !",0
"First, cakes aren't always prepared to be eaten solo. Secondly, birthdays naturally occur in a day, cakes are rapidly consumed. Third, if cakes are sliced like in the manner shown, the cuts are still cuts and can't be addressed by bringing all the sides together again. Fourth, how about round gelato cakes? Fifth, you can't do this in a classic round, multiple-layered wedding cake, sir.",0
Who eats one slice of cake a day? Seems like you need some friends to share cake with.,0
Im gonna eat all of a birthday cake. ok!,0
But what if the cake is creamy and then you're gonna get all the frosting all over your hands by pushing them together! and those rubber bands will stick in it and it will be messy! aINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT,0
Scientific? Science has nothing to do with this. This is for people who enjoy eating week-old cakes.,9
"Cutting in triangles is much practical, and less messy and get you equally sliced pieces, and if you forgot to glad wrap it or put it in a box, then just slice that dry half cm away of both sides and enjoy the rest.",1
Why didn't you use electric saw? :P,0
"You are completely conkers. 1) why would you get frosting all over your hands by pushing the pieces together? 2) Why would you get the outside of your cake all messed up and frosting everywhere by using the rubber band? 3) Your cakes have fondant on the outside, not frosting which is the ONLY way you can do 1&2.¬† Besides everyone knows (obviously besides you and the person who wrote the editor in 1909) that when you cut a cake and you are putting away the remaining cake, you cut a piece of parchment or wax paper and place it on the cut side. This will keep the cut sides of the cake from getting dry.",16
who eats cake in more than one day,0
"Other than the cake cut with licking fingers, I don't mind eating any cake :P",0
HAHAHA CAKE FOR ANTS,0
the message: eat the entire  cake the same day tysm,1
"This might be satisfying for mathematicians, but a physicist will point out that the rubber band will stretch when put in a cool refridgerator. Thus the effect of the rubber band is nullified, and you've opened up for up to 4 times as much surface area exposal than what you tried to get away from when simply slicing out a wedge.

A potentially more satisfying way would be to simply chop disks from off the bottom of the cake.",216
Very nice to know that I've been cutting a cake the right way all along :),0

Nobody eats its cake for more than 2 days. It is not fresh enough after 2 days.,0
Meanwhile plastic wrap was invented.,0
"Day four,no more rubber bands...",0
This method works best for personal cakes that may take a while to finish. Nice that it keeps it moist. The traditional way works well with large groups who often eat majority or all of the cake right away.,7

I found a bug in this cut-method ^^

I'm sorry but who gives a f#$%...,1
"Who eats a cake by themselves? This is stupid, just eat most of the cake at the party and then wrap it up. Simple.",1
"This is a fail in practical application. If you are a person who buys a birthday cake for yourself and eat it alone, you have more psychological problems than how to keep residual cake fresh. Buy a birthday cupcake instead. Otherwise, with sufficient friends, you should have no residual cake or have chosen to sent it on with a friend. In America, those nasty fondant covered fruit bricks are not birthday cakes. A lovely buttercream or whipped cream frosting usually has enough residual decoration, roses and the like, to seal the open wound inflicted on the cake. A frosting transplant. Again, in reality, I proffer that those extended exposed internal surfaces are not truly sealed with the rubber-band and fondant. and that the cake as ""scientifically"" cut would actually stale much quicker. However it is a lovely geometry problem.",32
"Sure, that works if your cake has frosting that a rubber band won't cut through. The inside of the cake will be the lest of your problem.",0
i have a feeling that those rubber bands won't work on ice cream cakes...,0

but... you just cover the cake with plastic wrap,0
"Their 'scientific' cake cutting fails to take into account a requirement for even distribution of icing or fair sharing of the nicer, moist-crumbed centre portion of the cake. The wedge cut became popular for a reason! Just wrap the damn thing up.",0

"seriously.. have you heard of cling wrap? plastic wrap, glad wrap? a box with a lid?",180

or you finish the damn cake straight away instead of leaving it in the fridge!,0
"This is stupid. 
He spent just as much  time grabbing that rubber band to seal the cake closed as you would to grab some tinfoil or cling wrap and cover the corner of a conventionally cut cake. 
Makes the whole thing pointless. 

Also, holy shit I've never watched a video with so much filler! Cut the god damn cake!",2
"""for the mathematical loners who don't want to share their cakes""

HAHHAHAH",0
"I wouldn't say this is the ""right"" way or even an efficient way of cutting cake.
I have a sense that the rubber bands will not work on a cake with soft icing, such as whipped cream. Also, why would you leave food uncovered in the fridge in the first place? Have it covered by a lid or store it in a box or wrap it it plastic foil and it won't get dry so quickly. 
And is it really that bad if one side of a piece of cake is dry? That's like 1% of the cake that's dry. 99% of the piece is still fresh. Just shove that thing in your mouth.
If you don't expect to eat it in one, two, or three days, eat/buy a smaller cake.

Apparently scientists don't realize that smashing parts of a cake together and putting rubber bands around it will ruin the cake.,1
"Halfway mark of the video I was like, ""Oh come on, tell us already how""

Also, this is very impractical for cakes with with softer cream-like kind of icing. It's very messy to clump the pieces towards each other. I think the reason why we traditionally cut our cakes that way is to distribute the cake and icing evenly for each serving.
I never encountered a cake in our house that'll last for that long anyway. Haha.",7

"No, No, NO, the second cut allows way too much air into the cake bits - actually TWICE as much air, as the first cut. You can't contribute MATH to cake freshness, the relationship does not ""compute"" . You either have a perfect mathematically cut cake - OR a perfectly cut cake with the most fresh ends. Simply pushing the cake together does NOT stop air from enveloping the cake cut surface. After all you did not make an ""air tight"" connection with the two halves. Now cutting again DOUBLES the amount of air hitting even more sq. centimeters of cake. I can cause LESS air to envelop the surface by wrapping the cake in plastic wrap, where as your method delivers and endless supply of fresh air to the cut cake surface. So in conclusion a piece of plastic wrap on the ""traditional"" cut works far far better than this ""new math cut""",4
Get a better food storage container and then you'll be good to go.,1
This only applies if you want to eat the cake by yourself in several days. If you just distribute it between people and finish it in 1 day this doesn't apply. And the first method is easier for distribution.,0

"Having your cake and eating it too! It is really a good idea. Let's say a family is having a cake one night and cut it the ""scientifically correct way"" then a couple of days later just cut it whatever way seems most fair. It is a revolution in cake eating. For single people - they will have to choose a compromise a diminishing cake to frosting ratio or cutting their cake old school while alternating sides for less dryness. If non of these compromises can lead to satisfactory cake eating then I guess math will have to give way to craft and crafty storage warping...I guess my point is let me get to that cake already.",0

"The solution seems perfect, but the third day we get into a fairness problem if we want to minimize the number of cuts and thus the degradation of the cake.

Supposing two people share, theyr do not get equal sizes the third day and this may cause a great deal of disagreement.

Also, if the number of persons sharing the cake is not 2 or 4, the system doesn't work, so I would suggest that if an odd number of people share the cake, one should use the method of x angle slises where x = 360/n.

Here's what's wrong with it though.¬† You are increasing the ratio of icing to cake with every slice.¬† If you cut radial wedges (the ""classic"" way) you get an equal ratio for every piece.¬† But your method starts with very low icing-to-cake ratio (as the size of the cake approaches infinity, the ratio of the first slice's ratio¬†approaches the ratio of the thickness of the icing to the thickness of the cake), and continuously increases as the cutting continues, approaching¬†infinity.

I don't want to get one of those final 4 pieces that tastes like icing, rubber, and human¬†hands.",13

What does that do to the cake to frosting ratio. That is more important to me. It looks like it starts out with way too little amounts of frosting and eventually gets to be way to much frosting.

"TOO MUCH TROUBLE, THO' MAYBE SLICING WITH DENTAL FLOSS WOULD MAKE IT A SMOOTHER CUT....BUT I SAY, CUT IN WEDGES AND PLACE A SCOOP ON ICE CREAM ON THE DRY SIDE....(WINK)",0
Do you not have friends ... Why have a whole cake and not share it.,0
I came up with an even better method: Don't worry about cutting the cake at all and eat the whole thing at once. It's as fresh as it can be + you don't have to share.,0
Nice. You should also do a video on cake cutting algorithm.,0
I think it's really sad that you're eating your birthday cake by yourself :'o(,0
"Interesting mathematical information, but what is this sorcery of a cake lasting two days? Does it regenerate? Personally, I've never seen that prodigy of such a long-lived cake.¬†

Or maybe I just eat too much cake at one go. Maybe that's it.",0
I want cake now,0
"Think mathematically, do it unrealistically.",0
This is just silly. Who takes so long to eat a cake anyway?,0
"Love the video!

The real answer that occurs now is: How wide do I cut each part? I have this lovely strawberry chocolat cake with a diameter of 20cm and I want to eat exactly 1/8 of the cake for 8 days in a row.",1
"I stopped trusting this video the minute they said ""when you leave the cake overnight""",0
"So this is the ""Perfect Way"", it cuts off the all the fun of eating and looking the wedges:)¬† Besides, how long does it take for all the guests waiting this to be done before they can taste the cake?",0
Ewww...rubber bands on your cake!¬† Oh I mean elastic bands.,0
Genius!,0
"This could work for a cake with very thick icing or marzapan, but how would you ""put together"" a black forest cake? Certainly you can't wrap a rubber band around it without destroying the outer icing/chocolate, and even more so when you try to ""put it back together.""",0
"That is fine for a ""fondant"" covered cake, but you cannot place rubber bands around a buttercream frosted cake or push it together like you did that cake.",0
stupid way of cuting cake,0
"Constructive Criticism: Interesting video but, you are AMAZINGLY long winded. Please please consider just getting to the point.",0
"Coupez-vous votre g√¢teau de la ""mauvaise fa√ßon""? :)",0
Or get a smaller cake so it finishes in 1 day,0
"If you're gonna use rubber bands and shit, why don't you just cut the cake the traditional way, and wrap it in plastic foodstuff foil? That way you get uniform slice volume, and a lot less hassle. Just saying.",0
Assuming freshness is your priority. I would prefer to have the same amount of cake each day.,0
Grabs a chunk with hand and eats,0
Good Video !!!,0
"I put my cake in a cake carrier, always soft and delicious.¬† If I don't have access to my carrier, then I use some plastic wrap against the open sides.
The method in this video will not work with soft frosting, like butter cream.",1
This is like that video that insisted I was making my PB&J sandwiches incorrectly...... IT MY DAMN SANDWICH I WILL MAKE IT THE WAY I WANT,0
"Or you could just buy a Tupperware cake container. I guess they didn't have those in 1906. This isn't even really practical. You have this ginormous first slice which is difficult to retrieve intact. Then you have to shove the two halves of the cake together, getting whatever horrible contagion you might have on your hands¬†all over the cake. This also seems to be highly reliant on the cake having some sort of armored shell on it, as opposed to any sort of soft icing. All I can say is, hooray for 21st century cake technology.",0
that legend!,0
Is it just me that the sound isn't working for?,0
"ok so I have to disagree on this. the problem with these long square pieces is that the ratio of cake to icing on each slice is no good. Not enough icing!! Not enough outer surface area on each slice. (until you get the last edge pieces where you will have too much icing and not enough cake)
Hence, why the triangular slices! perfect cake to icing ratio!¬†
just buy some plastic wrap and cover it! LOL",0
This would never happen in my house. There would never be leftover cake.,0
I will be using this method!,0
How sad is to eat alone... But some people like that way...,0
Interesting. ¬†This is the exact same method I use to cut up people I don't like.,0
"If I cut the cake like this on my birthday, my entire family would probably be yelling at me at soon as they see me make the first cut.",0
Use plastic wrap. Then you're cake will stay fluffy,1

Pretty AWESOME!,0
"Everyone knows Brits can't cook or bake worth a $#*+ so no wonder your cake is awful. Get a slice from dessert gallery. Stays moist for days. Cut or no cut. 

Also, who doesn't share their cake???",0

As√¨ la torta se mantiene fresca!!!,0
"This cake is a lie!

Interesting method btw.",0
Or.. you just eat the whole cake the same day,0
"That's bullshit, the third cut make a half of the cake bigger than the other, thus making a part of it dry, but if you keep dividing the angle, it will not.",0
"The grapes of math, great title because everybody knows people like grapes.",0
"Stupid cut. No cake would remain at frŒπdge for 2 or more days. I want to eat, not to do math.",0
"I grew up not cutting it in wedges, we always cut them in half vertically,¬†and then cut the half into horizontal pieces that way it feeds more ppl. AND you could always just put the cake stand cover over the cake and leave it on out the dining room table.",0
Or... don't buy a whole cake and just eat one piece..buy enough cake so that you don't have a ton left..and what is left..put in tupperware or cover with cling wrap. A very cool method though.,0
Wouldnt the cake get old after like day five or something?,0
"and... lest we forget, depending on what kind of frosting or rubber band or how soft the sponge of the cake is (which the rubber band may cut into), who enjoys the taste of rubber along with their sweet? The thought is there, I see it, especially that yes, the cake does dry in the conventional cake cut but sadly there's too many cons with this method. I personally am a fan of the dental floss method.",0
But but but... then not everyone gets an even-sized or icing-covered slice :(,0
Is this a troll video?,0
cling wrap...,0
You guys are totally crazy. I love it. And now you're stars !,0
Just eat the whole fucking cake!,1
This is the kind of trivial B.S. that my mother and aunts used to waste my time talking about.¬† I'd go outside and join the men's conversations because I was bored out of my mind.,0
"i dont know how YOU store your cake, but the sides that were exposed to air for a day are never dry and nasty on any of our cakes.",0
This only works with boring cakes with no chocolate or cream icing and with boring people who do not share cake and leave it in the fridge way too long.,0
This is actually the way i cut my cheese,0
"We been cutting the classic way and we have a cake holder, glass bottom and metal cover, and we never had a problem with freshness. So we really don't care what the ""scientific way"" is, can you put a rubber band on the creme frosty icing or even whipped creme style frosting? Wouldn't that get your hands all messy in the first place? Oh no coarse you didn't think of that with your ""scientific way"" of thinking cause apparently y'all think everything and everyone should be the same and doing everything the same way don't ya?",0
Happy birthday Brady. Glad to see your cake was cut correctly.,0
"Halfway through the video i was thinking this is so for the lifeless and forveralone people, and then at the end he mentioned it. lol.",0
Use clingfilm bro,0
I like the idea....but a rubber-band around a cake?..... Really?...Really? I don't think that would work out as well as this video seems to say!,0
Try pushing the cake together that's covered in buttercream instead of fondant.,0
"simple solution

stick it in a blender",0
"Well, a problem is present when you have not so solid icing on the cake. Its a mess waiting to happen.",0

What happens when your cake has icing on it? You would make a mess! And would people eat your cake after touching it over and over again? And after putting rubber bands on it?,0

"This video was shown on a brazilian tv show (they, unfotunatly, didn't talk about math) you're famous around here!",0
"Dang it, stop cutting the rubber bands! They have feelings too, you know!

Also, it's just kinda wasteful.",2
Who cuts cake? The correct way to eat a cake is to do so all in one sitting.,71
"I've cut a cake like that before. Seemed obvious to me. Also, YouTube, please stop moving on to other videos while I'm typing a comment!",1
Am I the only one who was craving cake after this video ??,0
Just cover it in plastic wrap :),0
Gotta be a lonely party to only have one piece eaten!!!,0
"This is NOT the best way to cut a cake, if moistness is your only concern. From the 3rd slice of cake on, using the previous cut going the same direction would result in having uneven ""quarters"" left after taking a slice. ¬†If your slice is only on the right side of the cake, the ""quarters"" remaining after taking your piece will be smaller on the right side, leaving the very top and very bottom of the left side uncovered. If this is repeated on the 4th day, assuming you turn your cake 90 degrees clockwise, you will, again, leave uneven ""quarters"", leaving the top and bottom of the left quarters unexposed, and easily dried out. Not only that, but the piece at the bottom right will be even smaller than before, so when you push the pieces in, the top right piece of cake will have the right edge exposed, and left for dry. this cycle will continue, leaving your cake as dry as it would have been had you cut triangles. If you want your cake to stay completely moist, you must make 2 centered, parallel cuts every time, giving you four pieces of cake for each ""slice"" you want. But who wants to go through that trouble? Triangles are the simplest, and simplicity is key.",0
"See, this is what you get when you make one video that the media actually gets",1
It's a bit irritating that numberphile has a lot of brilliant videos but the one that gets viral is a one about cutting cake... But I guess everyone loves cake :D,0
funny!good to know,0
"This cake is fondant. If it was icing, there's no way u can wrap a rubber band around it. That would be a total failure.",0

"Why is everyone surprised by the attention?
This is the only numberphile video mere mortals can comprehend.",0
"Make a square cake in the first place, problem solved.",0
"I like this in theory, but in reality this is completely impractical.¬† A rubber band around the cake to keep it together???¬† That would only conceivably work with very solid, rigid frosting, which is apparently what they have here.¬† I have never in my life had a cake with this kind of frosting.¬† It's always been very soft and squishy, in which case the elastic band would simply penetrate the frosting, embedding itself into the cake",0
I drew up a more efficient solution. Just eat the whole cake at once.,8

Why is this video so much more popular than most of numberphile's videos?,122
"I love how everybody misses the point of this video.. It's supposed to be a fun thing, not a practical thing.",0
"This may be theoretically slightly interesting, but also very silly. In fact it's so silly that it only deserves a silly comment. So here we go....
ONE: Nobody eats a birthday cake alone! Birthday cake eating only makes sense as a social activity, and usually all of it is eaten!
TWO: Should any of it be left after all, you will of course cover it with clingfilm before putting it into the refrigerator, so how you've cut it is totally unimportant.
THREE: There's a law against cutting cake in 'scientific' ways! The law is called tradition! You simply must cut it in the right way, and the piece must be standing up when it is served, not lying down - otherwise superstition will predict bad luck!
FOUR: Just imagine what it would do to pie charts if you cut them in your 'scientific' way! In danish pie charts are called layer cake diagrams, so NO WAY!",0
It's too bad you can't really use this for more than one person eating without giving wildly unfair portions to people.,0

So this is the video they were talking about on hello internet. Wish to have a chance to prove this but i fear a cake wont survive to the nexr day.,0
"So many things wrong in the premise of this video I don¬¥t know where should I even get started from.
1) Why should you eat your cake alone?
2) If you do want to eat your cake alone, you will get fat by having to eat a very large piece, or throw away half of it.
3) If you decide to throw away the half of it in the first place, just remove the exposed part that got dried in the traditional method in the first place.
4)However, who gets this problem of dried exposed part anyway? You don¬¥t want to store your cake in the refrigerator without a cover, being dry is the lessen of the problem, the bad refigerator-taste is the worst one. Just get a small plastic cover and voila
5) The cover is still the best option, because the bad-refrigerator-taste and dryness also affect the cover, specially it isn¬¥t a solid-sugared type one like this video. Which often isn¬¥t.¬†
6) What if I like the cover of the cake more than the middle part? A piramidal shape optimize cover eating. This also applies to those cakes with a dozen of Strawberries on top.¬†
7) Most of the time I just want to cut the piece of the cake unevenly, by the shape and size I want to eat at the moment.¬†
8) British food is already very bad, so british shouldn¬¥t nitpick about how they eat their bad cakes.",0
What if I only need one piece?,0
make square cakes,0
I really want cake,0
"Of course this is only useful if you intend to save cake for the next day(s) and really mind keeping it fresh and soft. Keep in mind you're wasting elastic bands and the pieces will be gradually shrinking, which wouldn't be a fair thing if you wanted to share a birthday cake in a party.

the real question is why are you eating your birthday cake alone?,370
Yeah but no. You can just put some saharan warp on it and the cake gonna be alright. And wtf? a triangle piece is much better than rectangular.,0
This is just terribad :D,0
Or you could just cover it...,0

"So...you have to cut a cake into uneven pieces that are very difficult to serve without the long, skinny piece tumbling off of your knife. Then you have to press the remaining cake back together, getting your hands on everyone else's slice, which could be very messy if the icing is fresh. Then you have to wrap a possibly unsanitary elastic band around the cake...and this is the ""scientific"" way because it prevents the exposed part of the cake from getting dry overnight (a problem which is easily solved with plastic wrap)?!

If you don't have any plastic wrap, then just cut off the dry part the next morning. Sure that's wasteful, but not any more wasteful than spilling a whole slice of cake that you're trying to balance on a long, skinny knife.",0
Have fun trying this with a traditional German cake or a whipped cream cake as it is common in Germany! It is far to soft and fluffy to be moved anywhere after its been cut! The result would be to smash it completely while trying ;),0
Just say YOLO and eat the whole cake at once. Easy.,0

Your cake is covered with frosting. The inside is like a sponge cake hence it's easy to slide it. Imagine a tiramisu cake or a really thick Choc fudge cake. U r going to mess the whole cake up.,0
"Really impractical mate, squish together a cake with cream and sprinkles and shit and get your hands all dirty and probably mush the cake. Yeah the classic way makes the outer side dry but you can simply cut that side off really thin and it becomes all fresh.",0
Yall got anymore of those shows for dumbasses?,0
"Or simply cut the traditional wedges and use a piece of plastic wrap to cover the face of the exposed cake, so no moisture escapes.

"In the early 1900, they made cakes that taste so bad they had to develop an algorithm on how to properly cut cakes.. cakes today taste so good that they won't even last an hour after serving..",0

"....ugh, another cake and another post).  3.  The best way to preserve equal wedges of cake is to slice remaining cake the traditional way, wrap each individual piece snugly with plastic wrap, then freeze them.

Cakes are already wrong in the extremely good to normal good taste ratio. See Allie Brosh from Hyperbole and a Half.,1
THIS. this is stupid,0
too much work for a god damn cake.,0
Yuck. The last few pieces are going to be mostly frosting. Mathematicians must have a lot of time on their hands. And cake too I guess. Who wants their cake all pushed around and mushed together? The thing at the beginning about the French cheese was interesting though.,0

"Or, you know, you could just seal the cake in a container (assuming there's any cake left, which is a big assumption). Plus, the rubber bands would ruin the frosting.",0

Seriously? Who leaves a cake in the fridge more than a day?,1
"If Alex has been ending up with dry cake I think that it's because he's been storing he's cake incorrectly. not the fact that he as been cutting it into wedges. If your going to store a cake, don't put into the ridge with out any wrapping around it. The fridge will dry out the cake on it's own. Secondly you should wrap cling film around the cake or put it in a cake tin. This limits the oxygen that gets to the cake and therefore stops the cake from going stale. Cutting wedges also has several benefits. 1) you can cut the cake into slices as big or as small as you like. The alternative method may result in cake being wasted as you are forces to cut a whole cross section of cake. 2) wedges ensures that everybody gets a piece of the middle of the cake ( which is the best part). the other method ensure only the first person(s) get the middle piece. Also this means that the last person get more of the outer edge of the cake which is normally dryer. 3) This method if done incorrectly will mean that more edges are left exposed an the cake will go stale even quicker.
I would stick with the traditional method, and leave it in a cake tin once sliced.",0

Any cake that has frosting hard enough to put a rubber band around and not make an impression is not fresh to begin with.

"Isn't this method incredibly unhygienic?

Ok, so cutting a cake in the traditional way and sticking it in the fridge will leave the exposed cake interior to bacteria, but at least we now have plastic wrap (or ""clingfilm"") to help with that.

This mathematical method has you constantly touching the surface of the cake. Even if you were to wash your hands before every cut, then there are the multiple elastic bands. Have you ever tried washing an elastic band?? It's practically impossible! I don't know...

"Well this is the engineer's optimized way of cutting a cake maybe, but I thought this would be about the problem of cutting a cake which is not circular in such a way that everyone gets the same amount of cake and the same amount of frosting. And I can tell you the answer, for a regular polygon, it doesn't matter how many sides it has, you DO make wedges to the center, and you give everyone equal perimeter slices. So if you start with a square cake and you have 5 people, if the cake is 12 inches on a side, you would mark out the perimeter in 9.6 inch intervals all the way around, and slice out from the center to the edge at those 5 points, and the resulting 5 pieces will all have the same amount of frosting (outside surface area) and the same amount of cake (volume). It works with any number of sides in the polygon and any number of people you share it between. But THIS, this isn't anything mathematical like THAT, THIS is just a practical method of keeping it as fresh as possible until you eat it.

This is a ""loner's guide"" to eating a cake all by yourself. A sad, lonely person who buys a birthday cake for himself and then eats it all himself, day after day. The REAL optimal way is as I described it, because the birthday cake gets eaten ON the friggin' birthday. Do you suppose the person this video is actually useful to also buys HIMSELF all his birthday PRESENTS too? Not much of a surprise, that.",0

Sure as heck beats having to man handle the cake with your hands.",0
"If you're really concerned about your cake getting dry and crusty, I'd question your storage methods before I'd question your cutting methods. This seems overly complicated, especially when you bring the (likely unsanitary) rubber band into the picture.

Just cover your cake like a normal human being and stop being a moron. Simple, isn't it? This is definitely not science.",0

"""For (mathematical) loners who don't want to share their cake"" - pretty much sums it up. I fail so see any ""mathematical"" brilliance in it, as the size gets smaller every two pieces.
The point of slicing it in wedges is to make each piece the same size, for sharing.
It would be better to meet your objectives if you from the start made a single long cake that you slice from the middle outwards and push the ends together.

OMG this is beyond stupid. I've been baking and selling cakes for close to 30 years and I have never used a rubber band. While there are many ways to cut a cake they are based on how many slices you would like to get. Wedding reception slices are smaller than dessert slices and so on. Also who the hell pushes a cake together? As for the first cake drying out all you got to do is take a grocery store plastic bag and stuff it in there.,0
I saw this on the news lol I think it's stupid they make cake stands with lids so the cake stays fresh. Not to mention how often do people make a cake at home with fondant? The rubber bands woukd just make a mess with regular icing.,0
"This assumes that you take several days to eat your cake bit by bit and therefore preventing staleness is your priority.

If you are sharing the cake between a group of people and expect to eat the whole thing in one day, the traditional wedge provides the optimum proportions of icing, sponge and filling. The ""mathematical"" method provides small pieces at the end with a disproportionate amount of icing.",0

wrapping the cut cake in plastic wrap works fine to keep it fresh. ¬†

and if you don't wrap it, the icing on the top will dry out/crust over.¬†

"No, this is the wrong way. It wastes too much cake or you eat too much of it if you want cake for one person. You just cut the traditional way and put cling film over the gap in the cake. Also, rubber bands would just slice into the large majority of cakes.

This might be the best way to cut a cake if:
A - You always want slices for more than one person (but only an even number) EVERY time you cut the cake (and that gets less likely if you're needing to cut a cake solely to keep it fresh over time).
B - It's a cake with hard icing.

damn! some things are just simple. leave it to these guys to¬†make anything simple complicated!,2
The rubber band technique would be awful on cakes that are not covered in fondant.,8
"Slice the cake in the classic way, and wrap it with plastic-wrap before i put it in the fridge, same moist cake.",0
"We don't ice a cake with fondant, unfortunately. Pretty nifty, though.",0
"Do British people not have cake covers? We just use cake covers and the cake stays pretty moist in the fridge. Or, you know, you could just share the cake.",0
Scientific way to cut a cake? Use a ruler as the knife! Lol,0
You could actually remove the rubber band before you cut the leftover cake and use the same one again.,0
ANDY SERKIS!,1
My life was a lie... and the cake's too,0
there is a reason for the cover lid of the cake,0
"Have you tested this vs. cling-film? If not I want to test it.

Alex does not know what saran wrap is,0
"Pretty sure this has probly been said, but doesn't it sort of rape the premise of efficiency to waste a shitload of one thing (i.e. rubber bands?) in order to accomplish one simple and menial task?",0
Theoretical impractical!,0
I like the frosting too much to get a piece from the middle. I'd wait till day 4 and take all for sides. : )~,0
im safe either way.. since i cant sleep if i have cake left in the fridge,0
"That way to cut a cake is for loners.... a fat one, may i say. ¬†lol ¬† sorry! ¬† Peace out!",0
I want to try this!,2
I thought about this. Cut it in the middle and push the large pieces together.,0
Its funny to watch but I think it will be silly to do that lol and I prefer the pie chart sharp lol,0
"Man, I thought the video was going about how to slice a cake easily into equal portions for tough or odd numbers like 7 or 11!
There would be so much more useful. Its a strong-willed man or woman who only eats 1 slice of cake.",0
Ummm that's y there r cake glass things,0
Or you finish the cake on day one,0
"DOESN'T WORK WITH REAL CAKES! I mean, cakes made without all that sugar fondant shit! God, that thing is so gross...",0
"I appreciate your advice to do this.... ¬†people would ask what the hell are you doing, and then come the explanation... and then they'll tell you to get the hell out.",1
"Over 2 million views and not one person will use this method....you know why? cause its no one cares, if it aint broke dont fix it. Sometimes to much thought to make something more ""right"" ¬†can make something very dumb. Cake is good no matter how you cut it. No one is going to rubber band a cake back together. P.s Sir Francis finds a different way to cut cake and he ones of Britain most brilliant scientist.....yeah, riiiight. Sounds like he had to much time on his hand or was high and came up with it while he had the munchies",2
To think... Most people would just use some cling film or put it back in the box... Those of us that are sad enough to buy a birthday cake and eat it alone over a period of days anyway.,1

so you suggest that from small portion of cake to bigger one. and getting fat even more faster. lol,0
He forgot about matching the angles of both cuts.,0
Better solution: buy a square or rectangular cake.,0
This ¬†video ended up on my news 0_0,0
so the common cake cut is a lie,0
dang,0
no audio..,0

Unless you cover it.¬†¬†¬† Cause god forbid you take 5 seconds to get some plastic wrap or have a cake dish with a cover.¬† Mathematical precision means nothing when it all becomes shit no matter how you do it.,3
Why can't you just cover cake with plastic wrap. This seems so pointless lol.,0
"If u worry so much about cutting the cake good or bad ways, your seriously wasting your time! Just cut n eat, it's that simple :)",11

"The best way to cut a cake is in a way where you have enought friends so you don't take care of this shit.

I mean... If you will not eat the whole cake, why you brought such a big cake in the 1st time?

Mathmatical!,0
"I don't believe I have ever stored a cake with a single wedge removed, usually it's much closer to half, and a bit of cling film seals that just fine. Also, we use actual frosting, not that fondant crap.",0

This video is 5 minutes longer than it should be.,1
"So in the end you may have a spongy cake, but at what cost? Dirty fingers or not, I prefer my cake to be pristine and untouched, rather than gutted over like this. Also, I noticed he is eating a fondant cake. He clearly has absolutely no taste at all, if he thinks that stuff is moist. LOL",0
thats coo i will us that thanks,0
Why¬†not put the cake in an air¬†tight container. That way you don't have to use elastic bands and you can cut it like everyone else.,0
"At the time this theory was made there were no fridges nor containers.. I have never noticed ""dry edges"", are you storing your cakes in your yard?",2

I just came for the cake,0
"Great works for hard, fondant cakes; not so efficient for soft, frosted cakes.",0
I just eat cakes in one sitting. Problem solved.,0
"Not all cakes can be wrapped with that rubber band thing you know lol and if the cake was iced all the way around how in the hell are you gonna push the two sides together huh? if you're worried about the cake being dry (from the wedge cut) then you're just storing it wrong. 

We always have cakes at home and we automatically cut them into 8 slices (pizza style lol) and it never becomes dry or anything when we eat it again the next day.",1
my cakes never do that,0
WHOLE TIME I WAS THINKING EATING OF THAT CAKE!!!,0
"Just a thought here but¬†can't you just put a lid on the cake after cutting it anyway you want? if you want to save fridge space, just cut it up, place in Tupperware and I think you're good to go.

well here in america we don't take more than one serving to eat all of our cake,0
"Since you're having a smaller slice everyday, can this be qualified as a diet?",0
You people SERIOUSLY need to get a life.,0
why save it for next time when you can eat the whole cake :o,0
It is a birthday cake and there's only one slice cut per day... You guys are so fucking lonely!!!,0
surely that mathematician died of diabetes and loneliness,0
I'm glad Britain is good for something.,0
"If the cake survives till the day three, you'rde doing something wrong",1
ye ive always put rubber bands on my cake!,0
It seems a bit shit as who's cake looks like that? ¬†The frosting doesn't look like frosting and who want's to reset or move the cake inwards? ¬†That could ruin the whole thing. ¬†Why not just keep some extra frosting and frost over the parts that wouldn't normally be as fresh or just cut off the dried out part?,0
this reminds me of the video about how we should not shake hands and fistbump instead,0
"Good point, lol. Second how important is this? and third, this allows the chance to put germs on it by using your hands to place the cake together each time.",0
The cake is a lie!,0
so fucking useless,1
Some cakes are creamier so... we'll be ruining the cream. But will definitely do it this way next time,0
"And what if I told you that most people finish their cakes(on birthdays,etc) in one day :O",1
Aint got time for that -___-,0
pointless,0
"But what if I want just ONE regular slice? Ever think of that, nerds?",2
So the cake and its slices just get smaller and smaller but never end.,0
"I think the best way is to use an axe as the cuts will be perfectly clean. Sometimes the surface tension will cause it to cave in a bit and adds crumbling. Another way is a circular blade, but that's risky unless the rpm is high enough as it can also cause crumbling.",0
"I never knew that the center became ""hard"" if kept opened after cutting it triangular style. Maybe I just never noticed the difference because I just eat the cake lol. I mean, as long as it's not 100% dry or hard as a rock, I think it's fine. But other than that, interesting idea. :P I might just try it just to confuse my family xD. ""What the heck are you doing? That's not how you cut a cake!"" xD LOL.",0
Who saves cake for the next day? Once I cut and eat the first piece I can't stop.,0
Or..you could just cut it the regular way and put it in an air-tight container for storage.,0
or you can just by a cake cover to keep it fresh,1
so you end up with a cup cake?,1
"or you can just cut the only middle portion, then if you want more, cut two extra slices, eliminating the need to cut perpendicularly to the other perpendicular angle.",0

This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Your cake has fingerprints all over it and the elastic  cut up the sides. The elastic didn't even hold the cake together. You can't easily cut two slices in a row. The first piece and the last piece have completely different cake to icing ratios.

"or you eat the whole cake on the first day .. no problems.

That was a total waste of time. The pieces aren't equal---at least they can be made so if desired by the traditional way. Our cake doesn't go in the fridge. It stays in a covered cake container and stays moist. And---the rubber band thing only works if the icing is as hard as a rock. Who wants their cake handled over and over?,0
The only way this video succeeds is if it serves as a demonstration of how things in theory can easily be trumped by reality.,7
why not just eat all the cake?,0

This is only useful if you don't want equal size slices (AKA you have no friends or family to share with) and if you are not going to eat it all in one day. First time I'm not agreeing with a Numberphile video but I don't think this is very practical.,1
Who has time for this when u just wanna eat your cake hahah,0
I'm sorry but I don't think it's practical to cut a cake like that and then use a rubber band later to put it together. You can probably apply this to fondant cakes (which is like the ones shown on the video) but not on icing covered cakes and chiffon cakes. You can't really use a rubber band on them because it will mess up the icing. This video seems like a joke for me.,0

You may have preserved some cake but you certainly did not preserve those rubber bands!,1

"I can see several flaws with this system.

One: You get your hands all over the cake when pushing it together.¬† And nobody wants that.
Two: Not all cakes are like this.¬† Larger round cakes with small knives would not be able to be cut this way, and large square or rectangular cakes would not effectively be able to be cut this way without issue.

"There are several problems with this:
1. Your method only works with fondant, which also explains why you have any leftover cake to begin with because it sucks
2. The slices won't be even, which will cause rioting and bloodshed in most parties

4. Rubber bands will transfer their horrible taste to the cake and they'll destroy a cake with a frosting other than fondant
In conclusion, don't use fondant and you'll never have leftover cake :)",2

"I have 2 great math problems with cake.
1. With only 3 complete slices how can you make 8 pieces the same size.

2. ""I CUT YOU CHOOSE"" is a great way to share a cake because the person cutting the cake has an interest in making the 2 pieces the same size because the person choosing will always will pick the bigger piece , there-by making a far system so no one can complain about size.
Now try it with 3 people??? what is a far system.
This is a good challenge for someone at Numberphile",0
"But you still get diminished enjoyment of the cake from getting smaller pieces. You also have to consider other factors like the ease of removing the cake slices without breaking up, and varying cake to frosting ratio. The classic is still best in terms of practicality.

"Firstly, who requires several days to finish a tiny cake? Eat it faster, or invite friends to your birthday party.

Secondly, this is a stupid way to cut a cake, because promotes moistness at the expense of literally everything else: you need a longer knife, it takes longer to cut, it's harder to take the pieces out, the pieces are all different shapes and sizes, you require a bunch of (dirty) rubber bands, and on top of all that, everyone will think you're a douche",0

This looks stupid. usually we slice in the normal way cus there so many ppl who at the party. its easy to take out etc. and if there are leftover cus the cake is really very big u can always use the box that come with the cake to cover and put in the fridge =_=,0
"I have to say that that is a stupid way of cutting a cake. If you want to keep the cake fresh after eating, what you can do is just cut through the side of the cake, lift the top portion, and then set it aside to eat on the next day while you eat the bottom portion of the cake. If you follow the instruction in the video, there is just no way that butchered pieces of cake will hold together after 2nd day. Also, most of the cakes I have eaten so far had creams on the side, so holding those cakes using a rubber band is not an option; the band will cut through the cream and possibly cut through the whole cake over night.

At first he thought he needed 28x29=812 slices but his wife informed him that he was being an idiot.

I'm sure that's fine if you're the only one eating the cake for some reason.,0
"not to blow a big whole in this, but 1, that works on very few types of cakes, because if you try to squeeze them together you will have a mother or pastry chef killing you for messing up there cake or the cake will just be crushed, 2 cling film and airtight box, it's not hard, it's used all the time, 3 portion sizes you have none, it might be scientific but if you don't see Heston or El Bulli doing it, then it's a really dumb idea",0

"Absolute bullshit. Who the hell leaves cake for day 2/3/4? Some forever alone guy maybe. And you most probably have some tupperware boxes to put it in keeping it fresh.

Yes, except you put it back in the cardboard/plastic container that you purchased it in that will keep it from drying out or touching other things. ¬†Who stores exposed food in the fridge? ¬†Besides, this¬†would only work with cakes that have that fancy edible covering commonly used in weddings or competitions, but not commonly used for the average birthday or other holiday. ¬†Good luck sliding two halfs of a soft moist cake covered with regular frosting together and rubberbanding it.",24

If I was that desperate for a dessert I think I would have to look at some larger issues within. ;)",0
"if you use a rubber band on most cakes like you demonstrate, it will cut right through the frosting and into the cake. js That is not a good idea.",0
"I would like to preface this by saying... there's no ""wrong"" way to cut a cake, friend. If you have cake in front of you, you're already winning no matter how you cut it.

But furthermore, this method makes absolutely no sense. The first person to get a slice gets a giant piece and basically wins the lottery. And with each progressive slice, the recipient gets a shittier and tinier piece.",17
"Do they not put refrigerated partially-eaten cakes in airtight containers where you come from?

"Each slice has to be long and skinny which is too awkward to deal with. Putting a rubber band on the cake is gross and would certainly ruin the decorations on the cakes I make. He should have waited a day, or at least a few hours in between each cut to see if the rubber band really held it tight enough to keep the sponge moist. I'm guessing no. Also, you don't get uniform amounts of frosting on each slice. Conclusion: interesting thought, but by no means a brilliant idea. Most likely not even a good idea.",0
Heres another tip: Don't put your cake in the fucking fridge. That's unorthodox.,1

"This is clearly a way of cutting cake devised by someone who a) doesn't normally eat cake (or doesn't understand that ""cake"" isn't a uniform substance, and preserving the ratio of dough / filling / icing is relevant), b) doesn't attend social gatherings (people expect to get similar slices, and the slices should be compatible with normal-sized knives and plates) and c) doesn't have a humidity-controlled compartment in his refrigerator (or indeed even a box).

It's unsurprising that this didn't catch on with the actual cake-slicing community, and, if anything, it's an example of how the oversimplification (or complete misunderstanding) of a problem can lead to a useless ""solution"". Spherical cows in a vacuum and all that.",0
clingfilm...bitch!,0
Happy birthday Brady!,0
"Most useless thing I have seen in a while. Not only that majority of cakes don't have such ice frosting on top of them which would make using rubber bands just destroy your cake, but you are also getting smaller pieces every time plus you can't eat it the same way you can eat your triangular one because it has to lay down on its side.",4
"I'll never cut a cake the same way again. Thank you, Alex and Brady, for showing me the error of my ways.",0

"This would only work with a cake that has a hard fondant frosting. A soft, moist cake would be very difficult to push together, let alone be held together by a rubber band.",0
So you mean picking up a cake with your hand and cutting it with your teeth.... until it's finished ISN'T the correct way to do it lol,0
You can't do that with a fresh cream cake though,0
"This video was posted on my birthday. What a coincidence!
Fascinating video (as always)",0
"Interesting for those that like cakes covered in nasty fondant. If it's a nice¬†butter cream¬†finish then it would be much harder to push it all together like this without ruining the even frosting job.

As you're moving the two slices together, the bottom icing would make a mess; it would either detach from the main cake (happens sometimes when you leave the cake in the fridge) or leave a trail of icing on the tray. Speaking of the tray, if you were to refrigerate the cake, wouldn't it get cold enough to stick onto the tray, making it hard to combine the two separated cake slices?",1
Just eat all the cake at the start,0
Option 2: Cover it with plastic wrap,1
"Nope, this is still not the most optimal cutting method.¬† Cut horizontally (i'd suggest a cm thick depending on the size of the cake) across the bottom of the cake keeping the blade perfectly level. Then pick the top up, and remove it from your slice.

If you want a ""layered cake"" you could make a rectangular cake and then place it on its side before frosting it.

1) Every slice will be the same size.¬† Slices will not decrease over time.
2) The cake to frosting ratio will not change over time (Except for the very last piece).

An alternative solution would be to have spare frosting, and upon making each cut (wedge or otherwise), simply covering the newly exposed area with more frosting. The downsides of course being the need to have and store the extra frosting, and altering the ratio of cake to frosting, which some people wouldn't enjoy.

Reminds me of the episode of the cosby show where Bill steals slices of cake then smooshes it shut :D,0
This is the anti-frosting methodology since made pointless via the refrigerator..,0
I find the use of elastic bands disturbing but the cutting method actually does make sense.,0
I wold invent the myth that that is the reason why the cake knife is that width which would solidify it in the world of America.,0
It's filet of cake!!!,0
"There's a much simpler approach that doesn't require weird shapes and frosting overload on the final pieces. ¬†Cut your cake as normal (the ""wrong"" way). ¬†Then, with a fairly small piece of cellophane, attach the cellophane only to the parts where the cake is exposed - the frosting ""preserves"" the rest of the cake. ¬†It definitely beats weirdly scrunching the cake together (which won't work well at all if you're using good frosting instead of yucky fondant) with your hands.

This was one of those things I saw my girlfriend do, and it just made total sense despite being a complete paradigm shift from my normal approach.",0

This would probably work well for camembert as well.,0
I think we do the wedges because we want everyone to have the same voume of cake...,0
"It probably won't be useful; I eat my cakes in like, 2-3 days flat, and I really don't care about if they're ""dry"" or not, in fact I never really noticed them.",0

Disagree - the wedge slice is more attractive than the slab!,0
"In case it's not a layer cake, but maybe a regular chocolate cake which is the same throughout, use this method:
1 - Grab a ruler and hold it vertically to mark ""Layers"" on the cake.
2 - Find a nice long piece of steel wire, and use it to slice off the top of the cake completely to make a ""Lid"" which we'll use later.
3 - Repeat for as many layers as the cake will allow without falling apart.
4 - The ""Lid"" can be put back on the cake for storage, no rubber bands necessary.

An added bonus to this trick is that serving many people is easy with a tall enough cake, and everyone gets an equivalent sized piece. For double the amount of people/servings, cut each layer in half, or even quarters if you're feeling especially social. For the single eater of cake, this method also saves work, as only one cutting session is required.",0
That just made me really want some cake...,0

day 2?? day 3?? cake rubber band? what is this blasphemy!?!?!,0
Britz and cooking....,0
the sides of most cakes are wet with frosting so you can't just bunch up the cut cake the way this guy does with his hands. which makes this way of cutting cakes totally impractical.,1
From day 3 you have to cut out 4 pieces otherwise what's left is not symmetrical and doesn't close exactly.,6

I love applying science to my regular daily activities. It's just very satisfying. One tip though; I put a slice of bread in my cookie container so that the cookies won't go hard and dry. They absorb moisture from the bread.,0
Waste 5 minutes to show just this simple method is kind of an insult.,0
This can all be solved simply by buying rectangular cakes,0
This assumes you don't eat the entire cake day 1,0

"Put a slice of bread on the edges with toothpicks, it'll keep the cake's open sides moist.",0
You should have a theme song for Numberphile.,0
"Ok, this is brilliant if exactly one aspect of cake cutting is all that matters to you. This is clearly a method suited for lonely people who make an entire cake for themselves and have to save it for several days. When I cut a cake it¬¥s usually for distributing a cake efficiently over a number of people, taking into account that they might not want the same amount, and giving everyone a fair representation of every part of the cake. And this method is an absolute disaster for that.",6
"This is to preserve a cake for oneself. But each day's slice is smaller than previous (for the same width). If sharing a cake, then more precise mathematics of Game Theory are required, such as¬†Selfridge‚ÄìConway discrete procedure for 3 persons sharing. For 4 or more people use Brams‚ÄìTaylor theorem: cake cut into at least 2n-2 +1 pieces and then each player in turn then trims progressively fewer pieces.

oh my birthday was yesterday and already cut my cake wrong,0
"So, you're essentially exchanging dry cake for a rubber taste.",0
I thought it would be about how to cut it scientifically in 13 pieces or whatever...,0
"Ingenious as this method may be, for solving 1 problem, I spot 2 new problems it creates:
1. Icing Overload Near the end, when you've already gobbled up most of the cake, you'll be left with weird outside edgy bits, thick with icing but lacking sponge. The icing-sponge ratio of those last few pieces will be all wrong.

2. Tensile Stress Overload In order to not get a massively oversized 1st slice, you'd have to cut quite a narrow block from the centre of the cake. The sponge may lack the strength to hold itself together, being so thin. At least with a wedge you maximise structural integrity by essentially having a traingular piece of cake.

"Before the answer was given, I had a short think and came up with basically the same thing (except I cut the middle diameter slice out and then didn't turn it perpendicular, but rather continued cutting parallel to that). ¬†But to be honest, I would rather do it the regular way to save on rubber bands and also to not have a guy licking his fingers and then putting his fingers all over each slice of cake to continue pushing it in again. ¬†That's just sick. ¬†(There's always the magic of aluminum foil, after all.) ¬†And finally, I originally thought this was about hot to cut slices of the exact same size to be fair to everyone. ¬†In that case, you would probably have to go through the diameter all the way to the other side. ¬†This method of course makes it harder to tell how much each person is getting.",3
"This method is extremely, in that mathematician's own word, ""faulty"".

this method of slicing a cake has far more downsides than you benefit from it:
up: its doesnt get so dry (useless if you are one of the 80% of people that would just eat the cake)
down: its not easy & fair shareable
if you dont cut in a perfect 90¬∞ it will get much more dry
those rubberbands were a bad joke
if you cut the first slice its too much for a single person or if you make it very thin its impossible to get it out
the last 4 bits will dry out if not eaten at once
if you cut it down again you only get the corners that are ( in almost every cake exept for this one ) very dry

Wouldn't the mathematically perfect way be to invite over enough people to eat the whole thing and then you don't have to worry about it?,0
you have a prablom,0
"Day three is where it goes wrong, if you cut of a peace from one half of the cake, that means you are making that right or left side smaller. If it's smaler than the other side, the bigger one will get dry on the parts that are sticking out and you'll get a dry crust on the side of your slice, not so pleasant. If you find a simple solution for day three, I will share you mine. It has to be as logic as the rest of the cake!¬†
Those cakes look wonderfull by the way.",0
"Far too much frosting on the last slice if you cut it like that, worse even if you have a cake with a crust and filling, you'll have only crust left in the end.",0
Cute,0
why not just get a rectangular cake and do it way easier,0
Happy Birthday!,0
I'm so gonna do this!,0

"Is it really scientific to make a simple task more difficult and less accurate?

(And who would worry about a cake that has icing so crusty you can push the pieces together by hand, and so hard that an elastic band won't sink into it anyway?)",0
I want cake now.....,0
I just eat the whole cake at once. I don't have to worry about dried ends and I don't have to transgress my aversion to frosting imbalances due to asymmetric cake pieces. :),0
I can't comprehend why someone would say you need more friends if you can't finish a cake in a day. Granted it usually lasts two days... maybe 3 if there happens to be other desserts on holidays in the fridge. Didn't your mothers bake shit for you just for the fuck of it? Doesn't always have to be a party. I woke up to 2 dozen banana muffins 3 days ago. Made some coffee and it was great.,0
everyone knows that the cake won't go in the fridge anyway ;),0
I love it! Can't wait for my birthday :D!,0

"Just put plastic wrap on the sides of the damn cake, it won't dry out",1
"There is a better way of doing that, the cake may look funny at the end but you allways will have pieces that look like triangles.",0
Usually I eat the cake in less than a day,1
what kind of person has cake leftovers?,0
"Here, it is assumed there is cake left over on the third day. The sad thing is, knowing me it would be completely gone on the second day. üéÇüëç",0
that's why you bake square cakes,0
Now i really want to eat a cake! I think I am going to cut the next cake I get this way.,0
"The much better solution is to simply apply frosting to the edges of every piece you cut. ¬†Because, come on, who doesn't want more frosting?",5
Now I want cake.,2
First World Problems all the way. ¬†LOL,0
"Fun fact: you can't do this with cheese. Because the best part of the cheese is the middle, so when you eat cheese with people, everyone gets a wedge. And if you're alone, you don't want to eat all the best cheese in one sitting.",0

The best way is to eat it in one sitting.,0
"Aahh, I wanna eat that! It looks so delicious!",0
Why not just put the cake in a Tupperware !! Will stay fresh for a few days.,0
"I was hoping you'd made a video about cutting rectangular cakes into pieces of equal volume, and icing area. The explanation I read for that when I was a kid was, hilarious, but I don't remember the specifics.",1
huge waste of rubben bands and science cant be perfect mixed with cooking,0
"who eats a cake in 3 days. :D it will gone in a day, most likely",0
Wow... today's my birthday...,0
"There is a better way to cut cake, or anything for that matter. If you have 4 people, cut it into fifths. Then when you've all had a slice, what are you going to do with the last slice? Share it by cutting it into fifths, each have a slice of that, then keep going. This way you can all eat cat forever. (at least according to zeno)",0
So much cake,0
A lot of the time the drying actually does well with the cake.,4
I never had this problem because I eat cakes always in one day.,0
And now I'm hungry.,0
"How about a video on the ""I cut you choose"" method of sharing cake next? A fun problem for 2 or 3 people, especially with non-uniform cakes!",1
Umm... Cake doesn't last more than one day. You eat it all. That's how it is supposed to work.,35
