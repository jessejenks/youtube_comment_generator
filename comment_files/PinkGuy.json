This will help 360 million people who currently use close-captions to understand videos, and I feel anyone should enjoy your work. Thank you and keep up the good work!"

    "commentText": "1:20 I felt bad for the old lady to the left... I mean she's probably been around since the 1950s at least or possibly even 1940s, and now this is the world she finds herself in where crazy Japanese people go around in spandex suits acting insane. If I have to toil through another 50 years or so on this Earth, then when I'm approaching my last decade or two, I don't think Pink Guy is what I'm gonna want to see. Though the 2060s version of Pink Guy is probably gonna be... like... someone wearing a sort of electric suit that shows extremely bright colours in a stripe pattern going every which way, and they'll have like these sort of roller shoes but they can roll the person in ANY given direction, while on their hands are some sort of strange propulsion device not unlike Iron Man's, but not meant for flying in the air. \n\nSo the hands are directed around them to propel them causing a sort of anime effect where putting their hands behind them make them run REAL fast even though the illusion is that they're moving SO fast that their arms drag behind them from wind resistance. They'll move strangely, but while doing flips, and the roller shoes/propulsion hands assist in those movement, while the strange sounds they make like Pink Guy will be altered by a tiny device in their mouths or worn on their throats that alter their voice immensely. The kids born in the 2040s-50s will get it, understand it, and maybe even have some basic idea of how all this shit works... but me? I grew up in a time when roller skates/shoes only go ONE way, propulsion hands were a work of fiction, there were some clothes with basic LED lights but nothing of any real complication that was available at an affordable price to the average consumer that could create the type of lighting effects I imagine being available on clothing 50 years from now, not to mention we still use physical currency like coins and bills. At least I still do anyways. Many people probably switched to credit cards entirely, but I think one day we won't even need those.\n\nSmartphones will be so small that they can be worn as glasses and probably accessed by pointing at things in front of you that other people can't see. More complicated things like computers will be on wristwatches or, for those who require more than just a simple laptop-like device, something the size of a modern day smartphone would be able to do all the things a desktop computer could do and more. As for what desktop computers will be? Everything necessary will be in something the size of a modern flatscreen TV, and yes, it will have a screen on it, but you could of course purchase a larger one. Well, 'larger', the screen itself will be large, but it will be a sort of holographic screen. It won't really be there. Videogames will no longer need keyboards or controllers; a sort of hat or helmet will allow you to control the game with your thoughts. Voice command will be at such a level of efficiency that no matter what accent you may have, or even if you're terribly drunk and so what you say is somewhat slurred, it will still understand you, so you can send messages, tell your TV to do things, or stuff like that just with your voice. Silent commands? Mouth reading technology so that people don't have to hear you talking to machines all the time, or speaking everything that you want written down in a 'text' or something like that.\n\nYeah, shit's gonna be crazy in 50 years, just look at how things have changed since 1966... I'm pretty sure that back then, a computer is something that needed an entire ROOM to fit in. Something that stored, say, 50mb of information probably weighed more than a child, or if I'm REALLY off, possibly more than a grown man. Cell phones were only around on Star Trek (if that show was around in 1966), and if car phones were around then I imagine they were expensive and possibly also low quality/connection. As for firearms, many nations still used single-stack pistols with a capacity of 7-8 rounds plus one in the chamber with the highest capacity pistol available, to my knowledge, with the magazine going into the grip of the frame, is the Hi Power with 13+1, or for Canada, 14+1 with our John Inglis mags. America had the M1911A1 (7+1 flush at the time), Germany the P1 (basically the P38 with a new name, later models getting an aluminium frame to make it lighter, 8+1), Russia the Makarov PM (8+1), and so on and so forth. \n\nAs for rifles, America just got their XM16 design working with the M16A1 I think, the XM16 was a jammy POS and lead to the poor reputation that likes to lurk nearby in the shadows even today. Most other NATO or future NATO nations would use the FN FAL or G3, both of which use full sized rifle rounds and 20 round mags, best kept in semi auto but sometimes have full auto available as well which in my opinion is kind of stupid. The Russians and many other Combloc nations are using AK variants by now. To my knowledge, India has only just started replacing their Mk.III* Lee Enfields, albeit they're new production or at least rechambered and fire the modern 7.62 Nato cartridge instead of .303. Still, they're going with something other than a bolt action now. I think the Indian Army was one of the last major nations on the world to replace their standard issue bolt actions; Lee Enfields are JUST that good.\n\nSexism and racist was still pretty prominent in American society though I think other developed nations would have been faring a LITTLE bit better than them in that respect. The whole 'equal pay among the genders' thing was probably still being worked on. I don't know for sure but it's POSSIBLE that rape was a more 'hush hush' thing that it was best to just not bring up and talk about. I think even the work of 'psychology' was in its infancy back then, or at least wasn't as well documented a field, if I'm not mistaken, but I very well might be considering I'm treading into unfamiliar territory that I'm not too well studied on. Quite sure that lobotomies were still a thing in the mid 1960s. Basically, anything that third wave feminists/femi-Nazis THINK is a big deal today, was probably something that was a big deal 50 years ago that the second wave feminists have already fixed. They're driving in a fully functioning and luxurious modern vehicle and complaining that it's too loud, it has too much exhaust, the engine isn't as powerful as they'd like, there's not enough options, and the safety features are lacking. ALL THESE THINGS HAVE IMPROVED IN THE LAST 50 YEARS! Vehicles are quieter, better on the environment, more powerful, has options galore, and they're more safe than they've probably EVER been, even though vehicular accidents are still a hugely major issue in loss of human life, FAR worse than firearms.\n\nWhy I'm typing this rant up for a Filthy Frank video? I have no fucking clue, nobody will probably ever read all this, but hey, it was fun to think about as I went about it... so cringey when someone says \"tl;dr\". It's like standing up on a little soap box with a megaphone and yelling \"THIS COMMENT IS TOO LONG FOR ME TO BOTHER READING! THE SIGHT OF AN OPEN BOOK SHOWING TWO FULL PAGES OF TEXT TERRIFIES ME! THIS IS SOMETHING I BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW, BECAUSE THIS PERSON TYPED A LOT OF WORDS, AND I THINK IT IS SILLY!\"\n\nI'm tired..."

We live in societies where its never really \"ok\" to do whatever you feel like doing, I think that's one of the main reasons this show is so popular, people look at this and immerse themselves into the act of mental freedom :) He has the Balls of an aussie and the intelligence of an asian. I think I can relate to the way he acts and speaks, I would probably behave similarly if I could just throw my mask off, but most people don't even realize the mask is there, thinking the way we behave in societies is natural to people, which is far from the truth. Even though he is exceptionally good at channeling his inner self without filters, I think there is still some work to be done in regard of the purity of his content, I mean I can sometimes see some hesitation, which I think prevents him from really getting fully immersed in oneself. Maybe someday Filthy Frank will go next level and really show us who he is, or how he feels."

Donkey then joined in and skull fucked me until I cried his cum. In the middle of the ogre orgy, a farquad as tall as the World Trade Center jumped into the battlefield. Shrek easily blasted the fuckwad farquad into orbit with his slimy, swampy, cock. Shrek then had an idea. He flew to New York and rammed his cock into the World Trade Center. \n\n\nAs I walked down the dark and quiet street, I saw a shadow of a man walk out of an alley. He put a gun to my head and demanded my wallet. I gave it to him and he saw a picture of Shrek. He looked at me and said \"Shrek is drek kid\" I replied. \"No u faggot\". He raised his gun and before he fired a faint smell of onions wafted into the air. Then Shrek walked towards him\" ogre my dead body!\" He fired an entire magazine into him. Shrek laughed, \"ogres have layers\". Shrek then impaled the farquadian cunt onto his throbbing swamp cock. Killing the robber in an instant. Shrek then penetrated me until he filled my bowels with his slimy jizz.😍"

Viktoria! \nDer Meister soll leben, \nDer wacker dem Sternlein den Rest hat gegeben! \nIhm gleichet kein Schütz von fern und von nah! \nViktoria! Viktoria! Viktoria!\n\nMax \nImmer frisch! Schreit! Schreit! \nWar ich denn blind? Sind denn die Sehnen dieser Faust erschlafft?\n\nKilian \nSchau der Herr mich an als König! \nDünkt Ihm meine Macht zu wenig? \nGleich zieh Er den Hut, Mosje! \nWird Er, frag ich, he, he, he?\n\nVolk \nWird Er - frag ich? Wird Er - frag ich? \nGleich zieh Er den Hut, Mosje!\n\nKilian \nStern und Strauß trag ich vorm Leibe! \nKantors Sepherl trägt die Scheibe! \nHat Er Augen nun, Mosje? \nWas traf Er denn, he, he, he?\n\nKilian \nDarf ich etwa Eure Gnaden \n's nächste Mal zum Schießen laden? \nEr gönnt andern was, Mosje! \nNun, Er kommt doch, he, he, he?\n\nMax \nLaßt mich zufrieden oder. . .! \n\nSzene II\n\nKuno \nWas gibt's hier? Wer untersteht sich, meinen Burschen anzutasten?\n\nKilian \nAlles in Güte und Liebe, werter Herr Erbförster, gar nicht böse gemeint! Es ist Herkommen bei uns, daß, wer stets gefehlt hat, vom Königsschuß ausgeschlossen und dann ein wenig gehänselt wird - alles in Güte und Liebe.\n\nKuno \nStets gefehlt? Max! Max! Ist's möglich? Du, sonst der beste Schütze weit und breit! Seit vier Wochen hast du keine Feder nach Hause gebracht, und auch jetzt. . .?\n\nKaspar \nGlaube mir, Kamerad: es hat dir jemand einen Weidmann gesetzt, und den mußt du lösen, oder du triffst keine Klaue.\n\nKuno \nPossen!\n\nKaspar \nLaß dir raten, Kamerad! Geh nächsten Freitag auf einen Kreuzweg, zieh mit dem Ladestock oder einem blutigen Degen einen Kreis um dich und rufe dreimal den großen Jäger...\n\nKuno \nSchweig, vorlauter Bube! Du bist ein Tagedieb, ein Schlemmer, ein falscher Würfler... hüte dich, daß ich nicht noch Ärgeres von dir denke. Max, sieh dich vor! Ich bin dir wie ein Vater gewogen; es freut mich, daß der Herr Fürst Sohnesrecht auf den Eidam übertragen will, aber, wenn du morgen beim Probeschuß fehltest, müßt' ich dir doch das Mädchen versagen.\n\nMax \nMorgen! Morgen schon!\n\nEinige Jägern \nWas ist das eigentlich mit dem Probeschusse? Schon oft haben wir davon gehört.\n\nKuno \nMein Urältervater, der noch im Forsthause abgebildet steht, hieß Kuno, wie ich, und war fürstlicher Leibschütz. Einst trieben die Hunde einen Hirschen heran, auf dem ein Mensch angeschmiedet war - so bestrafte man in alten Zeiten die Waldfrevler. Dieser Anblick erregte das Mitleid des damaligen Fürsten. Er versprach demjenigen, welcher den Hirsch erlege, ohne den Missetäter zu verwunden, eine Erbförsterei und zur Wohnung das nah gelegene Waldschlößchen. Der wackere Leibschütz besann sich nicht lange. Er legte an und der Hirsch stürzte, und der Wilddieb war, obwohl im Gesicht vom Dorngebüsch zerkratzt, doch im übrigen unversehrt.\n\nVolk \nDas war ein Meisterschuß!\n\nKuno \nAuch mein Urvater freute sich sehr, und der Fürst erfüllte in allem seine Zusage.\n\nKilian \nAlso davon schreibt sich der Probeschuß her, Nachbarn und Freunde. Nun weiß man's doch auch!\n\nKuno \nHört noch das Ende! Es ging damals wie jetzt, daß der böse Feind immer Unkraut unter den Weizen sät. Kunos Neider wußten es an den Fürsten zu bringen, der Schuß sei mit Zauberei geschehen, Kuno habe nicht gezielt, sondern eine Freikugel geladen.\n\nKaspar \nDacht' ich's doch! Hilf zu, Samiel!\n\nKilian \nEine Freikugel? Das sind Schlingen des bösen Feindes; meine Großmutter hat mir's einmal erklärt. Sechse treffen, die siebente gehört dem Bösen; der kann hinführen, wohin's ihm beliebt.\n\nKaspar \nAlfanzerei! Nichts als Naturkräfte!\n\nKuno \nAus diesem Grunde machte der Fürst bei der Stiftung den Zusatz: \"Daß jeder von Kunos Nachfolgern zuvor einen Probeschuß ablege, schwer oder leicht, wie es der regierende Fürst anzubefehlen geruhe\". Doch genug nun! Wir wollen uns auf den Weg machen! Du aber, Max, magst noch einmal zu Hause nachsehen, ob sämtliche Treibleute angelangt sind. Nimm dich zusammen! Der Weidmann, der dir gesetzt ist, mag die Liebe sein. Noch vor Sonnenaufgang erwarte ich dich beim Hoflager.\n\n(Terzett und Chor)\n\nMax \nOh, diese Sonne, \nFurchtbar steigt sie mir empor!\n\nKuno \nLeid oder Wonne, \nBeides ruht in deinem Rohr!\n\nMax \nAch, ich muß verzagen, \nDaß der Schuß gelingt!\n\nKuno \nDann mußt du entsagen!\n\nKaspar \nNur ein keckes Wagen \nIst's, was Glück erringt!\n\nMax \nAgathen entsagen, \nWie könnt' ich's ertragen? \nDoch mich verfolget Mißgeschick!\n\nChor \nSeht, wie düster ist sein Blick! \nAhnung scheint ihn zu durchbeben!\n\nJägern \nO laß Hoffnung dich beleben, \nUnd vertraue dem Geschick!\n\nMax \nWeh mir! Mich verließ das Glück! \nUnsichtbare Mächte grollen, \nBange Ahnung füllt die Brust! \nNimmer trug' ich den Verlust!\n\nKuno \nSo's des Himmels Mächte wollen, \nDann trag männlich den Verlust!\n\nKaspar \nMag Fortunas Kugel rollen; \nWer sich höhrer Kraft bewußt, \nTrotzt dem Wechsel und Verlust!\n\nChor \nNein, nein, nimmer trüg' er den Verlust! \nNein!\n\nKuno \nMein Sohn, nur Mut! \nWer Gott vertraut, baut gut! \nJetzt auf! In Bergen und Klüften \nTobt morgen der freudige Krieg!\n\nJägern \nDas Wild in Fluren und Triften, \nDer Aar in \nKuno \nPossen!"

Pink guy rips out his massive horse sized cock. I am ready for this. He takes off my pants and enters without warning. My muscles try to tense up, but I'm so dehydrated that I can't do a thing. Pink guy thrusts me ruthlessly for two hours. I have lost a gallon of blood. But as pink guy finishes, and unleashes his chromosomes in me, I start to feel rejuvinated, and alive again.

Then a voice was heard from behind him \"Ey b0ss you found another goofball?\", \"Yeah Pink guy, this one looks like a complete dick head, his girlfriend is pretty banging though, I'd fuck her asshole\", \"Oh yeah b0ss, maybe we should fill his girlfriend ass with goofballs so she'd know how much of a goofball he is\". Right at that moment Frank jumped on my girlfriend and pulled her pants down, I tried to stop him but pink guy jumped on me and held me down he started whispering in my ear \"She's going to get the goofballs and you aint going to do nothing about it b0ss!\", I watched on in horror as my girlfriend stared at me in the eyes as Frank undressed her and rammed his fingers up her ass, she was trying to scream but Frank just kept pushing her head down. Frank looked at me and mouthed the word \"Goofball\", It was like a silent movie, I watched as Frank then proceeded to pull out his testicles and forcibly push them into her anus with his hands. Pink guy who was still holding me down started to squeal into my ear \"She's getting the goofballs b0ss\", he started to twist my nipple as far as it could go, and I could feel blood trickling from it onto my shirt, I felt what I can assume was Pink guy's boner pushing into my back...
