Without a solution to their extinction; the companies are scrambling to figure out how to slow their descent.

Two, if you're actually trying to show how ridiculous it is.\n\nIf you think it's cool: If you hadn't noticed, you were coughing almost immediately, and coughing tends to be a bad sign. I mean, you could go ahead and kill yourself with it, wouldn't be very productive in my opinion, but hey, your life. At least you wouldn't be around to convince others to smoke.\n\nIf you're actually criticizing it: ...well, just make sure people know you're doing so, because (I assume) we're all confused here. I still don't think it's worth it, though. Then again, worth is a matter of personal opinion, so I'll leave that for you to judge. But again, do try not to die from lung(/other) cancer. I hope we at least agree that dying early from cancer doesn't sound very appealing."

Now I havent smoked in a year and a half and recent did a 10K. I personally just hate that people are afraid or ashamed to do something that will help them quit an addiction and live a healthier longer life. That said, yes there are some dumb vape dbags out there. The ones making dumb videos doing stupid trick shit. And Ethan...this was funny as hell."

No one who you've never even met before wants to smell a big cloud of your filthy, stale exhalation on public transport, on the footpath, in the mall, or for that matter any place else whatsoever- it's only a fraction better than straight up farting directly on someone's face and then asking them how it smells, oblivious to the fact that what you just did is horrible, rude and totally disgusting!"

Meme addiction is nothing to joke about; I've had a friend die of a Rain Florence overdose. Ever since I joined the Naysh, though, I've gone green and replaced my chronic meme use with vaping. Now, instead of being addicted to memes, I'm an insufferable, vegan douchebag environmental activist. I have also become a flaming homosexual who fucks more men than Neil Patrick Harris.

Vaping is a really great thing for people who are looking for something less harmful than cigarettes.  Or to help them quit all together.  People that act like this though, make the community look horrid.  Which leads to vape bans.  Which leads to us as people not able to get the products we want to be a little healthier."

    "commentText": "A travelling salesman is driving along a dusty backroad to his next sale, when his car starts belching smoke. He sees storm clouds coming his way and night is falling soon. Getting out of the car he looks around for shelter and sees an antiquated old monastery on a hill not 5 minutes walk away. He heads over and knocks on the door just as the rain starts falling and a kindly monk answers. \"Hi, my car is broken down on the road\" says the salesman, \"and I see a storm coming in. Can I stay the night and call a tow truck in the morning? I won't be any trouble...\" \"not at all my good man\" the kindly monk replied, \"Come in! Come in! Lets get you a hot meal and some dry clothes!\" So the salesman is ushered into the church and given a wonderful bowl of hearty stew and bread to eat. Not realizing his hunger before the salesman devours the food in between words of thanks. \"I don't know how I can repay you people...\" \"well actually\" said the kindly monk who answered the door, \"our abbot bores so easily in the realitive solitude of our church, and he loves to talk with travelers\" \"of course!\" replied the salesman, \"in return for this hospitality its the least i could do\" So the kindly monk leads the salesman deeper into the monastery and as he does he hears the faintest sound... thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... But the salesman thinks its just the storm outside making noise and pays it no mind. He reaches the abbots quarters and meets a man seeminglyas ancient as the building he runs who greets him with a smile and firm handshake. The two speak to each other at length with hours seeming like minutes as the storm pounds the outside, and all the while the man hears that same noise... thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... Eventually the conversation draws to a natural end and the abbot looks over the salesman's shoulder. \"good heavens, look at the time. we both should get some rest\" the abbot commented, \"the brother you met before will take you to your chambers for the night\" And so the salesman is taken to his spartan looking accommodations, and just as the kindly monk is leaving the room the salesman asks, \"by the way, i keep hearing this strange thumping sound all the time. Its that normal? What is that?\" The monk looks down at his feet, and for the first time since the salesman came into the monastery the smile falls from his face. He quickly stares at the floor and stammers, \"I-I-I don't know what you're talking about. Sleep well.\" Slamming the door behind him. The salesmans sleep is restless as now the same sound as before stays next to him, breathing on his neck.... thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... When dawn breaks the salesman calls a tow truck, and while waiting says his goodbyes and thank yous. Finally when the tow truck arrives he turns to the abbot and says, \"thank you so much for everything again, but I must ask; what is that strange thudding noise I hear? The storm is over yet I heard it clearly all night?\" The monk gains a sudden steel in his eyes and locks them dead onto the salesman. \"I can't tell you, you're not a monk.\" And with that, bids him farewell. The salesman finishes his route without incident, and heads home to his wife and child. But incessantly, as if by hearing it he could no longer un-hear it, at the quietest moments in his life, the salesman hears a soft thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... The seasons pass into years and the years pass into decades. The mans son grows and leaves to be his own man, and after decades of bliss the mans wife passes away peacefully in his arms one morning. As the life leaves his loves eyes the only sound heard is a simple thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... With a life now emptier the thudding becomes constant, unceasing, droning. When he sleeps, eats, shits thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... Finally, standing it no longer the man drives all day and night to the same dirt road he so happened to break down upon and every mile, every town he passes as constant as the odometer thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... Finally he reaches the monastery and knocks on the door and just as before a fresh faced kinly monk answers. \"I WISH TO JOIN YOUR ORDER\" the man blurts before the monk can say anything. The monk gains a knowing smile and says no more, beckoning the man to follow him. He leads the man on the same path he took those years and years before and directs him into the abbots room. Inside is the same man as the night he stayed before, looking not a day older. \"Please abbot.\" The man begged, \"I can't stop hearing that thudding noise, night and day I can't escape it. Can't you let me know what it is?\" The abbot replies with the same steely matter-of-fact tone as he did all those years before, \"I can't tell you, you're not a monk.\" \"Thats what I feared your answer would be. Please then, let me become a monk so I can learn and get this sound from my head.\" The abbot takes a long look, dripping with both hunger and pity and after a handful of breathes agrees.\" The training is arduous and lengthy. The salesman is not a young man anymore and the demands, moth mental and physical task him to the core of his very being. He sleeps on stone, reads nothing but the texts of the obscure religious sect he wishes to join and eats nothing but gruel and through every minute, every blister, every headache, every pang of hunger the sound is there. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... Finally after several years worth of trails the man finally is ready to be inducted. The moment after the ceremony inducting him is complete he bolts to the chambers of the abbot. \"There, I did it. I'm a member of the order. NOW TELL ME WHAT THAT NOISE IS.\" \"Are you sure you wish to know?\" the abbot grimaces, \"It will change the way you think of not just the order, or me, but everything.\" \"Yes!\" the man cries \"I've never been more sure of anything in my life!\" \"Very well\" replied the abbot. And with that the sound in the mans head lessened, as if the promise curiosity being fed was able to sate the beast, even if for a moment. But still, even though quieter it was still present. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... The abbot pulls a seemingly random book off the shelf behind him, and opens it. He reveals it to be hollow and pulls a monstrous set of keysfrom it and tucks them into his sleeve. He then pulls another book from the shelf and the shelf splits in half and opens like the doors in a supermarket with the sound of the grinding of ancient stone. Where the shelves used to be there is a door made of iron. The abbot pulls theset of keys out with an iron key extended, opens the door and swings it aside. As the man follows the abbot into the path behind the door he notices the sound getting louder. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... They walk along a dark and musty path, the air like a forgotten wine cellar or crypt with the abbot wordlessly staring forward with grim purpose. He reaches the next door, a door made of polished bronze, reflecting as perfectly as a mirror. He pulls out a bronze key from the keyring in his sleeve and opens the door. Sure enough as the man passes though, a little louder this time thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... After the bronze door came a staircase, down and down and down it went, until it seemed that they were descending into hell itself. Windingstairs, spiral stairs, branching stairs leading to nowhere and yet the two marched on, reaching a silver door. The abbot pulled out a silver key and as before set the door aside, making the sound ever louder. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... And then, it was time to climb. Yet the abbot, a man of innumerable years climbed as surefooted as a goat while the salesman followed behind, exhausted but determined not to give up now. At the apex of the climb, a door of gold was before them. The abbot then pulled a gold key, andin the grim routine as before, the door fell aside and the sound became ever louder. It seemed to be right next to them, a tangible force. Athird person on this bizarre trek. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... After the golden door came a maze. Dizzying and seemingly endless, the abbot had no hesitation in his step and never second guessed himself.Hours passed in the maze as hours had passed in all the paths before and yet without ever turning around the abbot and the salesman reached a platinum door. As you can guess, platinum key, door, noise. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... As the man walked into the next door he hesitated for the first time on his trip. The walls themselves seemed to be alive, screaming things inalien tongues as if the brick and mortar where being tortured. Grotesque faces in the masonry screamed as if every injustice upon earth was being visited upon them and yet somehow they could not drown out that sound, pounding louder than it ever had. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... After the hours that seemed of days in the pathway that screamed ceaselessly they reached a door, red and pulsing, as if made of some sort of flesh. The abbot pulled out a bony, fleshy....something from his keyring and inserted it into the door. All at once the walls stopped screaming, the flesh melted into nothing on the floor and the sound grew terrible and great. Louder and unchanged. thump thump...thump thump...thump thump... Behind the former wall of flesh was not another passage but a box. Wooden small and humble. The abbot pulled out one final key of wood and unlocked and opened the box. As he pulled the box open the sound became deafeningly loud and the man finally looked inside and gave a horrified scream. He saw his son getting buttraped by midget demon clowns."

I never knew the name of the channel until a month or two ago when I stumbled across it in reccomended videos. since then I have seen every Ethan and Hila and every H3H3 video, and I watch new content as soon as it is released.

Lately he's been acting as if he's the fucking God of YouTube, telling others what they should do and how they should do it. He used to just post funny fucking videos man, now he's just a pretentious drama shitstorming \"le anti cyber bullying\" faggot and a lot of his titles are just as clickbait as anyone else's. His fans need to stop overusing the word \"cancer\" for anything they dislike and stop praising him as if hes some sort of a fucking comedic genius. Hes a backstabbing Jew."

That would have been a better mark for a sketch in my opinion, but I guess jumping on dumbass bandwagons and making fun of people that have an addiction and are trying to find a healthier alternative or a way out of it is easier.\n\nJust the opinion of someone that's tired of seeing something that has bettered my life attacked by misinformed people that without their own knowledge are helping out Philip Morris ;-)"

Now we have to find the equation \noof+lauh. Because there are no equal letters on earthier side we have to divide oof in too lauh.\noof/lauh= oof-oo/lauh= f/lauh-oo\nSO this means we have to get rid of 2 letters in the equation besides o and o so lets get rid of lu and use those later.\nso ah is your answer after subtracting. But if ah it is flipped to HA this means x(unknown) +HA=FAG\nThis means lu cubed equals Laugh because it has tripled the letters from f. \nLaugh is equal to Pi meaning its infinite. \nLAUGH+HA=FAG is my final answer WAIT I almost forgot FAG= Leafy+12 year-old fanbase \nCAN YOU SOLVE IT?"

Then when Drama alert makes a video, that will only scoop in more views on H3H3 and Leafys channel, causing them to gain more money. While Pyrocinical is also in the deal trying to explain why people shouldn't harass others. By doing so, Pyro creates a neutrality amongst the viewers causing people to neither side with H3H3 or Leafy, but to stay neutral as well. And the more people who stay nuetral, the more views Pyro has, the less Disslikes and more likes H3H3 Will obtain and the less harassment from viewers will the ones being roasted will receive. causing a globally nuetral community which again, feeds Pyro money."

I do feel that it's a good (and fair) thing that everyone gets to know Ethan's \"crooked\" personality, and especially so they stop unjustly condemning Leafy.\nHowever, I think that should be it. No fucking YouTube war, no dislike spam, no unsubscribing etc. I think we should be able to separate someone's personality (as good or bad as it may be) from their content, especially if it's good content, which is the case with h3h3."

Leafy was able to make 4 videos while on adderall wich can tell us how much effort it takes to create those(none). pyro and leafy are litterally cancer \nthey just grow tumors of 12 year old kids to spread around comment sections. literally 95% of the leafy fans who commented on this video are probably 12 or really immature."

Keep up the epic work guys, so proud of you! (PS: Absolutely love the little pause in the music video and then the 'proud of you' quote brings it back in.

Was it ya boi SamPepper or SoFlo that made those comments on Pyro? I'm sure this is a subject that a few h3h3/Pyrocynical fans would like to see elaborated on.

    "commentText": "Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace is a 1999 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It is the first installment in the Star Wars prequel trilogy and stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Pernilla August and Frank Oz.\n\nThe film is set thirty-two years before the original film, and follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they protect Queen Amidala, in hopes of securing a peaceful end to a large-scale interplanetary trade dispute. Joined by Anakin Skywalker‚Äîa young slave with unusually inherent powers of the Force‚Äîthey simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the Sith.\n\nLucas began production of this film after he concluded that film special effects had advanced to the level he wanted for the fourth film in the saga. Filming started on June 26, 1997, at locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert. Its visual effects included extensive use of computer-generated imagery (CGI); some of its characters and settings were completely computerized and did not exist in the real world. The film was Lucas' first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following Star Wars in 1977.\n\nThe Phantom Menace was released to theaters on May 19, 1999, sixteen years after the premiere of the previous Star Wars film, Return of the Jedi. The film's premiere was extensively covered by media and was greatly anticipated because of the large cultural following the Star Wars saga had cultivated. Despite mixed reviews from critics, who tended to praise the visuals, action sequences, John Williams' musical score, and the performances of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Pernilla August, and Ian McDiarmid, but criticize the writing, characterization and acting, it grossed more than US$924.3 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, making it the second-highest-grossing film worldwide at the time‚Äîbehind Titanic. It became the highest-grossing film of 1999, the highest-grossing Star Wars film (until the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in 2015), and is currently the seventeenth-highest-grossing film in North America unadjusted for inflation. A 3D reissue, which has earned an additional US$102.7 million at the box office and brought the film's overall worldwide takings to over US$1 billion, was released in February 2012. The film was followed by two sequels, Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones in 2002 and Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith in 2005."

About 86% of leafy's fangirl's father's left them at a very young age so they are very sensitive to talking about parents.\n5. Last but not least there YouTube photo is most likely either Minecraft, Roblox, or anime.\n\nThis guide will help you into finding any leafy fangirl, once you find one please kill them to save your brain cells."

Seeing someone with a E-cig should make you say \"good for them\" not \"what a faggot\"\n\nDon't be put off of vaping if you are looking for a way to quit smoking. it is the most effective way to give up. Do it properly and start with high nicotine then work your way down. That's how they take people off harder drugs. Any relapse after this method is based purely on choice because your body doesn't need the substance anymore. So the rest is a psychological battle.   \n\nBtw the video is too funny, i love it when h3h3 makes videos in public"

I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo."

I know Ethan wasn't trying to say everyone who vapes is some sort of edgelord douche, but I feel like a lot of people might get that impression from the video. I just wonder if Ethan actually ended up getting the setup he was using in the video or borrowing it from a friend or something, because it was actually decent setup lol. And as someone who actually uses e-cigs or \"vapes\" for legitimate reasons, I can say I probably hate the people who use them to be \"cool\" a lot more than people who are out of the vaping community.\nEither way, awesome video, guys!

However, in the video he claims that you sent him very aggressive messages calling him cancer as well as messaging other youtubers asking them to make negative videos about Pyrocynical. I am a longtime fan of your channel and this really didn't sound like something you guys would do but I am also a fan of Pyrocynical and I don't understand why he would completely make up so serious a allegation.  Could you address this in a ethan and hila video or at least talk about it soon? This seems like something that could possible escalate to something more serious if not addressed quickly! Papa Bless"

Just keep going crazy and take your time, that was some Filthy Frank lvl cringy shit.\nThis and the modern art were your best videos by far, in my opinion. I don't know, they make such a ripple in the real world (the Ebay hat listing, and the news reporter tweet along with the shop vists and police/people interactions...), i'm loving it!!"

GRIND MY HOLE OPEN WITH THAT POLE!!!!\n n\n  ||\n  ||\n  ||\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ethan is our justice hero. he is here to save our souls! you know what, i forget why i was writing this. I think i put to much bleach in my drink, take what I wrote with a grain of whole wheat, and lets see what goes on from here, WHOOOIEEEE 2016 THE DAY WE ALL DEVOLOPED ONSET DIABETES! well actually that was a different story, i think that was 1971 when monsanto come out and fucked vietnam with agent orange, thats when we all got diabetes. notice thats also when Mcdonalds started getting real popular, The only thing that makes sense now is youtubers fighting eachother. If we get more of these, I think our younger generations might learn a thing or two. we dont need to teach our children litterature, english, or even grammar. those things are useless! what we need is some good writing classes, like amaerican novels where we learn the lore behind our finding fathers! that is when we delve deep into our synopsis of where we are relative to the universe. if you think about, we are traveling a means of 800Klm a seconds, just by sitting. not because you ran to the store in back. but because our universe is expanding outwards into the abyss, and you know what, the closer we go out into the abyss, the more everything makes less and less sense, if we see the world for what it really is. we would be grinding quartz crustles under ground in the deepest dungeons. to find the higher beings within the crystals. If we look deep into what we are made out of, we are 100% of the time, a carbon based life form, well you know what, god dam carbon came from god dam suns! so we are god dam suns! they exploded and we fucking came out of theme, and we landed on this dam earth. or were we aall a big group of people floating in space, with no planet, and then all of a suddon, earth floated over to us. and landed on us! what if we werent fucking fish or monkeys, but we were atoms in the sun that just got fucked and one idiot had the nerve to shout the words \"god\" out, and all the other humans were like! WHOA THAT WORD IS THE THING THAT IS I THINK SOMETHING THAT MADE US! BECAUSE A SUN COULD NOT MAKE US THAT WOULD BE STUPID!\" so everyone agreed and started fallowing that one idiot. and the thing is, there is proof of a sun everyday, hense why they call it DAY, but theres no proof of a god! god doesnt float around the dam earth and bless us with light everyday! NO! THE FUCKING SUN DOES! and we dont even praise that shit!! the egyptians had it right! they prasied that mother fucking sun! they said hey! lets call that floating giant ball of bright juices \"RA\" and all the egyptians were like \"YA\" so everyone got along and fucking praised the sun, grew there dam crops, built fucking pyramids and met aliens before they got corrupted by AYY LMAO, back when aliens had class! back when they built dam pyraminds! LIKE FUCK! when do we have to be lobotomised to see, that we are fucked as a civilization, and we have no point of existing, other than to get on 2 knees, praise to that bitch named god, and to pay bills, so rich white rice fuckers get a lot of dam money, so they dont have to do sheit! And that is why I think Vape Nation Will over come in the next prophecy, and we will triumph in the night! GOOD NIGHT FELLOW VAPE NATORS!!! STAY REPPIN!"

But, I also hate getting stared at every time in public because I'm using a vaporizer and everybody assumes I'm the exact same way... Which is probably why I dislike the douchebags I just mentioned so much. I wish people wouldn't assume I'm just as douchey, but I don't know whether to get mad at the people staring at me or the people blowing opaque clouds of steam in people's faces because of it. So I just stay mad at myself for ever smoking cigarettes in the first place. I'll kill myself soon enough guys, don't worry. Probably not until Ethan and Hila quit making videos though, it keeps me wanting to live for at least one more video. Papa bless."

I don't go out and buy these fancy monstrosities and try to blow the biggest clouds possible and neither does anyone I know. Most of us are just trying to kick a deadly habit. I've been smoke free for almost a year and a half. What gets me is people who don't know any better see this stuff, and yes also the idiot vapers out there, and it turns them away from a great product. Also, this video wasn't even up to h3 standards.

As someone who absolutely hate's all the tobacco vaping and the myth that it stops people from smoking or it's better for them. An it's annoying how they try to bring their nasty lung filled moisture to places you can't even normally smoke. Then again that's their business and people can do what they want. \n\nThen again as someone who smokes pot medicinally i dont get why they are lumping the two together? I mean what cures cancer, that he was talking about? Because he's sending mixed messages here. So is he talking about pot curing cancer to that cop or is he talking about vaping? You can read countless testimony of people who were nearly at the point of killing themselves from how severe their cancer treatment was going and then instead of going back to synthetic heroin(pills) tried pot and they felt themselves coming back to life. Vaping doesn't do that so....what exactly is he talking about? \n\nI'm also not a fan of \"weed\" culture. I think you can get lost in pot if you decided to put all your energy into it and let it consume you like any other addiction. This video just confused me because it's putting apples and oranges together and hating on appange's."

I want to stuff you up my kawaii ass!\" Woody grabbed a bunch of flavored live and rubbed it all over is head Woody: \"Oh my! It's cherry flavored lube! Cherry is my favorite! Woody then stuffed his head up into Andy's tight ass! The other toys around the room watched intently as Woody shoved his head back and forth into Andy's nice ass, continuously making a squishy wet noise. The other toys also became aroused and they all gathered around Woody and Andy and started to urinate all over them, and then they started to masturbate. Andy: \"Oh my goodness, Woody Chan! You are churning my insides up so well! Your nose is stimulating my prostate! OH YES! All the other toys became so aroused by this, that they could not help themselves anymore! They pushed Woody completely inside, and they all went inside. All of them wanted to be inside Andy's nice round ass. Andy: \"No wait guys! My ass cannot hold this much! I'm getting so full! All the toys went inside of poor squirming Andy and pretty much, he was beyond full, and died from having his insides completely damaged.
