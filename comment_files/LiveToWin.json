Paul and Nyro are both of Jewish heritage and both attended the Manhattan High School of Music and Art: both were accepted for their art prowess, but ended up recording stars. Paul graduated in 1970, the same year Nyro was given special recognition by the High School for her success as a recording artist. Also, Paul co-wrote this song with Desmond Child, who is also a huge Laura Nyro fan. See Nyro's induction into the Rock Hall of Fame in 2012 by Bette Midler (wonderful). Paul thinks its more appropriate that Nyro¬†be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame since her music isn't strictly rock. Nyro is actually unique, and is one of the most¬†revered artists by other artists in the music industry. She is legendary. A phenomenal talent."
