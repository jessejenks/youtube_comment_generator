"I think the video itself was filmed nicely. It all seemed to go smooth for a rap video. The moral of the song is not in good taste for what could viewed by unattended children who's parents may even listen to crap like this in their company. this is only a small fragment of what's wrong within our country. it's no wonder our sweethearts get raped and more kids dont graduate but instead become knocked up baby mommas, young moms & dads strapped w sentences and probations for BS thinking they're HARD. Wasting your own precious time young men. Enjoy it anyhow. Fortune and fame for as long as you ""work"" for it.",0

But its ok....do your thing Young Trash... because Hip-Hop world won´t miss you at the end of the day anyway.",33
"Who gives credit to this fake ass rapper? No skill , no knowledge , no content, no flow, just a pure crack head living high with the money you guys are given by supporting him. 
Ask Tupac if he would listen to this shit...lmao you got your answer right.",10
moral of the story make sure you get paid!!! cover your p's and q's!! how fuckn selfish of an artist. hell i cant understand his mouth anyways. I'll stick to real mc's. I started with hip hop back in 92 the Chronic Album. I know that most of his shit is garbage but good that u didn't lose out on makn ur cash back.,0

Was the music videos purpose to act like Young thug never showed up and is actually fucking with us🤔🤔,0

Any haitian here,46
Wyclef da fuck you doing on this shitty track....dissappointed asf,0
is this some sort of research video to see if people actually understand what this music's message is ??,0
"Genius - pure Genius. Young Thug put this on his official channel so he clearly co signs. I feel like he's this generations Bowie in attitude ie voluntarily pushing archetypes to the extremme simultaneously paying homage AND mocking them (down to his name!) , changing characters and names at will while putting out amazing music. Genius -Pure Genius!",0
So. fresh,0
"Dope video, funny way it came into existence :). I wonder what Young Thug thought through the process and now when its done.",0
he wanna be in one of the cars? Or in one of the bitches?,0
Creative video. Like how they did this,0
So what's the song about again...?,0
"2:53 yoooo had them same artifacts about a week ago, thought my graphics card was fucked up... not cool",0
The point of the video is that he plays with his money and don't care he knew what he doing by not showing up that's what he wanted the original Idea was to set the entire budget on fire and in a way that's what he did,0
Young Thug = Deuses da música,0

No director - if you'd promised a naked man crapping in a bucket there'd be plenty still watching.  It's the expectation that something unusual might happen. Most shocking thing about this is how Thug in the 21st century hasn't evolved..........'bitches' and 'hoes'? Drag the the man out of his cave.,0

This is the smartest music video I have seen that represents a mindless douche with a shitty music. I enjoyed even more muting the whole thing and reading the commentary. Kudos to the director and producers!,13
2:57 - 3:09 best part out of the whole video,0

I was to busy looking at the video to make sense out of the mumbling retard,0
The point of the video is Thugger gave $100K for a crew to shoot him a video he was never apart of. Can't ever say he ain't give nobody nothing. Kinda like Wyclef does for Haiti 😏😏😏,0
the song has a chill vibe and the video is so 🆒⚡ I even think Young thug is trash tho,0

Because their countries will be so unGreat, they will be jealous and desperate to discover the secret of greatness.  
And this will make me the COOLEST american president EVER!!!",0
it's a genius marketing tactic. Obviously the video was meant to be like this. Makes it creative and gets ppl talking.,0
"this is mean to trick you.,its hilarous!",0
"This is actually the most original and so unprofessional it's hilarious music video that actually works! I'm just wondering how did Young Thug's team approve of this? Or maybe he didn't because ""none of this matters""!",0

this was genius.,0
😍😍,0
"This video is just like my personal feelings about Young Thug himself: Random as fuck, no clue what was going on and don't care at all. 

Oddly enough, this might be the only (Keyword: ONLY) standalone Young Thug song (minus guest appearances on ""If It Ain't About the Money"" with T.I., the remix with Young Jeezy, ""No Limit"" with Usher and ""Low"" with Juicy J & Nicki Minaj) I can tolerate. He still sucks though. But, this song? It's alright with me. Still don't like him.",0

"Wtf how is this trending, shit beat, shit lyrics, same video with girls, a guy whose voice cracks everyone 5 seconds and then mumbles the rest how just how",0
Young thug is the most generic rap name I have heard,0
That was smart.,0
THIS IS DOPE NO MATTER WHAT PEOPLE SAY LOL,0
This one of the most clever music videos ever and I hope more artists can take influence from this.,0
G E N I U S,1
am i the only one who thinks that this was all planned this way so it would get more views like why would he post this to his yt if it's a piece of trash he obviusly wanted the video to turn out like this and maybe this was hid idea all along he wanted to do something different to get some more attention,0
God I hate this generations music so much.,1

Love the song even though can't understand what language he's rapping in,1
"i swear if this had a real $100,000 generic rap video this would get way less views.",0
I feel like this was planned so that the music video would stand out from the crowd. And it definitely worked since I know I wouldn't be watching this otherwise.,0
Woah Thugger has the idgaf kinda attitude,0
he knew exactly what he was doing... this is a just a creative stunt and it has worked!!,0
PRICELESS!😄...😂,0

"This. Is. What I call. Rebellion. Thanks Pomp&Clout (I don't know how this ended up on his official channel?

LEGEND,0
I love this lmao,0
this S** had me dying😂,0
Went to a Young Thug concert and he showed up 2 and 1/2 hours late. His meet and greet was him standing 2 feet away from you in a selfie; no group pictures allowed. Shouts out to the director for his creativity. Young Thug is an asshole,0
amazing stuff...  it makes the song feel short..,0
I don't understand why people keep dissing Young Thug's vocals but somehow they keep on listening and coming for more. Lets face it though the guy knows how to make PROFIT.,0
"For real, this shows just how irrelevant Young Thug is. lol",0
This is actually genius because you wanted to know what else happened so you had to listen to the whole song and you gave them views and money!😱🤑,1
"I want to be YouTube rich.
Subscribe to me",1
"This video is actually pretty much perfect from a marketing point of view, it going viral is priceless so the $100,000 is actually nothing compared to what he would have had to pay to get this many views (and how much he's made back from YouTube ads)... actually things aligned so well I'd say this whole thing was planned.",0
"""He didn't show up.""  
Suuuuure. This might be just a variation of ""beef"". hihi. Cool music video though, regardless.",0
the most stupidest video ever,0
😂😂😂😂😂,0

music is trash.",0
Lmao what a scumbag thug,0
bruh music videos should be like this... This is like the only music video I watched fully,0
it's good he had a senior and didn't show up this is way better.,0
is the movie he wanted to reference 'Requiem for a Dream'?,0
Got free beats on my channel if any of you guys are rappers.,0
Young thug is a bitch,0
So we all kinda played ourselves or got played,0
maybe the whole video  was a lie and the thing was to make it like this,0
So thugger wants to nut on kids faces.... :/,0
Btw the movie they were trying to reference was Requiem for a Dream.,0

Best music video ever?,0
Its still a good video,0
Didn't even realise it was the music video just watched because it was trending,0
why this album Young Thug gotta use other celebrity names?  somebody explain that to me please I don't understand,0
if this is just a little stunt for us to listen to the song and watch the video i'd say well done.,0
Is young thug gay?,0
"Typical celebrity narcissist. He does that because it makes him feel important and powerful. ""Oh, people are working hard to put together a video for me. Whatev. I may or may not show up. I'm too cool, I'm too important, I don't have obligations to other people."" Can't stand such parasites.",0

Fuck Donald trump like if you agree..,1
"wow , young thug a bitch",0
"This video was refreshingly witty! Honestly, a chance to peer into the production and creative process of producing high budget music video like this was already enough to hook me, but it was the humor, the sarcasm, the wastefulness, and the oddity of this story that put it over the top. By the end I felt privy to the magic of video production. This is a win because I can't say I've ever seen something like it. The baddies were a plus.",0
What a straight up savage 🙌🏼🔥,1
esse é Young 😍,0
omg that video was actually amazing. I literally had to listen to it again because I missed the whole song because I was so focused on the video,0
THIS IS ICONIC,0
Can I get 10 subs today,0
"I hate the song, rap music is fucking trash, but I like the video.",0
the director should direct a Lil dicky music video. I'd pay to watch it.,0
"In case you were wondering, 4:18 appears to be an actual slideshow pitch for the first idea Ryan had for this music video. If you pause the video there and press the ""."" and "","" keys on your keyboard you can read it slide by slide. Pretty interesting but not all that original to me.",0
am dead,0
"Can someone make a video without the captions, they really ruin the video",0

"I have a hunch the director ghost write the song ""fuck young thug"" on the album pink life",0
Young Bitch,0
I LOVE the editing on this,0
We watched the video because it was more entertaining than the crap song.,0
"Now everyone from the Fine Bros bout to come and critique this vid. Thug is a genius for making this vid, fuck all the haters.",0
I will be honestly surprised if any one can tell me a line from the first time they watched this not counting let a n*** nut,0
Requiem for a Dream,0
this is hilarious. its even funnier that this is the official video. props to the director,0
This was so fucking clever,0
This is the greatest music video of all time,0
Can't tell you one word from the song though,0
More than happy I watched this,0
ummmm,1
"My mind wanted to dislike this because of the shitty song, but my body... my body enjoyed that video so much",0
"was that movie scene from ""requiem of a dream"" with Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans?",0
Without this director I would have never been able to sit through young thugs terrible rapping,0
Brilliant marketing strategy,0
Somebody has God level photoshop skills,0
Cant trust a rapper,0
This was an elaborate ruse to try and make thugga relevent wake up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
They snapped on he video. And still got paid more than likely. #Message,0
BEST video in years!! I love how present Thugger is w/o barely being in it. I love how you can taste the saltiness in every commentary from the director. They legit turned disaster into art.,0
"Can someone explain this to me? Why would such a controversial video be uploaded on Young Thugs own channel? I'll give you a hint: ""$""",0
how he would fit in a requiem for a dream would been dope,0

Such innovative pleases me,0
legendary,0
I feel like young thug didn't come up with this but at the same time does what goes up on his channel have to be run through him? Because I feel like he wouldn't care to REALLY control what goes on his channel,0
"3:20 yes, it's Requiem for a Dream.",0

Young Thug Lives Do Not Matter,0
This is the greatest thing to happen in 2017 and will carry on in history to be the greatest moment,0
this is so funny,0
wtf,1
this video is a fucking masterpiece.,0
i think this video is better whithout young thug,9
"""i want alotta bitches. a lot of hoes"" i wonder how these RESPECTABLE ACTRESS felt when they seen this video.
its funny this is the type of people sjw's, feminists, tyt, mtv and vice stand up for and promote, while claiming white men are sexist, racist and evil. smh
and this comment is in no way me putting black people as a whole down. i know plenty of white people who act like this type of trash and also know plenty of great respectable black people whether from the streets or upper class neighborhoods.
This guy is just retarded, prob doesnt even realize how bad this video makes him look and prob doesnt care. this is what kids are looking up to these days. 
i grew up loving hiphop too and its sad to see it turn to shit. is this even hiphop anymore? And yea i know even in my day hiphop (mainly gangtsa rap) wasnt so lady friendly either, but man everything about this is awful.",0

GENIUS MOVE! :D,0
i dont like young thug but this was good,18
"I may not like the music, but the video was kinda funny",1
props to the director tho,0
"sub to my channel if you fucks with young thugga, report video if you hate him. lets see how many fans really out here",0
The only thing I got from this is that I wish I could blow 100 grand and just fuck off to somewhere else and probably blow another grand on black jack and hookers.,0
yt u the man! fuck that hacking as bitch,0
fuck all day reading shit,0
now we need to hear Young Thug's story on this,0
So everything is shit about this,0
"For me this is just the director and producers... people that worked hard making it, slapping his face for his idioticic  behavior and the label for backing him up... WHILE being paid... it is the ultimate trolling.

Showing how people that produce things in the industry have to deal with really over-the-top situations thanks to douches.",0
"As terrible a rapper thugger is,  this video is genius",0
such an original video love the humor,0
cade os Br?💣,0
"I don't get why he didn't show up , lowkey look like a fun video to film",1
Am I crazy for actually liking this video?,1
video is the best part.,0
fye but funny wit dat commentary,0
good!!,0
"Oh god this is literally the best video ever, I am crying tears of laughter right now. FML",0
Felt like I was watching a Key of Awesome parody. A very high budget and well directed Key of Awesome parody.,1
the guy who edited this video clip is a genius!!,0
dead,0
Great video,0
I see why thug snapped on dem nappy head hoes at the airport.. this what he been late fo...,0
this is a publicity stunt.. a good one too haha,1
I do not think young thug is smart enough to plan the video like this so probs to the co director! but you gotta give him credit he watched it I mean  his people put it up they knew it was a hit!! good video,0
make something from nothing,0
can thugg actually call women women instead of everything other? lol he's had it too good for too long...he needs a turning point 😐😑,0
I like this song not as a rap or hip hop song but as a nice mellow chill song,0
what if this is what young thug wanted as the video 🤔,1
"I wanted to listen to this song because I thought it was by Wyclef Jean and I thought the song was called Young Thug, but its the complete opposite. And this is trash lol.",0
GENIOUS,0
"I wish that the concept of the video was actually a ""failed"" video because that would have been genius. Sadly, I don't think Young Thug is that clever to think of so. Props to the director and editor though.",0
This is so weird 😂 I was more focused on the text in the video than the music,0
OMG very good ideia.,0
only people who listened to this on its release like,1
what a little tranny bitch diva,0
Lol,0
"You are king , you are god . My Broooooooooo :)",0
It was dope,0
LOL,0
"if anyone cares, the ""ass to ass"" reference is from the movie Requiem for a Dream",827
"A wonderful video by Ryan Staake.  BTW, who's Young Thug?  I dunno, but Ryan Staake's still has a carrier ahead of himself.  But given the channel Young Thug will get the credit.",0
People do realize young thug didn't show up for a reason this video is extremely smart he's trying to show that when a video is different you won't even realize what happening,0
This is so much better than if Young Thug would have actually showed up.,2738
Damn that's just to show how selfish fame and money can make you,13
😂😂😂,1
someone explain this,0
This was mumbling waste of time.  Or Diz uh waza mummlin wayzuh tieuhmmmuhmuh uh.,1
This is what you call art,0
"Honestly though, who says this whole thing wasn't the original concept? It's genius. That, and if this wasn't the concept why would it be marked as the official video. The artist wouldn't put his music over so,etching he didn't approve of and mark it as official. All you sheep need to calm down and quit thinking you're bad because you call the rapper a diva. I don't even listen to him, but it's a genius concept and there's a chance he was in on it.",0
"this video highlights the problem with modern rappers and why they should never be associated with HipHop. Bring back the real shit that rebellious social commentary that made us laugh and think with the illest beat makers on MPCs choppin up old vinyl records... ill never understand how hype sells more than humility, originality or content. Its like this shit is meant to purposely divide society into different tribes.",0
WTF,0
"Well, this is clearly just an artistic stunt he pulled to get views, but very clever and very cool, and that's coming from someone who listens to literally none of his music. This was a lot of fun to watch lol. A dead giveaway for me is, well, why would a bunch of real cops be standing by tending to a rap video of people smashing a very old, way out of service cop car?",0
Can you make this video without the words and text? It would be cool!,0
ASS TO ASS ASS TO ASS,0
"Just the way young thug kept referring to the models as bitches left a bad taste in my mouth

Good video though, I hope it's real and not just a marketing stunt",6
"Men Fuck Young Thug, and Fuck this trend of mumble rappers. The culture of hip hop is dying. Artists like Isaiah Rashad or Joey Bada$$ deserves this attention, not this lil ass niggas. If pac or big could see were hip hop is going they will thank god they are dead.",1

"Honestly, it was funny. the level of done Ryan the ""co-director"" was with everything XD. The sarcasm in the text screens. The editing and how the video flowed being top noch. its not my favorite genre to listen too and i didnt know what he is even singing but this video made me laugh so theres that.",1
This is genius literally didn't realise that the song was playing because I was caught up in the production story until the end where you realised this was the music video (I watched this somewhere else so didn't know it was an actual music video just an explanation video),22

How much pussy you can be that you dont get out of the car because your instgram was hacked!? dafuk.,0
I am a creative director and this is a great concept for a video. I know some people may feel like the reading is too much but I enjoyed it. It was an interesting story that built up. It's very artistic and different. Hip-Hop videos tend to be a bit generic and basic. I enjoyed seeing a departure from the typical rap music video aesthetic. The documentary feel to it made me feel like I got to see a new glimpse of the world of a rap superstar. Great job Pomp&Clout.,0

reading these comments after Watchingn the video.... first of the director is shit pissed that young thug didn't even have the manners to show up! Not professional at all. Secondly... it's obvious that rap has fallen so low on the music scale that fans of this rapper actually think this is a good song. i say this to reiterate that 3/4 of our society it's still asleep.

I feel like all this reading is supposed to distract us from the song. it's almost like even they didn't want us to pay attention to his music.,1
best young thug video ever bc i didnt see his ugly face,1
anyone know who the chick on the left is at 3:15,0
lol love it,0

Bo po arvoredo!,0
Congrats Ryan. This is true art. Well done. You are a fuckin` modern master. Lol,0
fucking genius.,0
"1st time watching the video and I can say this is the very 1st time i've ever watched a music video and was so intrigued by the story that I had to pause it multiple times throughout the entire duration... just to keep up with the captions and really follow what was happening, lpl... this is hilarious... and very unique... very REAL. I think its awesome that they fed us the actual story of what went wrong... walked us through the brainstorm... he displayed his sketches for some of the shots. As much of a clusterfuck as this is... its still dope... because there's a story behind it. Great humor. I Love this song, btw. And Young Thug is a musical genius. That is all.",2
"make the viewer read about the artist they want to hear but barely see in the video, smart. It really actually kept me watching this is somewhat genius",0
S,0
This video is stupid and him explaining it made it even more stupid maybe he should have just let it play like that without explaining,0
Hey,0
"thugger is one of the smartest artist, he got on top of toppest in music industry in a flash, he keeps people talking about him and watching his stuff, even if they hate, thugger gets payed becouse every eye his on him everytime. Thugger is a smart artist and real props to editor and producer if this is a real history in the video. What a smart way to turn things around and get payed. Remember its all about 💰",0
kinda sound like lil wayne in some parts from years ago,0
"what a sick fuck for putting kids in this ""music"" video about nutting on women's faces and having scantily clad women dance around the kids. Everyone associated in the production in this video are deplorables.",1
this was the best thing ever,1
why the fuck did I get a notification for this shit?  I'm not subscribed to young thug.  or any kind of punk thug whatever rapper bullshit.  keep it up google.,0
Algum Brasileiro?,0
this is surprisingly very interesting good job,1
"love the fact that the director is shining a light on this particular part of the industry, slot of music videos today offer little to no insight on the side of production, or the director's perspective. This was very refreshing and honest. 100k flushed down the toilet all because of a spoiled rich mediocre Artist ( if you can even call him that).",0
ur music sucks,0
This is funny as fuck😂 lol love him,1
Young Thug is such a piece of shit,9
Finalmente o video da melhor musica do album 💜💙❤💜💙❤💙💜,2
Y'all are hating but to think that this song is up with a music video means that Young Thug agreed to this music video and wanted it to go up as it was. Yeah he didn't do the set when he got there but I'm sure you all would be pissed if some dick hacked your social media to say you weren't going to a set and made you late for it. This here is fucking dope and mad respect to Young Thug for improvising after the original plans had gone to trash. Himself and Ryan Staake have done a fantastic job here! Well done guys this music video is freaking lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥,0
ART,0
lol that was funny,0
I CANT BREATHE,0
Oh shit i zoned out the song cause i was to busy reading the captions Fuck time to watch it again,1

"This is proof a good/smart/creative music video can bring so much more to a song.  On my first watch, (i say watch), i barely even heard the song because the video was so enticing and hilarious! Second time i watched the music video i listened out to the song and i hated it. I tried to listen through the ridiculous auto-tune; which is now reserved for kanye and t-pain only, and done my best to listen to the lyrics which are barely fathomable... My point is, i've watched this music video about 6 times now, i love the video, because of that i've started to enjoy the song - not for the mumble shit (insert: j cole - everybody dies) just the decent beat and production. So! Thank you for making this - really, really great work but, fuck you for making me listen to a young thug song 6 times!",0

what does wyclef Jean even mean,0
"Okaaayyy 💀Let's get is straight. The majority of the people commenting on here don't understand any of the terms used in the video or today's music. A woman is someone who is gonna take care of her man, while a bitch is someone who you either just fw for fun or it's someone who screws you over the whole time y'all are ""together."" Now... to the people complaining about his music - if you don't like it, then why listen to it? why watch the video? we all know who the real idiot is now - YOU! Today's hip hop is obviously different from what was around in the early 00s and 90s. All music is different from what it used to be! Literally ALL music is different! So once again, if all you're going to do is complain and talk about how ""trash"" it is, then just stop watching the videos and listening to the music. I'm sure you have something better to be doing with your life.",0

This guy made the video he probably appreciated the sarcastic humor and probably laughed himself and said fuck it this is amazing. Don't act like young thug is some idiot who ""didn't watch the video"" or is some diva  or whatever. Not dick riding but yeah.",0

"Please someone explain how Hillary was worse then trump trump has ripped off small businesses he has refused to rent apartments to blacks and wrongly accused the South Park 5 of rape even when they were proven innocent he also refused to condemn the KKK newspaper that supported him did a mention the freaking KKK supports him his whole campaign he has spewed false statistics on black crime check his Twitter he also has called women bitches whores fat ugly disgusting horrible cunts he suggested that women would get equal pay as long as they ""worked as hard"" employing that they don't work hard enough to deserve equal pay for equal work he mocked a disabled man said John wasn't a war hero said that army members with ptsd are wimps said that he likes to sexually assault women on that tape he said Mexicans were rapists and drug dealers his businesses take advantage and sometimes steal other people's property not to mention several women including a cnn reporters  friend have come forward accusing him of sexual assault he didn't pay taxes for like 10 yrs he has proposed a deportation force not to mention his foundation which is dedicated to paying himself money an example would be his foundation payed for a party that was hosted at one of his resort houses that's not legal btw also his supporters compare peaceful protests to KKK bonfires not to mention many of his supporters are affiliated with the altright movement which Steve bannan the chief of staff has said he is the platform of the altright is a news organization that reports ultra conservative sometimes actually mostly racist sexist media with headlines like would u rather ur child have feminism or cancer? Or false statistics on black crime his son retweeted a picture of him with skittles and compared them to Syrian refugees he said Muslims everywhere celebrated when 9 11 hit he and most of his supporters say and think Muslims are terrorists he suggested banning Muslims from entering the country which is against religious freedom that goes against the constitution he insulted a gold star family  his supporters constantly harass minority students at school sometimes in the more extreme cases they have actually stalked and beaten up innocent students my point is we cannot have these false equivalencies where extreme rioters are equal to the freaking KKK or where watergate is equal to being endorsed by the KKK Newspaper or Bill clintons scandals are equal to calling women pigs and whores and refusing to let rape victims get abortions I understand why people hate Hillary I hate her to i definitely wouldn't have voted for her but I don't see how trump is a viable option if you don't want to be called a racist or a sexist or someone who hates immigrants or other religions then u shouldn't have voted for trump otherwise u are those things u endorse his behavior by voting for him idgaf if u think Hillary is worse vote for Gary or any other contender and I understand why people think democrats are elitist or racist also but the left while still bad is nowhere near coming close to how racists sexist homophobic islamaphobic xenophobic etc the right is my point is do research before making false comparisons and not to mention the fbi director helping trump by falsely accusing Hillary's aid of hiding more emails or the fact that the entire government and the president agree the Russians hacked our election so trump could win the list goes on so I dare u to tell me exactly how Hillary is worse using exactly as many examples as I did...I'm waiting",1

The director is pretty lit to be honest I don't think anyone could've thought of this as an idea except for him,0
If you don't realize that this video was supposed to be like this for the comedic effect then you're an idiot,0
this made me more interested in the directors work than Young Thug's tbh,0

"So Young Thug is a punk, who makes songs that have zero to do with the title and has a management crew from hell. The group that made the video is entirely awesome. Best part was when he points out that they wanna censor him but YT can say whatever...",0
Not enuff tits and cunts,0
This dude was low key dissing Young Thug,3316
i didnt even care about young thug but this guy is great,43
I think the girls on and in the kiddie cars made the video look kinda stupid. They should have done the whole video with kids with a few kid friendly changes to the scenes instead of having just the cops be kids. And have the girls be hitting the cop car with foam or plastic bats but damaging it like we see what their imagination sees. It would have made the video more fun and less awkward.,0
"I find myself walking around now saying ""Nascar race"" out of nowhere to nobody. Sign of mental illness or just becoming a Young Thug fan? Trick question, they are the same thing.",0
One of the most creative music videos on planet Earth and the song is pretty good,0
3:12,0
Fuck anybody hating on this,0
"I like how uptight people are getting about this. Lol, loosen up honestly.",0
"black males find black females least attractive and worship light skin woman, lol",2
lowkey its not that bad compared to his other music,0
"This song slaps, seems like a frustrating situation, i have some respect for young thug for putting this video up on his account. Like he is showing the world what he did, its basically an apology, but also clever in that this is getting a shit ton of traction so now this song is probably getting double the views than it normally would",0

"I don't know why everyone hates the song. It has a nice beat and a decent drop. The lyrics might not be the most appropriate, but they're what the author wanted the song to symbolize. The video was also lovely and creative but it does show how unappreciative young thug is of time and money and how he is oblivious to reality.",0
"Dats a bingo!  👀

this pop artist sucks,0
I bet this video turned out better then if Young Thug would have shown up. Too bad all the reading took away from it. Maybe Young Thug should stop acting like a diva.,1031
"It's sad that all these rappers (Young Thug, Lil Yachty, Future) get famous because people mostly like the catchy and turnt beat that the producers made, but then the rappers just yell over it with random ass lyrics and they get all the credit.

Not to mention they probably got ghost writers for the shit lyrics too. So they pretty much do nothing and still get all the money and fame.




I feel like it should be the norm to include the producers as a ""ft."", like any song DJ Khaled is in.",0

I only hope you were planning to burn fake money, because burning perfectly good cash that could help tons of people is gross and wrong on every level.

Love it or Hate it, this is what we have to offer. And by the way, he's not mumbling, you guys just don't understand what he's saying. You act like he's speaking another language. Go pull up the lyrics. It may be a shit song to you now, but trust me, this is gonna be a classic years later, just like many songs this decade.",11

"yo!!! this sht got so deep for a song that's not deep at all that it made me like the video more than what it would have been.. so shouts to the people who put the commentary in/words, the explanation of what he wanted and all made this cool. gives you an inside look at the artist mind and the way the industry looks at it,  as well as what is lost behind scenes that we the fans or media never sees ..... not sure if this was planned but, great flip to a cool video.. however YOU FKN IDIOT.. YOU SHOULD'VE ENDED IT RIDING OUT IN ONE OF THEM CARS WITH THEM 2 KID COPS CHASING YOU RIGHT AFTER THEY SAID COPS STOPPED IT... IMO 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💯💯💯💯",0

I kinda like the song too,0
"who is this song made for? 
women? your girlfriend? your fellow guy friends? I mean, Sure. You can go ahead and create a song like this, spend time and effort etc, but then when you show others, the first reaction I connect with is that of boredom. ''i was bored''. Totally justifies this song.. if it was a quality song, it wouldn't need a video like this. 
Thumbs up if you're <16 and listening to a song with naughty words and nudish ladies in! You Savage, you. ;)",0

"It's fake, the director has given interviews about it already.

""The way this came about once the whole disaster shoot wrapped is pretty interesting. I really put together an entire third treatment in this process because, as the video points out, there was this initial idea of lighting the money on fire. Which I was planning to actually do, I was just going to withdraw it in ones and look into some of the legal ramifications and just go for it.

Then there was the second idea, which was the idea we set out to do. Then there was a third idea, which was another treatment that said we don’t have anything, but what we do have is some good moments, but there wasn’t anything with Thug. I didn’t have enough to make a video. I kind of lightly hypothesized what some of the scenes might be, and how I would describe some of this stuff. In the presentation I even had a page that talked about the media reception of it, and how I thought people would take this. I mocked up a browser window and I actually used complex.com and made this fake title that said something like “Young Thug’s Video Came Out And He Wasn’t Even In It.” Isn’t Even In His Own Video. [Ed note—we went with “Young Thug’s Video For “Wyclef” Jean Isn’t What You’d Expect”]. Something to the effect of what people are running with now. We just wanted to give the people reading it a sense of context for what it might be received as.""",0

New rap and especially trap is supposed to be completely different from that old school shit just like how a pop song from the 2010s doesn't sound like 50's doowop n shit. Judging all music from the standard of a bunch of niggas from 1994 who weren't as good as you think is stupid af. Get out of here with that fuck shit n let people enjoy things",0

You don't go to the club bumping to mobb deep, I mean, true that future, migos, young thug take less skill to like and understand but that's why it's generally more popular then the songs produced by say, Naz. you can just bump you're head to today's music and dance. It's more about how fun it is less then how deep the text goes. I mean, I think it's a nice change of pace don't you think? I don't wanna listen to really serious texts about killing, suicide and depression (even though I very much like the old school rappers). 
You just gotta dig a little deeper to find the 'quality' songs nowadays",0

"For all of you to expect deeper meanings and lyricism and all of that Bullshit from Young Thug or any other Trapper get that corny talk out of here.

I like Earl Sweatshirt, Joey Bada$$, Mac Miller, Danny Brown and other rappers who care about lyrics as much as you might. But Trap is lets have some ignorant, joyous, and stupid fun! No better meaning than that. 

Motherfucking Fun, all of the rap stereotypes and in between. Fucking Bitches, Getting Money, Doing Drugs, Buying shit, and Flexing on those who you might not like. 

So if you care about lyrics so much go show your appreciation to YOUR favorite rappers of how much you love there music.

Young Thug being himself. He made it. Let him spread the mindless vibes of fun.

But Young Thug still needa respond to Pink Guy after that diss. Don't stay silent Thugger!! 😂",0

"Producer did his part and some on this video, and the amazing effort and creativity of all aspects combined made this original gem. It's a good thing he didn't get in that last scene, or any scene, because this video would be so far from #1 trend most that are here wouldn't have seen or heard it, at least for a while anyway. So great job at turning shit into partially melted chocolate ice cream with hunks of brownies, fudge and cookie crumble with that chocolate syrup that gets hardened from ice cream contact served out of a pure gold bowl that your already bringing to ""Gold n' Pawn"" for a nice fat wad of cash you weren't even expecting 15 minutes prior but then there it was, that bowl had a shine on it glaring from the sun that made the ice cream that was inside of it weep with fudgesicles of love",0

What the hell did i just watch,0
For those getting offended by Young Thug calling women bitches and hoes. A rapper like Young Thug calls women bitches and hoes because he's used to seeing bitches and hoes... He has every right to call a bitch a bitch because I bet most of the women he's been around with only want him for his money and fame and he knows it. I bet that nigga didn't get bitches till he got famous.,1

So basically Young Thug didn't give a fuck about you guys. Yet you managed to make a video for him? Real determination 💯,145

"Throughout the comment section i see people arguing about which era had the best music or music artists or the infamous ""back in my day quotes."" Truth be told each era of music is unique in its own way my parents grew up on the pioneers of hip hop but yet their parents used to talk about ""back in my day we had real music not this tupac and biggie noise"" now that those 90s teens are now grown adults they talk about our artists just like they parents talked about theirs. Its a generational things that inevitably we are most like do the same in about 20 years with our kids. Theres no stoping it. I agree theres a huge difference between lyrical rap and mumble rap or nonsense rap, but dont bash one or the other let people like what the fuck they wanna like. If you fw kendrick and cole then fw them dont hate on another artists cause they not doing what you want or want them to do. This video got 2M views in less than 24hrs. Moral of the story is if you don't like the music don't listen or watch stick to wha you like man. Everybody and every era is different. They said hip hop wouldn't last this long but yet its rising and rising just appreciate it.",2

It's not gonna stop. *update not saying all hip hop is bad but this is not hip hop. this is my opinion and I'm not forcing anyone to say/believe anything and I am not hating on the artist or anyone who likes his music.""


That's why me and many artists alike stick to the underground. I know god damn well that it will change me, somehow or another. If not consciously, subconsciously.",1

Thank God I'm not black,6
i'll never know why its trending. the fucking video has to have explainations on wtf is going on. i know kids are lacking grades but is this how they're getting them to learn how to read? c'mon,0
"Oh fuck off all you old farts talking about how good your music was. There is some great music that my generation listens to that don't get on the radio though some of it does. Stop slandering the music my generations listens to. All you guys had was NWA,biggie,PAC and a few others that a good and that's it. Your music with funky ass beats sucks. This song isn't great but it's your average party song",0
It's so funny seeing all the white people that have no clue what they're talking about in the comments. They think they understand an entire culture from watching a rap music video for the first time,0
Garbage not even music,2
still looking,0
Sounds amazing on mute,1
I don't know about shutting it down. I'd be more about flushing it down.,0
I can't tell if this is a spoof or a producer throwing shade,0
"The music is so shit, but the music video is great.",3
Watched the video to read what you wrote....song still sucks dick.,0
"And the ""ass to ass"" scene is from Requiem For a Dream. AMAZING flick.",1

"oh shit boy, i think hes talking about requiem for a dream there when hes talking about the ass to ass. ahh, the memories, the childhood horror of watching it, good times",0
IM IN FUCKING LOVE W ALL THE AD LIBS IN THIS SONG,0
"Every little dimwits down in the comment section is complaining about how this song lacks substance, this generation sucks or rap is misogynistic. Bitching about those shit doesn't make you smart nor a good person, stop lying to yourself. This is a well performed and well-produced feel good track and the video is funny and creative, but some people are just so self-absorbed to see that.",0
what did i just watch and hear?,1
10/10 video and dialoge. 5/10 vocals. 1000/10 girls ;),0
omg i loved this,0
"Why is everybody bitching? ""Back in my day blah blah blah"" This music video is better than the typical hip hop music video that features strippers and money. It even makes fun of itself with the ""impressionable children"" part. Can you all pull your heads out your asses?",0
If you want funny stupid challenge and DIY videos I'm the youtuber for you,0
"This is not music. I'd rather listen to my fingernails scratch a chalk board. And for you trolls, no ""I'm not here listening to it"" I had it paused my while I took time during my peaceful shit in the bathroom to share this thought.",0
차가 귀여워서 끝까지 본 뮤비 ㅎㅎ,0

😂lol where are all these Young Thug haters coming from? If you don't like his music why did you click on the video???,1
Thugger has truly mastered the art of not giving a f*ck,0
I didn't like the song but the video was still entertaining,1
This is the number one trending video right now. young thug garbage as fuck. kid cudi would murder  this fool in a rap battle.,0
talk all you want about the music. the video is dope af,0
it sounds like lil Wayne in the beginning,0
This is #1 in trending. For good reason. The commentary is hilarious.,0
all the comments are about how trash this generation is and a bunch of old heads,0
why am i on the weird part of YouTube again?,1
"I swear most of the haters on the video really doesn't understand anything. Young Thug is far from trash he's been respected in the game. His lyrics might be sub par but he gets his credit in his remarkable flow. His flow is interesting as hell its not the same as others. Not every hip hop song needs to convey a fucking message. Different artists do different shit. If im driving artists like young thug or future are perfect for the environment. However ever chilling in bed that's not the case. People just need to give this new shit a chance and TRY TO ENJOY THE MUSIC. Most of yall see Young in the artists name and click on the video thinking ""this shit is gonna be some mumble rap trash""  like what??",0
old song,1
what is this garbage? disliked,0
"For all the complete and utter dumbasses out there, this isn't trending because of the damn song, it's trending because of the video. Young Thug literally never showed up to shoot his own video and so the director put this out. It's pretty fucking funny.",0
this is so trash,0
I don't care whether this is fake or real. This is a masterpiece.,0
Here before it explodes.,0
"Okay, the song sucks, but this music video is actually fantastic.",0
"this is garbage, NWA was garbage, and everyone now days are narcissist.",0
"I'm dead, this is my new favourite thing ever.",0
i really enjoyed this.,0
props to the director and creative team behind this...,0
Young thug is a cancer to music.,28
"The music was pure shit, but you gotta admit the video is pretty funny.",0
MASTERPIECE,0
It's 2017 and this crap is still getting pumped out. What the fuck even is a young thug? Load of fucking generic bullshit.,0
I like my own comment to get the ball rolling,2
"this is what is setting blacks back 10000 years....  martin luther king would be ashamed of you nasty greasy fried chicken eatin muthafuckers..  from now on, i only want to associate with new age rewired blacks, period.  simple as that...",0
This is lowkey so creative,1216
Fake and gay,1
I've taken shits with better word clarity than young thug,2
im honestly not convinced this was planned I think this director is just a genius,0
"It's sad that people now days have nothing better to do than be on their phone 24/7, and when they do do something in real life they have to post it to snap-chat or facebook. Back in my day we did stuff with our hands and worked all our free-time just so we could have money to support ourselves and have a living. This was actual stress we endured. So now days, it's actually hilarious when people are bummed out because they didn't get as many likes as they wanted on facebook, or other social media platforms.",0
Beat dropped so hard... Life alert couldnt save my grandmothers ass,3
haters are doing the most...clicking on a video they know they won't like then have the damn energy to say the video is trash. 😒,1
"Fucking trash music, this guy a gay ass bitch",0

"something wrong with society. bad language, kids smashing police cars with big boob dirty women. bad bad bad influence.  this is like the cancer for society.",0
"i really did want to see the video. They're pretty cool occasionally, although I didn't listen to the song, I heard it.",0
"I was once had an encounter with The Almighty Thor. That dude is Mighty as Fuck! He was about 8 foot tall, and was yoked as Fuck! He would make Arnold Schwarzenegger look like a little bitch. He also, had a badass beard. But, the thing that stood out the most was his hammer ( an actual hammer not his cock) it was so fucking powerful looking. But for some reason He told me, that he wanted take his hammer ( again an actual hammer not his cock)  and fucking crush Kim kardashian. He can't fucking stand her! He thinks she is a fake ass (literally) no talented skank. Now, I fearfully agreed with him, even though I'd probably fuck her, but I didn't want to get crushed, But, overall Thor is one badass God! I'm so glad he revealed himself to me.",1
stupid fucking music black music,0

"Wow we Americans make the best music (we also created the music industry) but, we also create the lamest music too. Fuck this gay shit.",0

"How the fuck is this #1 on trending right now like seriously what the fuck happened to hip hop, it's all mumbling rappers nowadays but I give credits to the producers because that's the only thing that makes these guys songs sound good.. which is the best.",2
"Kudos to you keeping it professional!!!!! But this mutha fucka is the exact reason why rap is meaningless today! Words actually meant sumthin back in the day. Now they just justifying the government's anti rap movement from the 80's! Plus he makes both men seem like assholes, as well as defining rappers as complete assholes without any meaning!!!!!! NWA? Pac? Nas? Common? Talib Kweli? Public Enemy? The Roots? And even Eminem? This is exactly why rap and hip hop is no longer an art form. It's all about the money baby! And FUCK Young Thug!",0
"I hate the music, but I love the fuckin editors, so do I like or dislike the video?",0
The fuck type of video is this,0
Bru.....where the lyrics at I don't understand not one word this Nigga is saying.,0
I don't care for the music but the video was pretty funny.,11
For best experience turn volume OFF,0
"Interesting video idea. I've never seen a video that explains all the background work of trying to make the video and almost having it not come to fruition. It seems kinda lazy at first glance, but it was actually done very well and actually pretty funny.",0
What garbage. Hopefully those kids grow up and realise that someday.,0
Good video for a lame song.,0
This is amazing,0
Dudes in the comments are weird as fuck,1

the editing in this Vid was more enjoyable than the singing,0
3:03 pedofile,0
FUCK YES IT WORKED! congratulations,0
"I'm not liking this video for he trash ass song. I'm liking it because the director had to deal with a artist that is a complete fucking diva and a snob, didn't even show up to the fucking shoot, and yet still was creative enough to make an awesome music video out of it. Probs to the director. Young thug a bitch for that tho",0

"This video was produced by someone with a micro-penis. As  clinical psychology tells us, the smashing of the police car (authoritative imperative) is indicative of feelings of inferiority that has its origin in early childhood penis shaming and from this shaming stems the resentment of the police. Years ago police were made to give up their phallic shaped Billy clubs because of the subconscious angst they evoked in adult males with smaller than average genitalia. The smashing of the police cars is a method of acting out against the shame. Most of today's race riots and other violent public demonstrations that include attacking inanimate authority figures assuages the self-loathing and the principle reason why police are routinely ordered to stand down and allow the venting process to proceed unimpeded. Otherwise those deficient men will raise the level of violence to include homicide and other serious crime. The sacrificing of a squad car or two has been deemed a loss prevention measure.",0

"""Hurr durr fuck mumble rap I only listen to real hip-hop"" man shut the fuck up this isn't for you then, Young Thug moves records and has a fan base by just being himself.

"This is our ""popular"" music nowadays. No meaning, disgusting, mumbling , talentless garbage. Same message- girls bodies,sex,drugs,money and that's what we call music. It's not gonna stop. *update not saying this genre of music is bad but this doesn't even fit into a genre except for him mumbling. anyone who agrees with anything he's saying you are a disgrace. I'm honestly laughing at how people think this is ""art"".",1103
"Black people make up 13% of the population but commit 52% of all murders. Cut that down to young black men and you have about 5% of the population. 

5% of the population commits 52% of the murders. That's over half. A small section of a small ethnic group kills more people in this country than every other group combined. 

Let me put it another way. 

Black people killing other black people account for over half of all murders in this country despite them making up such a small percentage of the population. 

Now, as young black men die left and right in the streets of Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis at a significant rate, we're supposed to be impressed by this same old thug life bullshit?!

Well you're not going to save any black lives until you can speak honestly about what's going on in your own community instead of blaming white people and police officers.

Oh, and BTW, black women are more than 5 times as likely as white women to have an abortion.

Black lives matter, yo!",0

"Bondage...Requiem for a Dream....Yung Thug is a such a pathetic starlit fuck, who is spoon fed way too much.  The real reason he didn't get out the car, is because the cops were there and probably wanted to arrest him for his outstanding warrants! Believe it!",0

this more of a comedy vid than a music vid😂😂😂😂😂,1
this could have been the greatest video of all fucking time if we're being fucking honest,10
100% fucks with the pointless video,0
That was pretty awesome...being told the schematics of the whol;e video kept me very entertained...whether this was planned or not ive never liked young thug till now,0
One of the best music videos ever!,1
"I wonder if this actually happened, or if this was just a really clever idea for a music video.",14
Happy cardboard day,0
young thug is the Michael Jackson of rap. this is one of my favorite songs,0
Requiem for a dream! is the ass to ass movie.,0

1:17 who,0
lmao i wanna follow the director of this music video. funny as fuck.,0
If anything Pomp&Clout deserve all the shine for taking nothing and turning it into something that made you want to watch the whole video. Thugger chomping on Cheetos and showing up just to leave was far more entertaining than it was creative.,0
"thuuggeerr, you should totally make a guwop music video with scooter an quavo an offset cause thats my favourite song on your album no my name is jeffery besides this song, zoo could you , cause that'd be super liitt",0

greatest music video of all time,0
caralho man pesado essa trap pqp,0
"This video is fucking hilarious!

"If this was planned, he's a genius tho.",2170

Young Thug the type of nigga to slap his bitch for having on tighter jeans,0
1:44 soooo cute,0
rap artists and pop artists are just a bunch of 12 year old drama queens that make shitty music that cry for attention,1
So the moral of this music video is that Thugger is a flake?,0
i have difficulties on concentrate to the song cause of the writing,0
That's the kind of professionalism you get when dealing with sub-80 IQ ghetto trash...,0

Best video this year 💯 and lets not forget the song itself is fire 🔥 🔥 🔥,1
"This video kind of worked. I had it sent to me by a friend and about half way through I figured that was how it was going to end, but I also realized I'm just reading and not listening to the song at all. Even between the typed words I was just thinking to myself about what's being said and still not listening to the music. I couldn't even hum the rhythm after the song if I wanted to. So yeah you got my click and my view, but I have no idea what that song was and have no more plans to look into the music after I see it's all taken as a joke anyway. that's just honest feedback, not hating.",0

"Everyone saying Thug is a dick but he approved of this vid. Wouldnt be surprised if all of this was fake and the acc concept of the vid was to make a vid about a vid that never happened. Make sense? Regardless if its all fake or not, this vid is still more creative than what could've been. How many times have we seen rappers burn mountains of cash in vids and drive cars with thicc bitches",1
"he sounds like a stuck up bitch "" i want bitches and hoes"" wheres the fucking respect",363
"He didn't show his swag in this clip, but it's still motherfuckin' viral.",0

"Rap & HipHop is garbage. Always has been, always will be. 

African Americans have been some of the most positive influences in music and its evolution. Blues, MoTown, R&B, Rock&Roll, etc... wouldn't be the same without.

However... Rap and HipHop are crude,lame, played out, regressive, demeaning, racist, mind-numbingly repetitious, and most infuriating of all.. ITS SOOOO EASY TO DO!! 

People are literally worshipping these ignorant, uneducated, sorry-ass poets.. I mean they aren't even trying to make poetry.. they're just regurgitating the same played message. 

Rap is for children. Watch!..
1.Make a percussion rhythm and loop it.
2.Add synth sounds so it's not like your rivals track.
3.Write a ""rap"" using words that almost rhyme, if no word exists to make a rhyme.. make up a word that sounds similar and give definition later. 
4. Make a billion burned copies
5. Have millions interpret your made up words and rap however suits them best and then argue and fight over it. 

Remember kids if you don't have any actual talents or skills to draw upon ,ANYONE CAN BE A RAPPER.",0
Worst voice ever,0
this was perhaps one of the greatest sagas to ever happen in a music video. I was hooked the whole way through,1

Lol good video,0
"probably the best and most creative video I've seen in regards to Young Thug. Vids... no disrespect to his other videos and videographers, but the way these guys pulled this shit together without him in the video, I could only imagine what it would have been like with him in it...#keep doing your thing fellas",0
"Well regardless of thoughts on YT's skill or lack thereof, this video is interesting...",0
young thug a pussy,0
Obviously it's fake. It's on his YouTube channel.,0
where did he mention wyclef jean,0
Dopest video I've seen in a while,0
nice vid lol,1
I don't see what's the hype..he didn't show (slowly commiting career suicide) but I give up most respect to whomever did the video still.💯,0
"Not sure what they were going for, but it sucks.",0
Who else stop the video just so you can read the text😂😂,1
I honestly didn't know who this burnt q-tip was until today.,0
I didn't know there was music in the background till the end.,0
"Fake, they planned it to be exactly like this from the get go",1
Young thug sounds like a spoiled bitch,0
"i love this video, it matches the song and is very humorous. i hope it wins a grammy next year tbh",0
"Haha, the video maker snitched on Thugga fo bein a diva. He's the Madonna of hip hop.",0
i think the backgrounds stupid but i dig listening to it,0
LIL C NOTE IN DIS WHERE HIS WIFE,0
A better way to do it would have been to explain the process then at the very end let the audience know thugger never did end up making an appearance.,0
"Lowkey genius though.
This video is going to talked about and spread, its all that matters really.",0
funny ass video lmao,0
thugger looks like the type of kid that cried for something till he get it,0
Why can I see this totally being fake and just an attempt for the video to go viral,1
This shit was hella creative,0
This is a godlike video,0
this is just great,0
garbage,0
fucking genius,0
"What's the ""ass to ass"" reference??",0
"so what the fuck did you spend 100k on, it sure as fuck wasnt this video",13

Im not even a Fan of Young Thug ... but this video is genius ...,0
SICK LUKE SICK LUKE,0

Was not expecting this. Had to add it to the Favorites.,0

"Beyonce once Beyoncé would have never played herself like this about her ART , but at the same time this is ART omg I'm mind blown and the creativity from both Directors",0

is a better video because of it.,0
"Video might have worked but I left it on mute the entire time and just read, so it didn't entirely work in the same aspect as you hoped.",0
"Love Thugger but this young director deserved much better. You can't make it to a shoot in less than 10 hours? You can't get out of your car because your too emotional that your fucking instagram got hacked? Fuck outta here nigga, that shit is for females. Did becoming famous turn you in to a retard who can't do anything like an adult? This seriously lowers my respect for Thug. He got too many people around him treating him like justin bieber. This Nigga needs to man up and start getting shit done like a man. How fucking hard is it to show up for a little bit and basically hang around a bunch of bitches while someone films it? Like goddamn Thugger. Come on nigga, you fucking slipping.",0
young thug should practice more on his writing and pronunciation skills,0
"song was garbage, but what do u expect. video was great. keep up the work.",0
"Man fuck young thug, I thought this video would be wild and got excited when I saw the notification",0
this was crazy.,0
"Say what you want, but this video kept me hooked in a way that most don't. I actually watched to the very end, which is extremely rare. Nice work! Very original.",0
Wouldn't call myself a Young Thug fan but this is fucking brilliant lol,0
Creative,0
This shit is a masterpiece.,0
TERRIBLE,0
"Well, for better or worse, I am not a habitual consumer of rap music but I watched this whole video from start to finish and enjoyed every second of it. So it may not be what you expected but you're probably going to get a lot more views than you would have if the dude had shown up.",0
If your reading this you just realized you've been trolled by GOAT aka Picasso,0

Gee. A Knee-Grow doesn't show up for work. That's a first.,1
"For the curious: the ""ass to ass"" reference is from the movie Requiem for a Dream.",0
"I would have never heard this song or ever watched this video if it wasn't for Reddit. I feel sorry for the directors and producers who work for this idiot. $100,000 could have fed a lot of children.",0
I actually waited for Young thug to show up.  Real catchy music,0
None of this matters,0
"Best music video I've seen, hands down. Props to that man.",0
"Yo Ryan Staake it sucks that Thug ruined a shoot you planned for months and a video that would've looked great on your reel, but shit happens-- rappers don't show up for a shoot, label reps are assholes, and everyone knows that... this comes off as kinda funny but also like i just listed to you whine for 5 minutes about how you got paid a lot of money to direct a video and your art didn't turn out the way you hoped, sorry man",0
did you stop coming to kenya men we waiting,0
"I'm not much a fan of rap due to the banality of it, but this video kept me watching for just the opposite.",1

"This is the most passive aggressive video I've ever seen.  ""What?  Artist can't make it?  Well, my video is awesome anyway.  Tell his agent he can show up whenever.  Or not.  I have to deal with the cops now.  Whatever.""   This is seriously hilarious.  I wonder how many of these get made this way.  100k to mess up a cop car and throw a party.",0

Fantastic satire.,0
Pretty shitty music video. A for creativity though.,0
"Heard stories of Thugga being difficult like this. Did a show w him in SD a few years back, man didn't show up till 1AM and could barely gather himself to rap a song. Oh, and we paid him 10K+ for that.",0
"BTW, That """"Ass to Ass"" reference was from the movie ""Requiem For A Dream (2000)""",0
This is fucking stupid and young thug is a talentless fuckin waste... $100k.. fuckin hell burn the world,0

"I feel sorry for America having to live with some garbage like this young thug and the retards that want to live like and emulate these 1 in a million retards that made it somehow. Refers to women as bitches, have videos smashing up police cars, imagine the riots if I made a vid of a black man been shot by a cop, I'd be BLM'd to death. Kids do well in school, go for those free scholarships and break the cycle from poverty, especially the young black delusioned that are from broken homes, with no good family members constantly moaning how there's no piont trying cos the world is against you blah blah..",0
"Dont listen to whoever this entitled mumbling ""rapper"" is, came here from Reddit only for the video",0

"Thug didn't turn up on time, he didn't co-operate with anyone, or do anything for HIS video because he was so fucking high on Weed Lean and Xanax he couldn't function probably and plus he doesn't eat at all so his body and mind will be all over the place. 
 
He paid $100,000 and wasted everyone's time because he was too stoned off everything, then somehow they put together this video.

could have done the same for my sets, but I was told specifically what

It's fucking awesome!,0
C'EST UN GENIE !,1
"Wow. Ryan, you have talent. Young Thug, you seem like an asshole.",0
The only music video I've ever actually paid attention to. Didn't even like the music.,1

Requiem for a dream,0
"damn i love it man do your shit like you doo maaan, have no shape like mind ma man",0

Young Thug is a talentless mongrel. Is your mother one of those bitches or hoes that you speak so poorly of?,0
10/10,0
"Great video, shit music, retarded childish ""artist"".",0
Yung Thug is a hollywood diva smh... Good video nonetheless.,0
I had to mute the video to enjoy what the guy created as that music is fucking torture and who the fuck is Young thug ? Is he a young thug because it sure sounds like it,0
"What kind of a ""Thug"" doesn't get out of the car of his on music video shoot because his instagram got hacked? What a fuckin' bitch.",0
This is genius.,0
"So I'm an independent rap/trap music video director and editor. Some of the best artists I work with never show up to shoots and eat cheetos on set and all kinds of bullshit. Young Thug is possibly my favorite artist in the game right now because of his creativity, differentness, and don't-give-a-fuckness. This is the best music video I have seen in a very long time. It has a story while sticking to the classic rich, trap video concept. It's self-aware, funny, exciting, and goes hard as fuck. Thanks, Staake, I'll be checking out your other work. And thanks, thugga thugga. I love this.",0
That shit Was dope,0
"The thumbnail had my hyped, I thought we were gonna see mv for wyclef jean but instead we saw a video of a co-director bitching about this unfinished mv.",0
damn bullshit adds,0
"Remove the box thing:

If you have Adblock Plus you can remove that thing. Go to the video, pause the video. On Chrome, click the Adblock Plus icon on the top right corner and click Block Element. Block the elements of the box thing until it's gone, you will need to ""block"" it few times before it's gone completely.",0
great ad at the end of the video covering the text.,0

This is the best music video I've ever seen,1
"this is dope, but i dont know why haha",0
I doubt the thugs that would listen to this shit could even read your subtitles. Why would someone work with a talentless ghetto fucker? Seems blacks will make the worst of their people famous just 'cause they can. Pathetic.,0
"Eventhough the artist is not involve,nice concept for a video...Really Dope",0
"Faut pas croire, mais ces petites bagnoles ça coûte la peau du cul !",0

literally the best music video I've seen in a while,0
Sluts will be sluts because they can't be women.,0
like the video but the music is shiiit,0
at least it was a truthful video. bigs ups to thugger tho he never appeared except that 1 shot.,0
Well this is different,0
Just when I thought modern music couldn't get any worse...,0
Nah actually I won't watch this again so it's not a successful video they never should of put this out. It's like outtakes to the audio,0
another kid who gets to much money for doing nothing fuck this,0
This is fucking hilarious bro😂😂😂,0
delete the video straight up to recycle bin then  press enter and open recycle bin folder then delete it againa and its over no moree thuger virus videos again,0

is young thug retarded? seems like a real jerk..,0
props jebany czarnuchu xdxd,1
his channel has been hacked and thats why they upload this shit,0
This is just amazing. I watched it twice and I don't even really care for the song all that much. Fantastic video.,0
thug q som da hora very nice BR,0
"I don't believe a single word of this. This is all drawn up exactly how they wanted it, and the narrative is just something they constructed in a clever attempt to get more views. The video is pretty funny and will likely go viral, so yeah they succeeded, but like most things on the internet, this video is still fake and gay.",7
Soooo much fun !!!! Reference from Requiem for a dream btw,0
If this was wyclef Jean then o can't wait for the music video of RiRi,0
This is the most Young Thug video ever,0
"This is so young thug, greatest music video of all time. 2017 starting off right. Also been playing Jeffrey on repeat since republican nominee debates",0
There's guys wanted to do something for him he wanted but never showed up? still the song is lit as fck,0
Need more music videos like this in the world.,1
Movie reference is from Requiem for a Dream,0
"i wish i could tell what the ending was trying to say but i cant close the fucking vevo pop up, good job youtube",0
Moral of the story:  Cheetos must be thought of as quickly as possible at any given moment.,0
Young Thug makes music for people who don't understand this video.,0

So Thug didn't want to take his lil' ass off the car just because his insta has been hacked? The money makes people like kids i guess...,0
Idk if thugger approved of this video but if he did this is creative as fuck,0

"Pomp&Clout

"Well done on the popups that cover the end narration, that was genius.",0
The ass to ass reference is from requiem for a dream. Amazing movie fitting for this fire ass song.,1
Seems like a massive twat.,0
"im glad they posted this ""mistake"" on his 100% official youtube channel lmao",0
"""Ass to Ass ""? That would be Requiem for a Dream",0

Reminds me of his concert I went to... dude didn't come out until 2 1/2 hours after his opener did his thing and the Dj ran out of music to play. Oh and this was 4 days after the original date of the concert since it got postponed the first time.,0

fucking class idea!!,0
Giannis Antentokounmpo #NBAVOTE,1
"300 do all this planning with the director Pomp&clout and get it all done and all Young Thug has to do is show up and rap, he arrives late and doesn't bother to attend the clip, 300 are left spending all this money for a video clip and Pomp&clout are left with all this planning that didn't happen, they sat their and put together a genius video with what they had by just telling the story how it happened, 300 knew this will be controversial and also different and most importantly will still gain views and people will enjoy it to some extent

The real question is did young thug approve this video? or is this gonna be the first time he seen it on youtube

That's my personal take",1
The movie is Requiem for a Dream,0
Hahahaha shit too funny😂😂,0

"Thug on a reggae beat? that sounded kinda nice, Hawaii will love this one!",0

"When people react like they have made the new Jodorowsky's Dune but actually it's just an ordinary and consensual project explain. 
That's interesting to see what happened on the shoot but that have nothing to deal with genius or greatness. It's sad and will be better to have the actual clip + the explanation (making of) which will be funny to have. But without the clip it don't worth a lot.
The song still great but don't cry GENIUS too fast",0

"I don't see how this was incredible. It's just a story about Young Thug trying to create this lit ass music video, but then end up not showing up to it because of all the bad shit that was happening. But then why release it if it wasn't finished??? And all they did was put his music in the background..And I'm not hating, but just saying. You can't make a failed video into a masterpiece.",1

"This is unique
But the director should use what he have next time, he had the whole day and he can't make a 5 min music video, even without the Thugalishious he could make a nice music video, like Skrillex's
Instead he complaining that Thug never showed up, label this, label that, bla bla bla, making fun of it, kinda wasted budget if u ask me and it's not looking nice at all, but ye, like i said unique at least",0

"this is fuckin awesome i hope this stays up
hilarious",0
"Well honestly this made for a more interesting video anyways. Its better that people actually got paid instead of ""celebrating excess"" and wasting all that money that could really make people have better lives. I think the mellodramatic story also makes it more interesting and gives some minute details about a small part of a random day in the life of Jeffrey. I think the original video concept that Thug had imagined also would have made for an interesting video but ultimately would probably have been forgettable. This was almost like the documentary of a failed music video shoot but it's definitely the most bizarre of all his music videos so far and he has some great videos. Half Time, With That, Thief in the Night, etc. Either way its a cool story.",3
