I saw a human wearing a paladin armor, he was just sitting on the floor, petting a goat. When I got closer, he looked at me, and said: \"Unown, you are the chosen one for this world.\" Before I could even respond, he and the goat disappeared. Needless to say, I was confused as hell. But it all made sense in my dreams. The Paladin along with the Goat of the New World appeared in front of me, they showed me the Goat. The enlightenment, the joy of playing Battletoads. That dream showed me what true happiness is. All they wanted in return was for me to be the prophet of this world, the one that will spread the word of the Goat to everyone. There is no heaven, there is no hell. There is only the Goat. Ever since that dream, my main duty in my mortal life is to be the Goat's prophet. My friends and family have already accepted the Goat, and soon this town and everywhere else will accept her as well. Just thinking about it makes me cry... but don't worry, I'm not sad. I'm happy."
