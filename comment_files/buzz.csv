"they siphoned billions of dollars away from the public that could have been spent on a lot more urgent needs billy boy, i'm glad buzz ""buzzed"" him ,  the guy was a cunt !",0
Wow you even added Jay Weidner's take on Stanley Kubrick's The Shining movie faked moon landing clues.  Fuckin perfect.,0
I've had enough of your disingenuous assertions.,1
Buzz got fed up.,0
Buzz Aldrin is a World hero. If you are slandering him in these comments you should be ashamed of yourself. When the human race expands out into the stars it will be on men like Buzz Aldrin's shoulders!,0
"nice one, buzz",0
go BUZZ!!!,0
Leave me alone!  will Ten bucks cover it?  lol,0
"i dont like buzz, i dont like the fat guy, and i dont believe we landed on the moon. But damnit i love bill burr :P",0
I don't understand how you can be this smart and this ignorant at the same time but somehow Bill pulls it off...,0
I wish I could have ONLY one Hour with this Asshole Sibrel!,0
Yup those Freemasons can hit hard when you call out their BS! ;),0
"Houston, the Eagle has landed...a right hook",0
So remember to eat your oats children. You may not be able to go to the moon like Buzz ... but you'll still be strong enough to punch an arsehole's lights out when you're in your 80s!,0
when you realize the video time is 420blazeit,0
Fat fucking triple cheesburger eatin face lol!,0
"Nicely put, Bill. ""The KGB couldn't figure out if Americans didn't go to the moon but this tub of shit apparently did.""",0
"Answer to your question at 0:50.  You'll notice that at the height of the Vietnam war, during the presidency of Tricky Dick Nixon, is when all the moon landing missions occurred.  Whenever there was really bad news coming in from Vietnam Tricky Dick sent 3 more astronauts to the moon to distract the American tax payers and keep them patriotic while 300+ young American soldiers were coming home in body bags every week.  Who did it hurt?  Wake up after 48 years, you fucking nimrod.",0
Holy shit just shut the fuck up and show us the video,0
"I am anti-violence, but this is one of my favorite punches of all time.",0
"not only for being a hero but for punching a fatty in the face. oh man! that was good, I lost it.",0

He may not have landed on the moon but his right hand sure as hell landed on that chin.,0

"OO WEE LOOK AT ME, I FAILED SCHOOL AND MY LIFE IS A COMPLETE JOKE. 
BUT IT'S OKAY, BCUZ IM ENLIGHTENED AND SHIEET. 
I'M SPECIAL!!!! 
I'M NOT A SHEEPLE LIKE YOU! 
I SAY THE MOON LANDING AND SCIENCE IS A LIE! 
THE FACT THAT A LOWLIFE PATHETIC MORON LIKE ME SAID THAT COMPLETELY DISCREDITS EVERY SINGLE SCIENTIST AND SCIENCE DISCOVERY THERE IS! 
NO! I DIDN'T FAIL SCHOOL BECAUSE I'M RETARDED, I QUIT SCHOOL CAUSE I'M SPECIAL AND SHIEEEEET. YOU ARE ALL BELOW ME!!!!!!",0

That was a rude way of dealing with the issue but he's probably right. Those guys never went to the moon.,0
"I love how the lady finally just walks away like ya know what fuk it , hit him.",0
Wow!  Ole Buzz tried to send that guy to the moon...but he was to fat...but he SURE did make him see the stars!   Lol.,0
"Buzz never punched this idiot because he denied the moon landing, he smacked him for harrassing him and his family, and for calling him a liar and a coward in public. Buzz should have kicked the living shit out of him.",1
FAT,0
Should have beaten that disrespectful cunt unconscious.,0
I love it! A man with balls that's not afraid to stand up to a asshole! I wish he really beat the shit out of him!!!,0

I feel like that is legally harassment and if not it should be.,0
"I can't take credit for thinking of this comment. Saw it on a different Buzz punch video and it's total gold:

2nd best landing by Buzz.",0
That was the greatest thing I've seen in a LONG time!! Ex boxer here...Great punch!!,0
I come to this video once and a while just to hear bill call this guy a soft serve ice creme eating fag. Fuckin gold.,0
His name is Bart Sibrel !,0

"Classic, hahaha",0
"yeah- it was a FAKED MORON LANDING! gawd it would be so much fun loop replaying that punch in time to ""another one bites the dust"".
wish to fuck this would also happen to all the 9/11 truthers out there, fucking losers all.",0
I don't care about the moon. He's a hero for punching a fatty  in the face. Rock on Buzz Aldrin.,0
Is this guy where Buzz lightyear got his name from?,0
Fuck moon landing deniers,0
we have never landed on the moon or been out of the earth atmosphere.. He is right. They are all freemasons,0
Awesome!,0
"Didn't hit him enough.  Of course, that chubby fuck either sued him or is in the process of doing so.  A lot of guys would have disemboweled him.",0
"I agree with Bill Burr in this video, but why call this guy a fag? Is he referring to that homosexuality is a bad thing?",0
I'll that was a haymaking of a bunch... 😕 💥,0
This video was staged.  Buzz Aldrin never punched this guy.,0
"Buzz, hats off to you for that! He should've been wearing a ring that had ""Eagle 1"" on it backwards, to let that fool know it landed...",0
Happy Birthday Our Hero Buzz thanks for Dance at20th fox 70's Edy Williams hope Cross path again Sorry for that lunatic stalker!,0
"Damn, you can see that loser's skull move before his face.",0
maybe they faked it ...who cares!!  But the balls it takes to sit at the top of that Saturn V...full of fuel !!!,0
none of them would swear on the bible and say they landed on the moon.,0
"""Soft serve ice cream eatin fag""...",0
"Good for him, I'd have done the same thing",0
"This is a VERY distressing video to watch.  And the most distressing part is, Buzz didn't put this stupid son of a bitch in the hospital for a couple of months.",0
"Agree with everything Bill says, except that ""it"" (fake or not) did ""hurt"" a lot of people, because ""it"" was paid with extorted tax money.",0
"Tips on how to punch like Buzz Aldrin:




- Don't blow it
- Keep it simple
- Count your money",0
"Fuck that fat coward piece of shit. Glad Buzz buzzed his ass. Calling that old man a coward, when he himself is a coward for trying to provoke an old ass man!",0

Mean straight right,0
are u related to Sarah Palin?,0
"Buzz and fellow Astronauts have more guts than any of these harassing assholes who probably don't know their ass from their elbows anyway! We're proud of Buzz and all the brave men and women that have the guts to go into space! Buzz, take it easy, you deserve it.",0
lol fat chesse burgar face good punch,0
"RIP Buzz, you were the man",0
Buzz needed to put his body more into that punch.,0
">somehow manages to pass through the van allen radiation belt and survive through freezing temperatures in the lunar space craft without having on-board batteries to support such power expenditures to enable a heating and protective device.
>gets defended by government welfare sell-sword queen with a jewtube account whose best argument is calling the opposition a fatty.",0
I like how u put that shinning conspiracy bit,0
"No judge or jury would ever convict him for slugging this guy. No prosecutor would ever even bring any charges. Even if the guy sued he would never win because Buzz is a national hero and this guy is a idiot who got what he deserved. What I do find disappointing is that someone else there did not get in this guy's face and back him down, or lay him out if necessary,  before it ever got this far.",0
lmao true American hero,0
My favourite punch ever!,0
"The dude was acting like a woman, insulting somebody and not thinking about the physical ramifications that could happen (ass kicking). Don't know why I went all lawyer on ya but eh.",0
"love our channel man,  keep it up :)",0
Usa had every reason to fake a moon landing. Most important was to bankrupt the soviets into space. Im not saying it did happen but its dum to say they had no reason to fake it.,0
"Buzz, you are an American hero! salute for Rockin that pussy.",0
Nice one buzz that Bible bashing inbreeding pice of uninformed dumdass monkey crap got what he deserved if nobody landed on the moon both the Russian and Chinese space agency's would have posted any information regarding a lie to world that the Americans lied in getting to the moon but as they have not means the Americans got there.,0
"I think its pretty sad that some people have such sad pathetic lives that they come up with these conspiracies.
I mean, sure, there are lots of things that hve unanswered questions, but fuck me the moon... Have some people got no shame?
If you get a really really good telescope, especially a digital one that you can control with your PC, you can enter in all kinds of locations and you can see in many cases, some of the crap we have left up there, such as moon buggies and so on.
I have seen these for myself with my fathers own telescope.

Its the same with the ISS.... Anyone with a pair of even good binoculars can see it for fucks sake, and yet there are some stupiud morons who say it doesnt exist! - what sort of stupidity must someone have to be that dumb?",0
"Do you love the way the guy's voice wanes when he says ""thief"", as Buzz's fist crams some justice down his throat?",0
To the Moon Alice,0
that Dick head ate one big knuckle sandwich,0
notice how buzz's daughter spends the video stopping him from decking that bloke but as soon as he is called a coward she turned and walked away and just let him unload. she knew she wasn't stopping shit after that comment.,0
You don't get it?  Use your fucking brain.,0
Moonfist,0
He didn't punch him hard enough in the face. It didn't satisfy me.,0
"Buzz landed that punch...no conspiracy there. Lucky for the guy I wasnt the doorman, i would have
broke up the fight by stepping on the guys face....they had to be separated right?",0
"Imagine the onions on this guy!   To get on to a rocket, with a very good chance of exploding, to go into a hostile enviroment with even a GREATer chance a deadly failure.   Too bad he only popped this pudgy fuck, once!",0
Wish there were a couple more good ole boys there to lobotomize this disrespectful anti American sack of vomit.,0
Buzz Aldrin and his colleagues lost a lot of close friends to accidents in the space program.  I'd imagine that would fuel a lot of rage when asshats rant in his face like this situation.,0
As tweetie bird said...Right on the kisser!,0
"Fuck that pasty pile. People like this piss me off because they always have a better job than me. Like, this freak? Really? Wtvr",0
"The asshole is Bart Sibrel, who ironically has a very good documentary called 'A funny thing happened on the way to the moon' (availble on youtube) which is actually worth watching. Then he did another where he doorstops all the astronauts that went to the moon and does the same thing. He gains access to their homes unfortunately and some it is quite upsetting.",0
"Joe Rogan is another hoax-believer. NASA's 10,000 employees all lied for 50 years? The Soviets kept Shtum all this time? Cmdr. Aldrin was one of the bravest men in history. Travelling for three days to the moon and hoping you get back safely? He probably punched him out in memory of Chaffee, Grissom and White.",0
Great punch,0
How many times can I jerk off to this?!?!?!,0
'soft-serve eating fag',0
what happened to the good ol days where conspiracy theorists stayed at home typin their theories out on the net with their fuckin tin foil hats?,0
That punch was OLD SCHOOL!,0
"this "" soft served ice cream eating fag ""  hahaha brilliant",0
"hell yeah buzz, that guy was a fucking moron...",0
soft-serve ice cream-eatin' fag,0
hahhahaha buzz,0
"you're a liar, a coward, and a thiEEEf",1
"seantendo001, so you don't have any good documentary evidence of a faked moon landing and you are full of shit. Imagine my shock!",0
Nice punch but if you slow it down lol............,0
"It's not good to lie. Buzz didn't have a reason to punch him. Also, a tell-tell sign that he's lying is he refused to put his hand on the Bible.",0
It is unbelievable that there are people out there who think that there is a massive conspiracy to fake the moon landings. They are like flat earthers. Way too much time on their hands.,0
You don't mess with irl buzz lightyear you pussy conspiranoid!,0
Triple-cheeseburger-eaten face was punched...I laughing so hard,0
"like you said Bill even if the moon landing was faked what kind of douche accosts an 80 year old man? One that gets creamed by a real ass man, our gramps once was mugged by some young punk and put the little pussy in the hospital he too asked to be left alone. I loved that old man . Boxed his way through the depression..,,,Boxed his way through the Safeway parking lot at 85!! Thanks Billyboy!!!",0
look at what buzz did when he knew he was gonna hit dude. he reached into his pocket for a fist pack hahaha. that old fucker is hardcore,0
"""for punchin a fatty in the face""",0
"Bart Sibrel, and anyone who does not believe the moon landing happened, are dumb phucks. If your dumb ass was taking to the moon and shown evidence, you'd still come up with how Buzz Aldrin was not on the moon. He should have beat you to a pulp. IDIOT",0
"I  (generally) try not to call names because you can't change someone's mind when you go hard on offense, but this whole thing was worded perfectly. The little d-bag wasn't going to listen to fact, he wanted to be a jerk. I just wish Buzz had gotten a few more licks in. The man is a hero and seeing him punch that loser makes me love him more.",0
"Hey chuckles... I know you are new this stuff... but before this shit bomb called the internet hit where all you noobs twist stories, the true conspiracy theorists from the 90s and earlier made it really CLEAR: The ""fake moon landing"" is NOT about we didn't make it to the moon, it IS about what was televised was not the real moon landing. So... to finalize for you... the conspiracy is NOT about that we never made it to the moon, but that the moon landing that was televised was not the real moon landing. Perpetuating the LIE that this conspiracy is about we never actually made to the moon is a red herring and belittles us true researchers.   Please put in for a course correction, and conduct yourself according from now on.",0
He punched him hard! Well done hehe,0
props buzz indeed.,0
what about the billions they charged tax payers?,0
I want to find the guy and punch him too....  And then tune on him a while with a baseball bat...,0
Why would he punch him?  I thought words would never hurt? Don't adults grow up? If he can go to the moon he can go fuck his wife instead of listening to ice cream eating fatass? right Bill? come oooon lol,0
Buzz is such a badass.  He rules.,0
"...And like that, with the force of a shuttle descent, he brought that man with his pie-in-the-sky notions back down to Earth.",0
I think he knocked the quarter pounder out of him.,0

Who's that milf standing next to him? I'd love to fuck her brains out.,1
"If they didn't land on the moon, it hurts the tax payers. Billions of dollars pocketed.",0
Damn. Buzz still has the right stuff.,1
"well, he bang zoomed that guy straight to the moon. amirite? faggots?",1
"How dare this guy bother and insult one of America's bravest men, a pioneer in space exploration, who accomplished more in his life than this guy or, really, most of us ever will, not to mention disrespecting and harassing an 80 year old man! Shame! He got less than he deserved.",0

"profanity and name calling ALWAYS proves that your point is more valid than another's...doesnt it!?
 lmao every single point you make is retarded...""dont ask an old man to tell the truth or to swear on the bible?"". You're absolutely biased towards Buzz, but ONLY because you believe Bart not to be credible..yes?...but what of the NASA footage of faking shots of the Earth (half way to the moon. in Barts Documentary ""A funny thing happened on the way to the moon) on the Apollo mission? You clearly see what they're doing....but that doesnt fit your ""mocking"" agenda....does it!? Who wants to see that when you can just watch Buzz punch a guy for asking him to....swear on the bible....Awwww!!! you cant ask Buzz to swear he DID go, thats just ignorant, lmao you'd make a good CNN reporter/Anchor...cos they're full of shit too.

Maybe show both sides of the arguement, before you lower yourself to nursery school levels of name calling....only retards will listen, but thats what you want isnt it? retards viewing equals money in your pocket... You dont care about the truth or you would have shown more than Buzz punching Bart!....btw the footage of the punch...IS BART'S OWN FOOTAGE.",1
"The thing about the moon landing conspiracy (which bill nails).. Is its not really a breach of liberty.. Like its kinda just one of those things where you know its a bad thing to do.. But not really.. And on the scale of which they actually did do it.. You gotta just be more impressed than mad.

JFK and 9/11 though.. I can get behind wanting to solve that",0
"Buzz punches so hard that fat tall men see moons flying around their head, he is a fucking true hero.",0

"hey morons, Burr included... we didn't land men on the moon. What's the first thing you'd do if you landed on the moon? point the fucking video camera back at EARTH and say ""hey there's EARTH, our home... HELLO EARTH"" etc. Search all known video footage of the Apollo missions and you'll notice that there isn't one fucking video depicting the Earth in the background with the Fakeonauts in the foreground, NONE. It's fake, we didn't land men on the moon. There's footage of them driving the lunar rover around cracking jokes, them golfing on the moon, playing hopscotch, singing karaoke etc... not one fucking video of the Earth over their shoulder as they scratched their balls on the moon.",0
Buzz Aldrin is an American hero,14

Don't mess with any veteran sir.,0
Wow. Good for you Buzz. Not even sex feels as good as punching someone who deserves it in the face and catching that look they get when you do. That little nano glimmer before the fight or flight kicks in and they realize what just happened. Awesome. If I could put it in a bottle Id be rich...,1

If you truly believe we never landed on the moon then your are the text book definition of a raging moron. That and these flat earth dumbasses with half a brain. My only suggestion to these idiots is stop reading all these wack job conspiracy theory books and quit getting all of your knowledge and information from stupid ass youtube videos. It'll do you wonders in life. I swear sometimes humanity can be so freakin stupid.,13
He practically punched that Mary to infinity and beyond.,0

sure I would give kick him into deepspace...",0
"What if they did lie  and all they actually caught  on  film  was Buzz Aldrin bouncing around on a shitload  of Styrofoam and cotton balls   in the same Hollywood studio  they filmed ""When Mars Attacks""?  Stop asking what and start asking yourself why? I think they faked it for America's own good. To give us hope, to boost our spirit.  We just lost the race to the moon. We were feeling like losers. Russia beat us to the moon and kept throwing it in our faces, and made sure we knew that we where fucking failures.",0
"There's one clear fact that moon conspiracy theorists forget about the moon landing is the signal.  America couldn't receive the signal directly, they needed it relayed from the southern hemisphere.  So in fact Australia had the signal before America did. A signal that in any basic science class shows can't be manipulated without showing evidence of manipulation.",0
Don't we all want to punch that guy?,0
Buzz lightyear handled himself well for 80.,1

"Good man u are Buzz, he deserved it.",0
"soft serve ice cream eating fag. 

what an awesome insult hahaha.",8
So Buzz is 80 years old. Wondering why not use that wisdom and lay your hand on the bible and swear. So the guy bothering him would walk away. Why wont he do that? Not religious or he haven't been?,0
I mean who does that???,0
Buzz Aldrin is a war hero?,0

"Actually the room was called 237 because it only went up to 217 and the owners were afraid that people wouldn't stay in that room (it was actually 217 in the novel I believe), the change was merely coincidental.

Video is 4:20. Coincidence?,0
"Lmao xD you should take your meds pal, because you're just ranting and babbling. Are you trying to be unbiased?...no? Thought not, you're just cutting the vid for your own untruthful agenda....creating a YouTube channel

SUCKER PUNCHED Bart Sibrel because he was embarrassed....a ""god fearing man"" who WON'T swear on the bible!? An We're supposed to believe him..!? I notice you haven't used the footage of these astronauts running away from a bible!! Also in ""A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Moon"", there is NASA FOOTAGE of the astronauts faking shots, supposedly half way to moon and showing earth.... But go ahead and ridicule him for believing hard facts and  evidence, over a lying actornaut that won't swear on the bible....you know like they do in a court of law? (Thus giving credence to his story) Moon rock they ""brought back"" was also fake.",1

I don't think we went to the moon. if you look into it even a little you will find its a hoax. the KGB dose know it was a fake 40 percent of Russian civilians don't believe it.",0

"Also, I have to say I love this how you've taken audio and brought it to life with video clips. It appears so seamless like this was always a documentary that existed. Fantastic work, just sublime. Subscribed!",0
"My take on it all is thus. The Russians had spies all over the US and it seems highly unlikely they would have ignored NASA. So if we assume that they had spies worked into NASA and by spies I mean people who already had the required skills for the job they would be going to and were placed there for decades, not just a quick spy mission. 

With that kind of access, the Russians would have had a field day ruining the US's reputation around the world that they had to fake a moon landing while Russia was successfully sending manned missions to space.

And to think even if they had pulled off the greatest hoax of all time, at some point in the future, maybe a near future, no one knew, the first real mission to the Moon would have shown there was no evidence of them ever being there. Of course with hindsight we know that funding for this kind of thing dried up after the cold war died down and there's never been a moon landing since but back then it was assumed we'd have a base up on the Moon before long.",0

"While it was handy, AGC wasn’t particularly powerful having 64Kbyte of memory and operating at 0.043MHz. In fact, it was less equipped than a modern toaster!

the technology of a modern day toaster was guiding that through deadly radiation and temperatures.....if they went 50 years ago with a toaster, why dont we have a research center up their today?? why haven't we been back?? its a huge friggin deal if they lied to the world about this, it shows they'll lie about anything

http://www.zmescience.com/research/technology/smartphone-power-compared-to-apollo-432/",0
"Why don't they think we went to the moon? Our technology back then was primitive by comparison (today), but it was good enough to get the job done. We were able to do it, because we leveraged our brains doing a lot of math and science to find ways to get what tools we had utilized to get the goal accomplished.

These are probably the same idiots that think precursor civilizations like Egyptians and Mayans needed aliens to help them erect massive pyramids, because they narrow-mindedly think that people in precursor civilizations couldn't have possibly have been smart or had any inkling of engineering or how simple machines work to magnify labor in such ways to move mountains.

Humans are smart. We always have been. There have been exceptionally gifted and bright individuals through-out all ages, and they helped create engineering marvels that others (that are either too stupid to learn complicated concepts, or unwilling to learn them) think aren't possible by humans. Just because one person can't fathom how to do something doesn't mean it's impossible. It means that person can't do it... but others possibly can.",0

"What an absolute fucking ledge. Sir Buzz aldrin, fucking stud.",0
"That was a beautiful punch,old man can throw down",0
You're dope end comment,0
great form on that jab!,0
"I would call what Buzz did self defence.  This was harassment and verbal abuse by that dude.  At several points in the altercation Buzz had stated he wanted to be left alone. When someone gets in your face like that and you repeatedly tell them to back off and they don't, you should have the right to get physical with them. In my mind they are a potential threat to your physical being.  

I had been in a similar incident like that before.  Some stupid drunk dude off his meds wouldn't back off of me and was getting in my face. Kept telling him to back off and he wouldn't.  I even lit up a cigarette and kept backing away, but he kept inching closer yelling in my face with spit flying from his mouth.

When my cigarette was done I grabbed him by his jacket and threw him to the ground.  After that he backed off. Sometimes it's the only way. The bad thing is that I could have really hurt him and have to live with that along with other problems. I'm sure Buzz felt the same way after punching that dude.  People need to learn to back the fuck off when they are told to. If you get in someones face be prepared for the consequences. It never ends well. 

The lesson here kids is don't smoke.",0

"Just before Buzz hit him he was probably thinking, 5,4,3,2,1 POW.",0
Awesome punch,2
should kicked him in the balls as well nice one buzz fuckin legend,0
"Can you imagine, three of Buzz's best friends died in a fire when Apollo 1 was still sitting on the test pad because the capsule was pressurized with 100% oxygen and an electrical spark caused a massive fire?   And this fat piece of lard had the balls to tell Buzz Aldrin he is a ""coward""?   The only thing I'm more sorry about is that Buzz didn't have Bruce Lee  as his security guard.  Buzz, you are the greatest.  This jerk actually sued Buzz for punching him, but the Judge dismissed the case saying that the Jerk ""had it coming to him"".   ""To the Moon Alice"".
        BTW, please consider giving Buzz credit for the first words to have been spoken on the Moon.  Most  believe that Neil Armstrong spoke the first words on the moon, but in reality Buzz did. ( See, Rocketmen, by Craig Nelson).  As the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) was being manually flown by Armstrong, because the on board computer was going to land the ""Eagle"" into a rocky area, Neil Armstrong flew the LEM for more time than was planned.  They landed with only about 17 seconds of fuel left on board.  Armstrong was descending at a rate of a few ft per second, but was travelling sideways about 20 ft. per second.  Everybody was sweating because fuel was low and they had not yet landed.  Finally when the LEM was about 10 feet or so above the moon, one of the three feet long wires hanging from each of the landing strut pads contacted the moon's surface.  They were kind of like the spring ""curb feelers"" on the old large sedans from the 1960s"".  Then, as one of these long  wires ""feelers"" touched the Moon's surface, a blue light went off on the instrument panel.  This meant it was time for Armstrong to hit the button that turned off the landing rocket motor.  As soon as the blue light came on, Buzz Aldrin said ""Contact light"".   Thus the first word spoken on the moon was the word ""Contact"".  Of course we can all argue as to the point when the astronauts were really ""on"" the Moon, but technically, it was when the LEM first touched the moon.  That's why they called the lights on the panel ""contact lights"".   Another tidbit FYI.  The OMEGA SpeedMaster Professional watch was the only watch approved by NASA for space flight, even after they tested it against 5 other contenders like Rolex, and other big names.  The Speedmaster is now known as the ""Moonwatch"".  Neil Armstrong left his hanging on the instrument panel because the LEM's internal clock stopped working.  But Buzz wore his Speedmaster strapped with a very long band of velcro wrapped several times around his wrist on the outside of his space suit.  So, Buzz Aldrin was the first person to wear a watch on the moon, and that watch was the Omega Speedmaster Professional, .321 Movement.  FYI  for anybody who likes moon landing trivia.  The book, ""Rocketmen"" is awesome.  I like the audio book version so I can hear it while driving. FYI",1
Didn't harm anyone????Tell that to OJ Simpson.,0
conspiracy theorists are morons stuck in reverse.,0
I HATE  it when I can't see the reaction to the people in videos like that.,0
"Slay the Hildabeast!  Bernie, (or Jill Stein) or BUST!!!! I would crash and burn with Idiot Thief Trump  rather than sell out to the Hildabeast.....but Bernie and/or Jill Stein are better.",0
That tub of shit deserved it!! LOL,1
"Nice, Buzz!",0
"I give props to Buzz, for punching fatty in the FACE!!",1
i enjoy your commentary. this video is great!,0
That asshole deserved far worse then that .,0
that was a heavy fucking hit lmao,1
"Food for thought..... As to the moron harassing Buzz, he asks him to swear on the Bible. If this moron doesn't believe Mr. Aldrin landed on the Moon, I have no doubt he also doesn't believe in the Bible. Video trash seeking his fifteen minutes of fame....",0
I hope I still got it like that when Im old..... Mucho respect......Thats the way to enjoy those last years!,0
"but the real Punch line of this story is Buzz was charged with Assault (or maybe it was just a civil action) & when they went before the Judge, the Judge threw out the case..... charges dropped,  -0- damages,  -0- liability   whatever.  Buzz Aldrin is 'justified' to smack any nimrod like this.  Sounds good & just to me.   Go Buzz & thanks",0
"Aldrin was actually 72 at the time, but that's still some punch for a 72 year old.",0
Good for you Buzz. Fuck that douchebag! He needs to get laid. I would have not only punched him out but kick him and piss on his fucking face!,0
"wow bill burr is a steaming pile of shit, totally unoriginal, nothing of worth here, just a retard mindlessly blabbering things that the average retard ""relates to""",0
Even the Judge agreed that he deserved the rocket launch punch.,0
aldrin behavior certainly backs up the theory,1
he should stab him the next time and do the world a favor,0
9/11 never happened! You're all fools!,0
Kubrick made him a star.,0
"well neil armstrong would not swear on a bible.. now that was telling..and what is even weirder is the video of the lunar lander blasting off from the moon..it looks like it is being jerked by a cable..and btw, who was left behind to video that ??  last of all, if we went to the moon in 1969, with the rudimentary technology of the times, then why couldn't we go today ??  or in 2 yrs ?? because we don't have the technology..and we sure as hell didn have it then..

so why didn he just swear on a bible that he did ?? that is the question..instead of throwing a punch ?",0
"I swear to God that Bill used to be one of those 'moon landings are a conspiracy' guy? Or am I just crazy..?And Allen your videos are great, keep up the good work and go fuck yourself",4
Buzz threw a nice right hook lol,0
you're a coward and a liar and thwwweeeefffff,0
4:20,0
"If you watch the whole video you would hear the crazy preacher claims space is not real, lmao!",0
NASA now has a six billion dollar budget courtesy of a moon landing that didn't happen that comes out of taxpayer dollars so it hurts everyone that they lie about everything,1
"This guy got exactly what he deserved for harassing an American legend!  Nice job, Buzz!",0
Love this!,0
We never went to the moon,1
"""You're a coward, and a liar, and a HEEF!""",0
"BILL BURR, WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM. AND WHO ARE YOU ANYMORE.",0
"Does anyone know who that piece of shit who was laid out by one of our nations greatest icons is. Buzz you  held your dignity as long as you could. then the, I'm sorry mommy I live in your basement little boy can't give a man his space. WHO DO YOU THINK LANDED ON THE MOON!!! SOME LITTLE SHIT WHO HASN'T CONTRIBUTED to HIS COUNTRY OTHER THAN TAKING A SHIT WHILE CLOGGING UP THE SEWER PIPE?  BECAUSE HIS FAT ASS ATE CHEESE BURGERS AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE TO MANY CHEESE BURGERS. YOU FAT PIECE OF SHIT BUZZ ALDRIN IS AN AMERICAN HERO. HE PROTECTED OUR COUNTRY WHILE YOU, YOU FAT NO WORKING DUMB ASS SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT ON THE TISSUE YOUR FATHER INTENDED YOU TO LAND ON. HOW DARE YOU THINK YOU CAN PUSH THIS HERO AROUND LIKE YOU DID. EXCUSE ME MR. ALDRIN FOR MY LANGUAGE. I KNOW YOU HAVE PASSED AWAY, GOD REST YOUR SOAL. IF THE PIECE OF SHIT WHO WOULDN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE WANTS TO COME OUT AND OWN HIS ATTACK ON YOU I WOULD BE GLAD TO MEET THE PIECE OF SHIT. I KNOW IT'S BEEN MANY YEARS SINCE THE INCIDENT AND I JUST SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. YOU DON'T DO THAT TO AN AMERICAN HERO FROM A GENERATION YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. YOU FAT FN PIECE OF SHIT. RESPOND AND WE'LL CHAT IF YOU HAVE THE BALLS",0
we need to go back to the days when people got punched in the face,0
While I don't believe we went to the moon I would never humiliate a national hero like this guy tried to do to Mr. Aldrin. Nice right hook there Buzz,0
Do you remember where you were when Buzz Aldrin landed one on that that guy's stupid face?,0
Old man strength.,1
This is great! Buzz Aldrin is a bad maw fugger!,0
how old is the original content? cause i thought this shit happened YEARS ago? good video yet again bud,0
"Love ya Bill! We don't agree on everything however, I'm with you 100% on this one!",0
one small punch for man kind .. one giant stand for humanity.,0
Bill Burr's verbal take on things comes out as pure poetry.,2
"I cannot tell you how angry this video makes me. I cannot imagine having such contempt for an elderly man who did more in his life than most of us could dream. 

Major applause for Buzz Aldrin for throwing a nice right 'cross that asshole's jaw. I'd buy Buzz a beer right now if I could.",1
He should have punched him in the adam's apple to put him in an immediate paralysis of pain.  That would larn him...,2
"It really should not be against the law to punch someone who so desperately needs it the way that guy did.  How much verbal abuse and jackass behavior does one have to put up with before you can legitimately dish out a response?  Don't get me wrong, I am not talking about being able to beat someone to a bloody pulp; but what is so wrong with giving a black eye or fat lip to someone who is just begging for it by being a relentless jackass?",0
he probly wont be getting in anyones face anymore,0
"You obviously don't realise that to perpetuate a lie is to control and steal from society.
The Fake moon landing is an archetypical example of the control mechanism that the elite 1% have upon humanity. 
Therefore to answer your question, once you accept non truths as factual reality a great deal of your existence is equated to that falsehood and thus depriving you of true experience of existence; a good place to start would be George Orwell's 1984.",0
"That happened in 2002 when Aldrin was 72, not in his 80s as Burr claims.",0
"Thanks for pointing this out, Bill.

For showing the actual clip.

...dude got rocked.",0
I remember watching the landing in the 7th grade: the whole world watched.,0
Totally rational to attack someone over words.  So big strong man,0
your Beautiful Buzz GET'EM YAAAAAAAAAAAA,0
"No matter how many times I watch it, that ""you're a coward, and a liar, and a mdfghi7ghtsdygfyrb"" sequence never gets old.",0
at a boy Buzz!!!,0
I love that the guy sued Buzz and lost,0
Old fashioned bad ass.  Question a mans honor you deserved to get hit.,0
There were such things as telescopes even in 1969. Does anyone really think the space vehicles were not tracked by multiple sources coming and going? http://pages.astronomy.ua.edu/keel/space/apollo.html,0
"Hey guys. The idea was that we forced the Russians to destroy their economy by having them believe that we were going to spend our money on space exploration. They jumped at the opportunity to be the first, and were happy to spend vast amounts of their own money. Buzz isn't to blame, he was just an actor. No big deal.",0
Moon rocks in that fist.,0
fat fucking triple cheeseburger eating face LMFAO 3:10,15
You're a coward and a liar and a thiEEEFHJHFJG,0
BAM! Right in the kisser! BAM! Riding the kissah! BAM! Writing the kiss uh! BAM! Writhing the kissah!,0
"Ahhh.  Perfect.  Favorite comedian raises favorite internet moment to new heights.  (and for MANY reasons, Buzz Aldrin is a national treasure - I hope I age with even half the energy and spirit of this man)",0
"Agreed. The Russians would have loved nothing more than to prove we didn't land on the moon. They were ahead of the U.S for a long time regarding space travel and exploration. They were very prideful about their space accomplishments, the Russians would have found out and told the world if NASA didn't actually send a person to the moon. 
    The Russians would have to be in on it too, and I don't see that one happening during that time period.",0
i fuckin luv buzz,0
81 years old still a hero haha.,0
"""SWEAR ON THE BIBLE""..??????????... THAT WOULD BE EVEN A BIGGER LIE...!!!!",0
That was the most satisfying punch I've ever seen!,0
is that the same guy from Youtube Video of the Week?,0
They sure did land on the moon. Carl Sagan helped them do it and his integrity was unquestionable,0
this is the best narration in a video iv ever heard,0
Imagine if this POS was around 30 years ago and tried that on a 50 year old Buzz :),0
"Moon landing deniers are hilarious, sad and incomprehensible all at the same time.

The landing was a pretty awesome feat, but it wasn't like performing a miracle.  It took a lot of work and careful preparation, but at the end of the day, going to the moon is just not that hard a thing to do.  We had the technology.

By the way, old badasses like Buzz Aldrin don't need to be coddled -- his age wasn't the reason to leave him alone.  It's more like, 1) have some respect and 2) don't fuck with a man who can still beat the shit out of 95% of the population.",2
"""believes in the bible but not the moon landing""....hilarious!
good for you old man buzz, teach that waste of skin some respect!",0
buzz didn't land on the moon but he sure did make that guy see stars,0
this comes from a documentary about flat earth? why dont they say that,0
i love bill burr,0
"I really wanted to see what happened after the punch (people's reactions, what was said, etc.) Almost cool video but you talk too much, replayed the punch so many times like a dork and didn't let us see the end. Good job",0
"No one has ever walked on the moon.

Get over it.",0
"The Eagle has Landed, motherfucker.",0
"Wow! You're pretty good at calling people names while denouncing the name calling someone else is doing. 😂😂Typical liberal, do as I say not as I do. Lmao you guys are nothing more than a bunch of one liners wrapped up in an ignorant stuper of idiocracy . Your party is burning my friend and the whole world is laughing! 😂😂😂",0
Yeah!! Go back to California!,0
It should become a national holiday. Punch a Fatty in the Face Day.,0
"""Props to Buzz Aldrin, for not only being a hero, but punching a fatty in the face.""",0
Fat fuckin tripple cheese burger eating face!,0
I didn't know Buzz could be any more a hero to me! I just wish you would have kicked him in the balls so hard that they would have returned from the moon baring witness the Buzz's footprints.,0
You have a great way with words dude. haha.,0
"Not a fan of when things end up becoming violent, but this is honestly one of those times when it was truly the last and best option. Well deserved punch in the face.",0
Cunts will cunt,0
Fuck that fat fuck. Nice work Buzz.... :),0
"Way to call it Bill.  You got it dead on.  Heck, just to strap a Saturn  V to your ass and light that candle takes bigger balls than anything else on earth.  That's about 800,000 horsepower.  Yeah...hang on!  Aldrin's punch was awesome.  That fat douche should be required to show everyone he meets that vid, so you know what kind of an idiot you're dealing with.",0
"I used to think this was the stupidest conspiracy theory ever. Then I became aware of ""flat earthers"".",0
"who gives a fuck if he went to the moon, there's proof he socked this cunt in the face and thats a far bigger achievement.",16
"That wasn't a right hook bill.
That was a straight right hand.
And not bad for an old stick.",0
"""I don't even know how he puts on his flight suit, the size of this guy's balls."" LMFAO",0
why have we never gone back?,1
"Lesson:  faked or not faked, don't fuck with the old guys",0
"The moon is fake, but Uranus is far too real.",0
"The only thing I don't like about this video is that Buzz DIDN'T HIT HIM HARD ENOUGH!!! Then, Buzz should have kicked him where his balls are SUPPOSED to be!! Slap the shit outta this dick head Buzz and send him home to his mommy!!!",0
Kudos to Buzz Aldrin,0
Pit bull mode...Bill Burr finally admits that pit bulls are predisposed to be a violent breed of dog. Love it!,0
the guy deserved it...good for Buzz..,0
I'd say Buzz was doing him a favor. He needed some sense knocked into him.,0
Awesome,0
Dr Buzz knocked the fuck outta that fat fuck,0
"Who cares if we didn't land on the moon. Do you have any idea of the technology that came from NASA?? I mean come on. Just the technology alone is worth it. Now there is a story of the CIA pitching an idea to Stanley Kubrick about faking it IF they couldn't do it, but who cares??",0
Good commentary dude!!! Shit was fucking great. Just to let people know there are Satalite pictures of the moon landing. Taken by a Japanese probe,1
"Bill burr is one funny cunt had me laughing through the hole thing ""that punch would have dropped me"" hahaha",0
The Russians always knew we didn't go to the moon. research the subject.,0
"Bill's comments here are spot on. This, for me, is the strongest argument against these conspiracy theories . The Apollo Missions were in the middle of the cold war and the Soviets were watching everything like hawks and no doubt had spies in NASA, just like they had spies in the Manhattan project to build the bomb in WWII.
If the moon landings had been fake the Soviets would have known and it would have been all over Pravda.
The funny thing about this jackass who was harassing Buzz Aldrin, is that he tried to sue Buzz for assault and the judge essentially told him to fuck off. That's the icing on the cake.",0
Nice one Buzz.,0
"Every moon-hoaxer deserves this fate....maybe we should honor Buzz and punch the nearest fat fuck, lunar-conspiracy moron so hard that his tin foil hat lands in his vegetarian chili.",1
this is probably one of the mot satisfying videos on YT...,0
should have stamped all over his head,0
All I read on more than half of these comments are people dick-riding.,0
What was that video about the shining at the end,0
"Conspiracy theorists generally have an inferiority complex. It's about being more intelligent than the other ""sheeple"". If they weren't dumb I guess they weren't conspiracy theorists to begin with.

You can look up just about any significant or major news event, and you'll find a moron who is trying to be smarter than others. Holocaust didn't happen, Titanic didn't sink, Elvis isn't dead, terrorist event X didn't happen...",0
"""What did it hurt"" How about the fact that they have taken BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. You really dont know shit do you Bill. You cant travel through the Van Allen Radiation Belts. Its impossible and that proves nobody landed on the moon.",0
he should be punched,0
"Like a boss,  nice one Buzz",0
wonderful stuff,0
What a fukin shot!!!!!,0
"umm what?
how did you come the conclusion of what the kgb had knowledge of?",0
Ha...your a coward a liar and a thuuuuuuuf!,0
win,0
Who is Bill Burr?,0
"Buzz Aldrin does his impression of Eddie Deezen like a bawse, motherf*cker!",0
That's the greatest fucking thing I've ever seen on YouTube.,0
"""You're a coward and a liar and a theifppppft""",0
103 people got their ass kicked by Buzz Aldrin.,3
what film is the odd space craft landing on the platform from?,0
F*cking respect Buzz!,0
The russians stole nuclear weapons designs from the americans through spying and shit. They would totally know if the americans didnt actually go to the moon.,1
Fuck that fat fuck I'm glad he punched that fattie,0
pot calling the kettle black? did buzz say someone didnt walk on the moon? retard,2
nice punch!,1
"One of these days, Alice...",1
A well deserved punch.,1
"""The KGB couldnt figure it out, but this tub of shit figured it all out.""",59
"haha never saw this before, made my day.",2
bill burr is one of those wannabe alpha tough guys. Pretty soon you'll see him in the news being taken for what he's worth from his gold digging wife.,0
He proved he went to the moon by sending HIM to the moon.,0
"No wonder they made that commercial with Buzz punching an alien
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzCUhF5SHw4",0
"So the idea is that space is not what we've been told it is. That's why they want to pretend we've already been to the moon (even though a while ago some guy from NASA said they haven't figured out how to get through the Van Allen belts yet, which would make going to the moon impossible). There could be many reasons for this. Some Flat Earthers believe that we're in an enclosed dome and the stars are fixed below it; the Creator then resides somewhere outside of it. Some believe they faked the moon trip to perpetuate the idea that space is vast and we're a tiny blue dot and ultimately inconsequential. It would also help the alien agenda when that finally comes (when we're visited finally by what we're told are extraterrestrials, but they'll actually be interdimensional fallen angels and demons, and not extraterrestrial at all). If the model of space is false, there would be major ramifications regarding many agendas. The Evolution theory would obviously be out the window as well as Big Bang and once again the idea that we're somewhere at the end of a 14 billion year timeline and just another tiny planet in a massive universe; well, that would all be debunked. There's a lot to speculate on, in terms of space, or the moon landing, being a conspiracy. What's important to know is that Christ is the truth, and mainstream science really has lied to us about many things (like Evolution and the claim that Evolution is science. It isn't at all. It's a mere belief that gets sold to us as fact. Which is insane. Way to go ""science."" Way to go NASA. Please keep taking our tax dollars).",0
If Buzz Aldrin didn't land on the moon he really didn't punch him out either I guess,3
"Ha Ha, listen to Lucid Rivers.",0
"All the good little brain washed sheep came out to thank and praise an old man who they don't know, never met, and can't even trust. If we didn't go to the moon, then he is a fraud, and guess what, the video footage from the moon landing is as fake as a 3 dollar bill, NASA lies constantly. Why is he a hero?",1
Pure Gold!,0
"the war hero is an agent, i could give a fuck about elderly age, they didnt go to the moon",1
2:25 SWEAR ON THE BIBLE? OK BUT IT MEANS FUCK ALL.,2
LOL,0
space doesnt exist,0
Triple-Cheeze-Burger Chin! LOL,1
he's seeing stars now...,1
I never saw this. It's awesome.,0
"he landed on his jaw, for sure.",1
"buzz can piss offhe endorsed the airwalker ,cheap piece shit , they broke cost people heaps sell out prick",0
They're both full of shit.,0
Who the fuck does this guy think he is to tell one of the very few men that have accomplished the once unthinkable...actually walking on the moon..... that he's a liar?  Really?  I would have curb stomped this paranoid nutsack.,1
buzz could still kick most of our asses.,0
soft serve ice cream eating fag...best insult in history...,0
i hate fat people,0
that being said he shouldn't be drilling an old man for information about it,0
moon landings seem staged as fuck,0
"Fuck Buzz. He lied for the establishment to keep us enslaved. But, I would have hit him too.",0
haha. beautiful,0
"Flat foot American hero w/ a nutsack dragging the fucking floor, do it Buzz.",0
"chaosawaits so they had fairly accurate measurements in the late 1950s but Kubrick picks up a book from 1878 to look for the distance to the moon in the 80s...

Correct me if I'm wrong but nothing else in the film has anything to do with Apollo 11. This scene is overblown by conspiracy theorists. 

+chaosawaits",0
We love you Buzz!!,0
I met Buzz when I was a kid!!,0
"Bart Sibrel is the name of the guy who got punched in the face, He himself is a liar he lured Buzz into the hotel under the pretext of a interview by a japeneze TV station. Sibrel turns out is the liar as he is NOT a reporter infact he is a taxi driver who was later charged with vandalism and placed on probation.",0
"the guy called Buzz a coward and liar and he got punched in the face,,,but its so wrong to harrass Buzz there were sound boom guys and camera man there,,,they should of put the gear down and told the reporter that this is wrong,,to disrespect Buzz and to harrass",0
Nice shot man !,0
"cunts like tubby there just need a shot gun to the face. Too many dumb cunts on this planet,we need a thing to thin out the numbers.",0

"what'd it hurt? are you fuckin retarded? some statements are literally too stupid to refute. I mean you could technically do it, but it would do no good. it would be like explaining to a dog why he shouldnt shit on the carpet. they'll never understand you. the best you can hope for is to manipulate them into going outside through positive/negative reinforcement. so, instead of explaining why that was a dumb comment, I'm just going to have to rub your snout in it. come here.....you hear that comment? NO!... NO! you don't say stupid things and post them online. you keep them to yourself. if you can't hold it, you scratch at the screen door to be let out and go say it under the porch. you go outside and do your retarded business. you don't share it with the world. go on now git.",0
Good point. The KGB would have figured it out and held the fire to our collective asses over it.,0
"where are your peer reviewed papers that theorize the moon landing was a hoax? what scientific community has reviewed such data and accepted the hypothesis? 

oh wait, no one???? because all scientist across the globe are also in it? oh so is a conspiracy within a conspiracy right? 

you cant argue with these people, they dont understand how logic works or how the burden of proof is on the person making the claim.",0
Why not just show the video with audio rather than stupid pointless commentary,0
"Buzz is now and always has been a great man worthy of the public's respect and adoration. Even at his current age, he had no problem proving it one more time.",1
"Back in the day, nobody had to put up with that kind of bullshit, someone had to go!!!",0

"He gave that fatso every change to leave him alone. Warned him several times. 

It's so satisfying to see this fat sack of shit get taught respect with a right hook.",0
Buzz is a BadAss!,0
"LOL!!  Your commentary was as good as the punch. Bravo For Buzz, this guy was just begging for it.",0
So he basically punched the moon. so it's better.,0
"Buzz can handle himself. Had I been there, it would have been my honor to pound that fat fucker to the appearance of bloody guava jelly.",0
"Buzz did not assault the guy. As a former astronaut he was giving a lesson in physics, by demonstrating how Newtonian mechanics works, when using his fist on a Fat Asshole.",272
"anyone see the 2nd punch? no one did, that's how fast buzz is...he hit'm with the ""lightyear"" uppercut!!!
i laughed so hard my pitbull growled at me.",0
What happened after the punch ?,0
One of these days bang zoom to moon,0
LOL.....love seeing pieces of shit like that get put in their place. the nerve of that bitch made punk to roll up on Aldrin like that....wish he would have knocked him dead on his ass then started curb stomping his head.,0
the buzz!,0
"that's an old video. ...I've seen it before, all you added was your voice over.",0

lol!,0
"Someone should have done this for him times 100!
Even that woman should have kicked the moon landing denier fucker in his cunt!
If you see this moon landing denier on the street, what would you like to do to him?",2
It's my belief that the amount of assholes we have in this world is directly proportional to the lack of consequences.  The only reason tubby got in Buzz's face is because he's never had to deal with the consequence of being an asshole.,28
Buzz shows us the correct way to handle obnoxious conspiracy theorists.,26
One more reason that Buzz is a hero and an American treasure.,0
I love Bill Burr.       I think he is great.        But the moon walks were all faked.,0
"I read an article about these conspiracy nut-jobs in the NY Times Magazine years ago, and this guy was interviewed for it. Apparently, he sued Buzz after he got clocked in the jaw ... and the judge threw the case out! Hell yeah!  Also, he was married and he left him over his obsession with the moon landing conspiracy. Sad, sad human being. He still deserved to get a fiver in his fat face from Buzz.",8
"Bill, we can see the evidence of the landing from the Earth with modern telescopes. Do really think if that didn't exist the Russians wouldn't have called is on it years ago?",0
Onya Buzz.  You're still a hero.,7
Pit bulls shouldn't be banned but their owners should be euthanized,0
Stanley never made a fake film on the moon landing. They even have a phony Stanley Kubrick impersonator on film saying he did. When it was proven fake you simple minded still didn't believe we did. The government has a hard time keeping huge secrets and you think Hollywood could. Fucking moronic bastard fucktards.,1
that's one small punch for man. One Knock out for Mankind🙌,297
😅😅😅 This is GREAT!!! You seriously just made my month!!!,0
american hero,0
damn i mean you gotta have a goal and a game plan. did he really think he would achieve anything by chasing around an 85 yr old man? youre no david frost,0
Buzz never landed the punch on the moon face. They're all in on it. It's publicity to scare his Russian publisher into paying the advance on his new book!,0
His daughter knew shit was about to get real and walks off haha.,0
"How are moon landing conspiracies even still a thing? I mean, if you look through a powerful enough telescope you can see the fucking Lunar Lander from Earth!",1
Buzz was a veteran? Had no idea.,0
The price is wrong b*tch!,0
Only you can prevent vaginal itch,1
"Go check out Flat Earth proof.  Earth is a flat disc not a round sphere.  We never went to the moon.  Moon isn't even firm rock. It's a translucent and self illuminating.

dont ever think just because he's old hes not dangerous. this man flew 66 combat missions and was an aerial gunnery instructor.,0
"This video is to long, Buzz should have twatted that prick ages ago.......",0
Buzz Aldrin. A True fuckin American . Hero.,0
boss,0
"I'm glad that Buzz smashed this fat twat in the face.  It's too bad that he didn't have brass knuckles when he did it.  Buzz has accomplished more this week than this douche bag, cunt has in his worthless life.  Also, who wears jeans, a sport coat and high top sneakers and expects to be taken seriously?",0
yup moon landing was a hoax...the earth is flat Bill,0
"""soft serve eating fag"" oh my fucking God so simple but got me good",0
"Bill, you need to stop using ""fag"" as a derogatory slur.",0
way to go buz! if I was there I woulda beat the fuck out of that Fathead faggot. number one he is verbally assaulting a senior citizen that's a crime right there. I would have stepped in and beat the fuck out of him and not spend the night in jail I hate conspiracy mother fucking faggot boys like this one,0
"""fucking soft serve ice cream-eating fag"" has to be one of the greatest insults I've ever heard.",0
"hahahahaha all I can think of is "" the price is wrong bitch""!!!",103
Sweet!,0
"We landed on the moon,i'm so tired of these losers saying otherwise,Yes,I said it,We landed on the damn moon,like you said,if anyone would know it would be the russians.",4
nice amount of snap in that right hand...you could see yer mans head snap back abit...RESPECT BUZZ :),0
I love how the word thief is punched out of his mouth.,0
Nice punch. That loud mouthed arsehole is so brave shouting at an old man. Fucking conspiracy wanker. Idiots.,6
if u can convince a nation of a moon Landing than u can convince them of anything. it was the first trail of many errors,0
"Hope he broke his effin' nose ! He landed on the moon, and landed a hell of a right hook !!!",0
"Buzz is no hero, he is a liar and a coward and he deserved to be called out for his part in the BS moon landing. He is part of the same crowd that lies about all of American history to make chumps out of all of us. Bill if you wanna be a chump and believe we went to the moon in 19 freaking 69 before the pocket calculator was invented  or unleaded gasoline, you go right ahead like all of the other mind control sheep in this country, you get plenty of stupid support. You are the stupid fat fuck this time Bill.",0
"If the moon has 1/6th the gravity of earth why we're the astronauts only jumping the same height as on earth, just slightly slower.",1
"Soft serve ice cream eating fag,ha ha,classic! !",0
"That fat fuck is just paranoid because his wife fakes organisms and now he thinks everything is a conspiracy. One small punch for dickheads, one giant swat for assholes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
dammit I like soft serve ice cream,0
"One of my all time favorite and most-deserved face punches, made even better with commentary from one of the best comedians ever.",0
"hahaha , punch him again then kick A HOLE",0
AND IT IS ALLLLL OVER!!! BUZZ ALDRIN IS THE NEW UFC HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD!,0
buzz aldrin never walked on the moon and if he hit me i would knock his old ass out then i would piss on him while he was knocked out and then i would draw dicks all over his face.,0
"That was fucking phenomenal, I absolutely love Bill's description of that dude.",1
Allenpalin you da f***in man for making these videos. Thank you!,1
bill burr is a cunt shill,0
Who does it hurt? It hurts science.,1
"Bill misses a lot on this. Google, Dave McGowan's series Wagging The Moon Doggie.",0
"First time I've watched it in ages.... I had forgotten how good the punch was. Buzz fucken ROCKED the conspiracy dude. Check how violently his head snaps back, and how he needs to take a large step to balance himself.

IMO the slow-mo replays don't really show the full awesomeness, ya gotta watch the live action starting @3:05. Little does conspiracy dude know that it will be his final 9-word rant before Buzz gives him some chin music.

Buzz could have planted his feet a bit better, but his upper body technique was pretty fucken solid for an old boy. He got his hips and his torso twistin' with the punch to give it more oomph, and he punched thru his target, as evidenced by the impressive follow thru after it connected.",0
so what is the point of your drivel?,2
"LOL This guy absolutely should have gotten bitch slapped for being a BITCH!
BUT--------  if you actually believe we landed on the moon then you've obviously never seriously  researched the topic. And if you've never researched the topic, you should really stay Silent until you've educated yourself!!!! And one more fact for ya-------Education and intelligence are not the same thing. You can be educated into ignorance. If your taught and told lies. Being educated is how well you can ""REGURGITATE "" what an institution has taught you. And if they've taught you false info or lies then you have been educated into ignorance!   GET IT? ""Educated idiots""",0
"I love how Bill Burr is twenty years behind the curve, bill this video came out on VHS",0
"the crowd parted like the red sea at the perfect time, even god wanted that on film",0
A real man plowing a phony in the face. Eat that...,0
thats what I call a moon shot,81
That guy is a total cock.,0
Good!! Go buzz!! Jerez that old buzzard has a a great punch!! That old hero is obviously in better shape than guys half his age. I think he waited too long to punch that fat pukes lights out.,0
To infinity...and beyond!,0
"Russian N1 disaster was kept hush-hush until the fall of the Berlin wall... The failed N1 was the Russian attempt at a moon-shot, when the west beat them, the Russians poisoned the well, using the west's own population to breed doubt and discord and in the wake of Nixon and water-gate the rot within the mind of the many started to spread easily and I see it's still going, Imagine it's the cold war, psychological warfare was at play back then, besmirch the great efforts of the west, bing bang bosh... it's aliens on the moon...",0
Way off on this one Bill,0
"Haha, that was fantastic! Thanks for the upload!",0
Justice served if ever I've seen it,0
For punching a fatty in the face! LOL :D,0
"Buzz represents an era when disrespecting core values deserved a punch in the kisser, and everyone agreed. 
We need that era back.",0
"Here's the Wiki page for the conspiracy guy. It's a doozie...
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Sibrel",1
"Ok all true, the guy's a quarterpounder douchebag Bill, but instead of Buzz letting this guy harass him for months(because that wasn't the first time), why didn't Buzz just calmly, courageously look the douchebag in the eye, put his left hand on the Bible and say ""yes indeed, I swear as God as my witness that I walked on the moon."" period done.  Instead about six Apollo astronauts ran away from this guy, while they could've just calmly sworn on the Bible.  He did get one guy to swear on the Bible and that Astronaut said he didn't believe in God, but he'd be happy to swear on the Bible.  The bottom line is, yeah between the moonwalk and star wars fantasy projects, the Soviets bought into both of them and in the end our Space and Arms race bankrupted them.  Thank God for Ronald Reagan and Hollywood.  Hell I know a lot of things are true simply because I saw them in a movie and on TV....right?",0
Now we await the conspiracy that this video is staged and he didn't really hit him.,0
what I never got was how they fitted the moon buggy in the space ship but after watching this I sure as shit not asking,0
"saw the skull kid and his friends on the moon...saw ol' glory, too...",0
"I don't know about conspiracy theories.  But, we are forced to take things at face value.  For instance, there is a statue in Washington, DC of a guy named Abe Lincoln who served as President.  Was there actually ever a guy named Abe Lincoln, or is there just a statue and a repeated history that Abe Lincoln once lived?  It wouldn't be worth the energy to prove or disprove.  But, the fact that 99% of the population believes that an event occurred or person lived, is not in itself proof of the event having occurred.  People confuse this belief with everybody ""being in on a conspiracy"".  And those are 2 separate concepts.",0
The best time to punch someone in the jaw on when their being a prick and calling you a coward because that way their jaw is open and easier to break and knock them out.,0
Big boy must have been raised on another planet himself if he didn't think an old codger like that would belt him one.,0
"NASA is trying to figure out how to get through the Van Allen belt for manned mission to Mars. (youtube video of NASA tech discussing this huge problem)

why don't they use the same protection used in 1969 to go to the Moon?
because they never went.
what does that matter? nothing.. trillions of dollars unaccounted for. why should that matter?",0
"Yes right, the KGB couldn't find it out that the moon landing was fake (maybe the dumbest thing ever said by bill Blur). bill Blur sucks, the actual hero is the truth seeker and not the lying piece of shit.",0
buzzy's a fraud,0
He deserved 20 punches to the mouth for the way he was behaving.,0
Fatty should get puNched every day for the rest of his life.,0
"Ha, that is awesome. All you idiots who insist on belittling the accomplishments of true heroes who actually landed on the moon, as you sit in your mom's basement eating potato chips and doing nothing, try spewing your bullshit to peoples faces.                                      As 50 year old Gordie Howe once told a young hockey player he had just laid out on the ice, ""Don't respect me because I'm old. Respect me because I can still kick your ass.""",0
Bill called him a fag I don't go for that..,0
You tube peekay truth....buzz aldrin is a liar,0

Great job Buzz !!!!,0

i thought the tittle said  Buzz Aldrin Punches Gay lol,0
Hahahaha that was a good dig. Hope it hurt.,0
I wish Buzz had a baseball bat to beat the shit out of Pugsley,0
Why would anyone swear on a bible if a crazy person came up to you?,0
Men of that generation were no joke.,6
Way to go Buzz!,0
"fake. notice how there is no one obstructing the view of the camera until right before he punches the guy, thats when several people walk right in front of the camera. its a clear shot right before the action.",2
"Bill Burr calls the guy quarter pounder with cheese, but I think we should start calling him quarter pounded. I'm guessing that 1/4# never learned a lesson from all of this and still gasps-runs after surviving astronauts to this day.",0
By your commentary is seems like you have a lot of issues. Sounds like you were the last kid picked.,0
"I'd like to see punching ignorant fat fucks become a national sport. Nice job, Buzz.",12
"Huston, the Fist had landed.",0
My big butcher block head xD,2

that woman was hilarious. ..when he called buzz a coward.  she strolled away.  with that look of well your on your own ...best of luck ..,0
The guy narrating this is hilarious,0
"The earth is flat, we did not go to the moon. By now this should be common knowledge. Bill Burr knows this and has to promote globe earth.",0
Buzz Aldrin too fucking cool! Thanks Bill.,0
"Bill...CIA   KGB   MI6   FBI   STASI  Scotland Yard   Interpol  all of these agencies are all owned  by globalist bankers...They own the governments that pay them....Get it ?  The Trillionaire Bankers  who own everything  and have for 250 years...They have central banks in every country on the planet but 3 or 4...Iceland...Cuba...N.Korea  and  Iran...There were 7  but  they invaded Afghanistan,  Iraq  and Libya  from their 911 event  to put a central bank in each....They control their economies so they can rape and plunder their resources ...They own the politicians ...Nothing is ever a coincidence ...It is always conspired  by  Evil...It is all a rich  mans  trick  to get more  for  them   and  less  for everyone  else...",1
I suppose he thinks the Earth is flat too.,0
oh my God everything he's talking about is f**** retarded the Russians that sitting out the people that's all the b***** that they f**** made up and he sitting there regurgitating it like the actual f**** story this is what angers me the most is a bill or whatever f*** his name is probably knows exactly what's going on but he's paid off so he sitting there pretending like he's a f**** idiot like he's using common logic sense and that all these things are actually just f**** retarded and it angers me so much Bill you are going to hell for this one,0
This narrator is the dummest person ive ever heard.,0
definitely a tub of shit!,0
"Buzz rotated his hips and came off that right rear foot, no doubt that guys jaw clacked hard and maybe broke a few teeth. Buzz is definitely an 81 year old Badass. I too would like to know the truth about the moon landing.",0
Bill are you f**** serious I'm not trying to be rude but pull your head out of the ass man. you talk all this s*** like you f**** know everything but you don't know what's going on behind the moon landing? I'm going to explain something to you right now it doesn't matter if it's real or fake it matters that it's affecting people's life and people like you who don't understand what's going on are the f**** problem. educate yourself better yet ill help educate you right now. the bible says the Earth is f**** flat and through prophecy things can be proven true thus proving the Bible true. now what's going on with the moon landing is if people are claiming they went to space and they went on the moon they can make the claim that we're in space and not on a flat plane that's the whole catch right there that's it that's all it is is to make the claim that the Bible is false by saying we're on a globe in space not on a flat plane. no I highly doubt someone like me who couldn't pass Grade 9 is smarter than you. no that's not the case so the reason is that you're purposely being ignorant or you're actually ignorant. I doubt somebody like you is actually that dumb or maybe you're just actually asking questions. but for me it already angers me that you actually made this video go educate yourself instead of trying to round up the people who don't know any better to get on your side. simply because of your status people are more likely to blindly follow you without any reasoning same goes for a f**** retard who puts on a lab coat says I'm a doctor take this pill. I definitely rambled and granted a lot here a lot of the probably doesn't make sense but for the most part I hope it does,0
Buzz did not like hearing the truth about his life of lies,0
Yay buzz,0
"Good for Buzz, that fat tub of sh*t insulting  Buzz  deserved a good beating.",0
Bill Burr is the kind of degenerate loser.. that Bill Burr would happily tear into.,0
Bill if you think that 1969 technology got humans to the moon ...AND BACK...especially from this murdering...thieving...lying  creature we call government and their media...I'd be surprised because you don't appear to be brainwashed or indoctrinated or programmed for stupid...,1
Buzz served him up a little sweet chin music,1
Hats off to an 81 year old still slugging it out. He wasn't a test pilot in the days of just breaking the  sound barrier and ejector chairs by coincidence.The conspiracy theorist is not only the ultimate coward for antagonising an 81 year old but also of average IQ. The soviet union  would of tracked the flight to the moon and would of been the first to claim that it was a Hollywood stunt but never did. That in its self says enough.,1
"Captain Aldrin has some of the biggest balls on the planet. That's been demonstrated long ago. Although I loved it when he punched that bibble-waving moron, I would much prefer we prevent the science-deniers from ever having children and passing on their ridiculous beliefs.",0
Right hook.,0
that creepo should be arrested.  It a shame Aldrin didn't have a gun on him.,0
How come no one's pointing out the fact that this dude is making money through YouTube ads off a podcast that's been released for free?,0
"if buzz was ten years younger he would've totally kicked this creampuffs ass and drug him through the street. he was a badass back then and still one, even in his eighties. would this coward that was insulting him even have the guts to sit on top of a rocket that could blow up and kill you, go through the launch into space and land on the moon?! he would shit his pants at the thought of it. good for buzz for drilling this loser, he said leave me alone and still kept it up, thinking he could pick on an old man. he thought wrong.",0
Go to 5:11 in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPhCYkaTvS0,0
call a man a coward be prepared to fight.,0
He gave that aggravating bastard every chance in the world to walk away.  Got what he deserved says me.,95
Everybody knows Buzz and Woody went to the moon in that space rocket driven by a horse...,0
dont mess with buzz!,0
Hahaha great great great. I love it.,0
"If the gov concocted a conspiracy, what was the rationale behind Apollo 13? Wouldn't all the missions have been successful?
Hell, we'll make a pit stop at Mars.",6
all the astronauts suffered bone loss from the zero gee's - buzz could have broken every bone in his hand and still laid out the fucker,0
"You talk shit and call people a coward, you better be prepared to get punched in the mouth. Fact of life that the fat dude didn't seem to realize...",3
Good for Buzz.,0
street justice. got what he deserved. The beauty of being someone like Buzz Aldrin is how many people did he motivate and inspire to do dream and do something with their lives? We don't need anymore of these dough boys just trying to make a name for themselves off of the names of others who have achieved.,0
"That asshole got what he deserved. Actually he deserved a couple more shots to the dome, but unlike that piece of shit Buzz has class. Buzz is the definition of a hero.",0
"God bless Aldrin, wish he had had a combination left in him , a sweet left hook following the crisp right cross dropping the piece of shit would have been too sweet.",0
"In Canada we can these types of people bags of milk People think they can just harass and antagonize others  with no repercussions. Good for Buzz, way to fuck up that dumb ass bag of milk.",1
The guy is a fucking taxi driver.,0
Salute that man! Shoot fucko in the knees!,0
Beautiful!  Too bad there's no video of him afterwards crying at Dunkin Donuts stuffing his fat face with jelly donuts,0
The moon landings were obviously faked.,0
"""Soft serve ice cream eatin' Fag"" ..... fucking legendary insult!",0
What's better than a video about some obnoxious pos getting punched by Buzz Aldrin? A video about some obnoxious pos getting punched by Buzz Aldrin and narrated by Bill Burr. That's what.,0
Much respect to Buzz. This clip had a happy ending :-),0
one punch  artist :),0
Allenpalin Did you ever think that the reason Aldrin punched the guy was because he didn't like hearing the truth?  Calling the guy names because he called him out over false claims.Show me your proof that he landed if you're so positive he did! Amazing it was never done again after all the advancements in technology yet nada!!,0
Whoever believes that buzz or anybody else walked on the moon with that shitty video thats been shown to the world must be crazy! Don't you people ever question why it hasn't been done again with all the advancements in technology?  !!!,0
They should line up all the flat earthers an let buzz aldrin punch them in the face one by one,0
"I've heard about this but never thought it ever happened. Well, I can only say..Buzz Aldrin threw a cracking punch! Would have loved to see him follow up with a left then a kick to the head. Although I know he wouldn't, too much of a gentleman. Best thing I've seen all day! Good on Buzz!",0

"This is typical for A--holes with cameras...  I was hoping he would have killed him...  It would teach his mother to have another a--hole like him...   Good job, Buzz.....",0
Buzz is a bad ass. Check out the Ali G interviewing him.,0
"Wish I had been there. Would have loved to beat hell out of the chicken-shit calling him a liar. Wasn't there anyone else around to pound on the guy? You could have at least hit him with your camera and knocked out a few teeth.

Good he put that fat slob in his place. Who wears a blazer with jeans and sneakers ? Fucking big goof WHACK !!!!!!,0
"With all technology, there are postitives and negatives. The internet has given us much, but it's also given us conspiracy theorist nutbag shitlords. Why not focus on Guantanamo bay and the other real issues that the government tries to hide? Because you're the pussies and cowards.",0

He developed a lot of the eva techniques used to this day and worked on the development of orbital rendezvous, one of the toughest problems nasa had to solve before going to the moon.

It would be so great to take that icecream eating sack of shit up to the moon, show him Buzz' footprints beside the descent stage of the LEM and the American flag on the Sea of Tranquility, then leave him there.",37

"Easiest way to debunk moon conspiracy theorists...

""So... you're saying that the United States faked the moon landing because it was the cold war and we couldn't stand being outdone by the Russians, right? You do realise that less than a decade earlier, the Solviet Union put the first man into space, beating the USA, right... and that would have been much easier to fake. Also, a few years before that, The Solviet Union put the first satellite into orbit, beating the USA... So... what this means is that the USA was getting their asses kicked in the space race ALREADY. If there was a time to fake a satellite... or a person into space... or hell... even a moon landing, a decade before would have been the time to do it!""",1

"Funny Thing is of all the Apollo Astronauts to mess with, the one who has the reputation as a tough guy and a Brawler.  Yes Buzz is a coward, flew F86s in Korean war and strapped into a rocket filled with liquid Oxygen and Hydrogen, basically a Bomb. flew into space multiples times and walked on the moon. Attention conspiracy guys, you think if we didn't land on the moon the Russians wouldn't have been all over this.",0
The loser-fuck deserved every fuckin' bit of it and more. He should've been dragged into the nearest alley and beaten senseless.,0
That was a fucking great punch.,0
"Bill makes a good point. Kubricks an amazing film maker, but I don't think he's ""fool the KGB at the height of their power"" good",0
"it's interesting to me that he wouldn't swear on the bible...I mean, ya, tubby's being a cunt, but Buzz...just take 10 seconds to swear on the bible...even if you're lying, it would probably shut a lot of these people up...then again maybe it wouldn't...haha...entertaining as all hell, that's for sure
I don't know a single 80 year old that's that much of a badass!",0
"bill, put it this way. the Russians DID figure out that we lied about the moon. they weren't able to go there themselves because they could not figure out how to protect against the radiation belts. these belts need 4 foot thick LEAD walls for the astronauts to partially survive inside. even with the lead walls they STILL jwould have cellular damage.  and what did america send the astronauts up with??? a silly ship made of space blankets???",0
"even when they didn'T landed on the moon...how can you call a man who entered a rocket with a billion gallons of fucking flammable stuff to get out of the atmosphere a coward? dumb and a idiot maybe, but not a coward :D",0
Pow! Right in the kissa.,0
"""swear on the bible!"" lololol",0
Buzz don't  fuck around. My dude!,0
It would be more effort to stage the moon landing then cover it up for 50 years than just going to the fucking moon. Conspiracy theory a-holes are the worst.,0
"what a hero buzz is the man, that other git use to talking shit and geting away with it.",0
Gave him the ol' right there Fred!,2
"""Soft serve ice cream eating fag"" LOL",2
Buzz gave 'em the ol' right there Fred!,0
"Ok I'm confused - Bill is now a Moon Hoax dude, so this must be an old podcast.",0
"Buzz had every right to punch that fucking insect in the face. But , to tell the truth, what bothers and angers me even more than the fat conspiracy cunt is the stupid woman who is constantly pulling on Buzz's sleeve. I hope every time a stupid bitch takes it upon herself to grab on to a man's arm, right when she know he might need his arm free to fight, that the man abandons the fight, turns on her and beats the living shit out of her with closed fists. What is it with these stupid cunts and their need to exert power over men by hindering their movement at the worst possible times ?",0
Buzz certainty live like a baws,2
"Buzz could jump through whatever hoops this guy comes up with.  Swear on the Bible, take me to the moon and show me your footprints.  Dude isn't going to listen.",0
I love these videos. The editing just accentuates Bill's words making me laughing so hard! Oh and the comment section is always a gold mine.,0
Well done Buzz,0
Buzz is my hero!!!,0
Old school justice. Buzz ain't no coward.,0
This is how I want to watch every YouTube video,0
"and you could tell Buzz was stepping in to give him some more, too. Go Buzz. One of the coolest humans ever. Doctorate from MIT, shot down two MiGs in Korea, test pilot, walked on the moon.",0
"That's Buzz Fucking Aldrin! Whether we're talking Jimmy Lovell or some rooskie cosmonaut, those mutherfuckers that ventured beyond the stratosphere back when the best computers were little better than a basic calculator, they're all serious bad-asses and deserve some equally serious respect.",0
nice touch with the room 237 clips.,0
damn buzz yous a gangsta,0
That soft serve ice cream eating fag should feel lucky that he was laid out by an American hero,0
Fuck Buzz he's a fraud and should be in jail.,2
"Personally, Although I've seen and heard most of the evidence of the moon landing(s) hoax,  and I believe in a 911 alternate version of the official story,  specifically that it was an inside job, I don't believe in the moon hoax conspircacy.   I saw this video a few years ago, and give Buzz a big thumbs up for giving this ignorant fuck what he deserves.  I don't think there is a court in the United States that could watch this and convict him, and if they did, it surely wouldn't be justice served.",0
I didn't think a man in his 80s could punch a guy like that. Props to Buzz,0
That was a clean as punch.. you can tell Buzz done that before,0
"I love how the woman walks away mid-punch, right on the word ""coward"", like she's thinking ""oh shit here we go"". She doesn't even wait for it she just knows it's coming after he said coward 3:05",0
The only thing more awesome than Buzz punching him out is Bill Burr's commentary,0
They should have new law:  If a guy walks on the moon he gets to shoot one asshole no questions asked.  Call it the Buzzkill law.,235
heres a landing on your moon shaped face!! MERICA!,0
That was a right cross not a right hook.,0
Buzz rules  pay him his toy story royalties or this is what you get hollywood.,0
The dumbest I have ever heard Bill Burr.,2
"... and a liar, and a thiEFFFFFF",0
Buzz put some serious Fred to the head on that fat dude,0
"buzz handles it like a boss..

the girl knows buzz will beat his ass so she tries to move buzz away from the cock head..
she isn't trying to protect buzz from the guy.. she is trying to protect the guy from buzz.

1:43 he tells the cameramen to stop recording..

1:50  he does the 360 spin to get the girl out of harms way. 

3:05 the girl just walks away.. she knows there is no stopping buzz now..",0
"The KGB couldn't figure it out? Haha. As if the ownership classes of all these ""separate"" countries are NOT the same interlocking families. Banks and corporations have no national loyalties. Even if they were not all in cahoots together, the Soviet Union uses the same media lies and manipulation to control their people too, so it would be completely against their interests to expose another country faking stuff. Their citizens might catch on that they are doing it also. I hate that ""debunking"" point.",0
Do the doomsday preppers one,0
"The fucking asshole sounds like a real life version of Zach Galifianakis's effeminate character.

He deserved more than he got.

Buzz is a real life hero. 

The other guy's a silly little twat.",2
That right hook about knocked him out of his 'Nurse Reeboks',0
"Great daughter! She does her best to keep Buzz from whooping dude's ass, but she finally knows he crossed the wrong line and walks away right before Buzz throws a nice right hook to fat fucks face.",0
"Allen you been putting in work. I don't like you, but your videos are dope.",17
"everyone who sees this tub of shit should punch him again, just cause he's a tub of shit, Buzz is the man.",0
"Bill burr needs to shoutout your channel on his podcast. I just found your channel and I'm pissed I hadn't found it sooner, great work.",0
I like how you used an actual unexplained moon photo around 1:00 Good stuff as always btw,0
this is definitely my new favourite YouTube channel. please don't stop making these,1
"Buzz is an extreme badass.  Shot down MiGs in the Korean War, gets his Ph.D from MIT, and his dissertation is what they basically used for the Apollo mission.",0
"I'd just like to say, in light of recent events with what's going on in the world  who gives a fuck if we landed on the moon or not.
seriously there are places on earth we haven't been to and we're worried about who landed on the moon. ffs",0
Wait the moon landing wasnt fake????,0
"That was just the funniest thing i've seen for a while. Great right hook from Buzz. And made all the better for Bill's dry commentary, as usual. Who gives a fuck if the moon landing actually occurred, when i can sit down on my leather sofa with a cold beer and lmao to this stuff. Planet Earth's got everythin i need.",0
"""what would you say to the people who don't think the moon is real"" - Ali g to Buzx",0
The Soviets bill the Soviets.,0
"Damn, your vids are amazing.",0
He should have bitch slapped him instead !!!!!!!!!,0
Lol I think the moon landing was a hoax but bill saying he would have dropped from that punch made me laugh a lot,0
"The whole thing is fake and staged Aldrin and the fat fuck are actors just like those bitch slaves actors in the fucking Holocaust. The Earth is flat, any jackass can use the Pythagorean theorem to prove it to themselves, it's probably wise to start there.",0
"One small step for man, one giant punch for mankind.",61
"- ""You're a coward and a liar and a thflr"". - What's that last one, buddy? I couldn't hear it over the sound of your teeth loosening up and jostling against each other.",0
"You should've played your ""like a bawz"" audio right after Buzz hit that conspiracy loser.  Thanks for these uploads man, brightens my day.  =)",29
"So this fat fucking doughboy doesn't believe Buzz, but believes a book of hallucinations and hearsay from some goat herders and camel jockeys that didn't know why the Sun came up every day 5000 years ago? Hilarious. Awesome punch.",3
You da man! Would Love to see more MMA commentary. Really good Job on your Videos. Does Bill know about them?,0
"Keep em coming! 

P.s. What unit were you with? West coast, east coast?

I was easy coast 3/2 2009-2013",2
Way to go Buzz!!!!,0
"LOL... I don't know if this was done on purpose, but when the woman walked away from Buzz,(at 3:34) I SWEAR TO GOD her body language is ""let that sack of tubby crap have it, BUZZ....WHAMMMM!!!!"" Christ I can barely type this I'm laughing so hard.",0
Soft-serve ice creaming eating fag,263
That punch lifted that jerk off the ground...,2
"I wish every conspiracy theorist got a hard punch to the face. Spouting stupid conspiracy theories and misinformation should warrant a swift punch to the face. ""Fluoride in the water is making us retarded,"" ""chemtrails not contrails,"" ""vaccines and gmos are killing us,"" ""nwo, illuminati, etc,"" ""every shooting is a false flag,"" etc.",0
How do you even find half of these clips?!,2
"I get provoked real easy, not the answer but, nice orbiting loop punch to the disrespectful piece of ...",0
Right on buzz. that's how they handled it in his day.,134
"Bill said it the best ""Who gives a fuck if they landed or not!""",0
You gotta love BUZZ!,0
"'Soft serve ice cream eatin' fag'

Good God, that's priceless, hahahah.",6
"Every single one of these are awesome, Bill being Bill and the quality editing of these.",0
"""all quarter pounder with cheese..."" lmao",0
"I can't stand these fucking ridiculous conspiracy theorists who have nothing else better to do. These are the same idiots who believe that the world is flat, that we never landed on the moon, humans were born to the earth 2000 years ago, jesus was caucasian white and the Holocaust never happened.

on a side note, Buzz gets a hand shake for slugging this guy. You don't fuck with Buzz Aldrin.",1
I think this video of Buzz Aldren punching a fatty is a hoax.,0
the ol' right there Fred,0
"more of a straight right than a hook, but Buzz pops that dough boy good lol",0
420 blaze it,0
"Yeah, that guy's lucky Buzz wasn't just 70....he insults him and the memory of his friends who died in the Apollo fire in '67, and all of those who designed and built those incredible machines....what a moron.  2 seconds of thinking and research will debunk this stupidest of a conspiracy theories. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_evidence_for_Apollo_Moon_landings",87
SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM EATIN - LOL Bill Burrs the fuckin man I swear,0
well he didn't swear on the Bible lol,0
"literally the best thing i have ever seen!
what a punch.. rocked him!
was this recently?",0
"I don't know how anyone could question the reasoning of the fake moon landing. It's obvious Bill. Research the occult liars who founded NASA. Von Braun and Jack Parsons were both Satanists they both started the space program. The entire point of the outer space programs worldwide is to fool people into believing the Earth is a globe. The Earth is Flat Bill and you would be a fool not to research this topic. Look up Eric Dubay. The facts don't lie like Astronauts are payed to do. That cheeseburger eating fatty shouldn't of gotten in Buzz's face but Buzz and all the Freemason lying Astronauts deserve to be called thieves and liars because that's what they all are. There is no curvature Bill. All flights in southern hemisphere disappear on GPS tracking because the globe readings of distance are a lie. NASA has a serpents tongue in its logo. Why? NASA in Hebrew literally means ""to decieved."" Research Admiral Byrd and his Arctic escapades. He figured out the Earth was flat then immediately afterwards NASA was founded. It's the most deceptive conspiracy of all time.",0
you are a hero in the same league as buzz Aldrin for making these bro,0
THE MOON LANDING NEVER HAPPENED...  RESEARCH IT.,0
"""The KGB couldn't figure it out, but this tub of shit somehow did"" haha!",10
"I love it!  Good for Buzz Aldrin. The false moon walk conspiracy theory nuts are exactly that--nuts! It not only happened, there is ample evidence that it did. Sadly, the Internet breeds these cranks and they multiply like maggots.",2
I must feel so good to punch someone who wants you to swear on his sacred book. Buzz is the man.,0
We saw a rocket ship fly up & then we saw them fall out the sky with a pod. Man this people are delusional.,0
Buzz is the man,0
OMG!!. Bill Burr used the word fag. WE MUST STOP THIS ANTI-GAY PSYCHOPATH!!!!,0
YEAH BUZZ !!!!!!,0
Soft serve ice cream eating fag lmao,0
"Ah the good ol' days, when Bill could call someone a fag without having to to call himself out for being a ""homophobe""...",1
I hope Bill Burr gives you compensation for your work here.,0
You think you hard niggy?..... Done niggy..,0
"haha, props to punching a fattie",0
Bill has the best insults/descriptions of this sack of a man.  And good for Buzz.  Just imagine what Buzz could have done to this sack of shit if he was in his thirties.,13
"....you're a coward, and a liar, and a NNNNFFFF!",12
"really if you landed on the moon, why would it be such a big to not swear on the bible?  I mean I did it, I would swear in a heartbeat just to put it to rest.  But he didnt.  Hmmm",0
Asking an astronaut to swear on the bible is a weird move. What are the odds that someone who flew through the heavens and saw nothing but clouds still believes in god?,0
"Maybe the best part besides the POW was when the ladyfriend, after numerous attempts to pull Buzz away, knew the shit was getting real and simply let go @ 3:03.",0
"3:06
ahhhhh I love how fattys word ""thief"" came out... as it was coming out his mouth that NASA hook smashed his mouth at the same time and made ""thief"" sound stuttered... ""the heef.."" hahahahaha!!! amazing. 
thanks uploader",0
"how do u know he wasnt on the moon? were you fucking there? 
here is the thing with people and their beliefs...most are retarted..because.....here....I have a saying if its not on video or photo I dont care....like Michael Brown for instance....I dont give a fuck if 13 witnesses said the cop shot him in cold blood I need some video evidence.....and even then technology can trick us...your watching a video in court thats evidence in a rape trial but it was altered by a professional and nobody knew....and the case gets dropped....SO...basically....the TRUTH is SO SO hard to know...unless your two squishy eyes saw it.....Did he land on the moon? There is not enough evidence to confront someone about over this.......dont waste your time..... stupid people are everywhere and they are not aware they are stupid because they are stupid. ;-) 
Did Jesus or Muhammad walk the earth a long time ago? I dont fucking know and yoy want me to just believe a book that says its true??? a book.....its 2016 and a book that could have been wrote by a retard thousands of years ago before you were born....lul....stupid people....they are everywhere.....about 70% of the public is mentally fucked",0
Do the Buckner/Bartman breakdown,3
like a boss,0
I thought Buzz orbited the spaceship around the moon while the other two walked on it,0
You are doing gods work.,0
Buzz still mad he was 2nd man on the moon.,0
"Fuck, just got an America Boner, and have no way to get rid of it at work.",59
I can only imagine what Buzz would have done to him 40 years ago. I love this video!,0
sexy Asian chick at 2:35,0
Hope there's not gonna be a conspiracy theory about Buzz's fist landing squarely on that guy's moon-shaped fucking face.,1
Stanley kubrick!,0
"""probably outweighs him by a hundred and fifty fucking pounds, all quarter pounder with cheese though"" HAHAHAHAAHA fucking Bill, thats gold right there",0
"I love stupid people getting punched in the face, especially when they are carrying a bible. That makes it so much better!",3
the man has been on the moon. do you really think he gives a fuck about a human slug like this?,4
He is a lier because not only did he not walk on the moon but who says the moon is even something that can be landed on. It's not a rock in space that reflects sunlight. It generates its own light which is a cool light   Research it smart ass,0
These Moon landing conspiracy freaks are fucking dumb as a pillowcase full of shit.,0
"that fat douche trying to take short cuts by leeching off other's achievements, when fat douches do this their names and faces shouldn't make the news, blur it out so they remain a nobody the way nature intended.",0
fucking buzz hit him with a loaded fist lol,1
fuck yea,0
I don't know about the Moon but Buzz sure landed that punch,302
bang zoom! right to the moon! lol,0
"we didint land on the moon
 Nasa in hebrew means Deceive
apollo 11 means -apollo in greek means satan",0
Did Stanley Kubrick film the landing of this punch too?,8

"Bart Sibrel is a walking, talking piece of shit, and watching ol' Buzz right hook him gave me one of my greatest moments of satisfaction!  It's one of my all-time YouTube videos (almost four million views at last count):

"bill please stop holding back
tell us how you really feel",0
"Damn Bill sold out like a bitch he was real once but we all can't be Patrice a real nigga. Only fags left not homos but bitch boys who drink, smoke, womanize and watch sports to compensate for their lack of courage. I miss America the beautiful but beautiful only wants dangerous MEN and there ain't none here sad as hell boys",2
One right hook for man......,515
buzz frikn (not so light) years Ole man strgth! nice right hook.,0
That Punch footage was faked! - The real Buzz Aldrin never threw that Punch... it's all CGI and motion capture.,400
Yea I believe we went to the moon cause the TV said so and people on TV said so I believe what the TV said. We'll get those WMD's soon to just wait for the TV to say so,1
"Buzz landed a punch, I know that much.",2
Patrice = Truth/Billy Boy = Fear,2
Hahaha he gave him the ole right there fred!,11
Editing on point,0
"I love Bill, but if we didn't go to the moon, then where did the billions of dollars go that went into the whole project? That's the point of these conspiracy theories, following the money.",0
YES! Keep 'em coming! These are the highlight of my day.,0
"refreshing to hear the word ""fag""
in the non gay bash sense",63
"The tubby fat guy FOUND THE FAKED FOOTAGE when he went through the archives.  So, though I love Bill, I love his Boston outrage and anger, he can go fuck himself on this one.  We did not go to the moon. They faked pictures of the Earth.  They lied.  And the sickening 'convenient for comedy moral inversion', lying to the world, lying to Tax paying Americans is why our government is telling bigger lies now!  Let's not forget what Zionist pig did the CIA the favor filming the lie, it was Kubrick.  A Jew Hollywood demon.  A traitor for money!",6

"I love bill burrs podcast and the videos are great.  Thanks for the content, subscribed.",0
"Do the conspiracy theorists think that just the first one was faked, or that all of them are faked?",2
He punched him because he was right.  Only guilt could drum up that kind of violence.  Aldrin never went to the Moon.,4
why dont cheeseburgers come with a health warning? 'cheese burgers will slowly restrict blood flow to your brain and get you punched in your dumb face.',0
I shave my balls,3
bill burr can't let it go for some reason. they went to the moon. whoever thinks something else is just silly.,0

"I'm a fatty and I still agree with Bill..
Great work again, Boss!",7
Your stuff is tits. Keep it up hardcharger!,0
Buzz has a pretty solid right hand for a dude in his 80s. I know I sure as Hell wouldn't have risked talking shit to him.,0
Lol Bills insults to the guy that got smacked are fucking perfect.,0

"Aldrin finally punched Sibrel in the jaw, while being recorded. Sibrel later attempted to use the tape to convince police and prosecutors that he was the victim of an assault. However, it was decided that Aldrin had been provoked and no charges were filed. Many talk shows aired the clip, usually siding with Aldrin's response. Sibrel said later that he wrote a letter of apology to Aldrin",0
