When they feel threatened, by a fox, dog, bear, etc, they puff up to look bigger and then turn their back to the preditor...when they then try to bite, they get a mouth, face, and paws full of quils! If the quils are not removed, they get deeper and can migrate through the entire body, often killing the preditor! They, otherwise are very docile and calm. They are also very smart!

sorry i cant break down into tears after seeing something happen on the news. Its unfortunate but you see it ,take in what happened,learn from it,and move on. especially if you weren't involved with it.
if it happened to ones i love then yes, it would be traumatic.
if you're talking halfway across the world, something I have no connection to I am sorry to inform you that in general most people will do is say ""wow,again?"" or ""thats awful"".
Especially so right now in the U.S where many are trigger happy and that the East as usual is under attack by extremists.
Anyways,I think its actually you that needs to learn a little something. I grouped up what I said not based on the severity of the issue, but what personally causes me stress. Again, Im a realistic person and if you have problem with that,I can care less.

As a Dolphin, I can tell you, that's an ancient dialect used for traditional ceremonies honoring the precursors who brought life to this planet almost 4 billion years ago.
We use telepathy for everything else.

Also, we're not actually worried about your pollution output.
We were tasked 200,000 years ago to oversee your development and if anything goes wrong, our Atlantis megacity primary reactor has a built-in function that can restore life on Earth.

Unfortunately, if you fail the experiment, it's already been decided we're not going to try humans again.  The intergalactic committee thinks we're fools for even trying it a first time, but we saw promise in your opposable thumbs and inquisitive tool-making nature.

If this is TL;DR, I'm sorry.  Our telepathy is lethal to your species.",6

Hewas orphaned right after I was born and was found in a barn in West Texas. The nice rancher took care of me for a few days before I was taken to Zooniversity in Dallas. Allison, the owner there, became his Mommy and loved me lots. IHe used to make cute little squeeky noises so she'd pick him up. Now I, as an adult, he goes to schools and libraries ,so  people learn all about porcupines . He like the applause...and the sweet potato treats that  he eats while  he works.",0

You can see there are a couple of small ones right around his eye but nothing else.  Usually it's a mix of thick quills and that fine hair and they have them right up over their head.  When they tuck their heads in they turn into a ball of quills and the only way to get at them is to flip them over.  I'm guessing they pull the quills on a regular basis.,1
