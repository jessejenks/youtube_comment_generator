Don't do winged eyeliner or contouring if it stresses you that much.  Wean yourself off fuckboys if they're such a problem.  Wear stilettos for literally anything other than aerobic activity.

Because I have a really high arch,  I actually do very well for long periods in stack heel or block heel boots - they're my go-to for work/daily wear. The position of the heels doesn't bother me and the support of the heels balances things out so I don't stress my knees out too much. Stilettos or spikes in general are a nightmare, no matter what the hight, because my knees are just too unstable to compensate for them. So my anatomy means I can wear five inch stack heels on boots all day and be fine, but can't wear 1 inch kitten heels to walk across a room without chancing blowing out a knee. This explains the large number of stack and block heels in my closet."

That makes things even more painful. If your heel is too big, the back kind of grinds against the back of your foot with every step you take. And don't underestimate the dagger heels. My mom is known for being able to walk AND run in any kind of heels, and I showed her a picture of dagger heels once. She went 'NOPE'.\n\nI swear, the man survived an entire night in freakin' DAGGER HEELS, with added pain of the wrong size. Give Eugene a round of applause! ...And some bandaids, for pete's sake."

Why can't people look or feel attractive while also comfortable at the same time? I don't get it."

And as for Eugene, I'm shaking just my head but every fiber of my being says no.  Uhoh incline.  Wow Katie looks great!   Love that outfit!  That black, flowy jumpsuit.  So cute.  And those heels work. \n\nWhoa okay four plus hours that's impressive.  Lots of sitting which I totally understand but that was a good long run in heels.  Ned and Keith good for you for saving your feet.  Zach's feet are going to be fine.  His Achilles might be a bit sore the next day but he's so stable.  Eugene though.  Yah, stabbing yourself in the brain with a heel I get that.  Wait did he just hit on that blonde so he could lean on the gate?  Or on her?  Oh he's going to be in such pain.  Owch."
