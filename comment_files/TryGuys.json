Eugene was crazy for going with the dagger heels, but his stubborness made it work, Ned and Keith went ooh pretty when they really should have gone for practicality. There are two types of women who wear heels- women who can wear stilettos and women who wear ankle boots. Also, its not just a question of walking in them, because you can just horse step on the ball of your foot and have no problem, you also have to make it LOOK GOOD."

Stilettos or spikes in general are a nightmare, no matter what the hight, because my knees are just too unstable to compensate for them. So my anatomy means I can wear five inch stack heels on boots all day and be fine, but can't wear 1 inch kitten heels to walk across a room without chancing blowing out a knee.

And those heels work. \n\nWhoa okay four plus hours that's impressive.  Lots of sitting which I totally understand but that was a good long run in heels.  Ned and Keith good for you for saving your feet.  Zach's feet are going to be fine.  His Achilles might be a bit sore the next day but he's so stable.  Eugene though.
