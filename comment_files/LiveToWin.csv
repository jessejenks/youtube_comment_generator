"Everyone is talking about how they found this song through the South Parks WoW episode, but I originally remember it being in a fan-made WoW movie, way before the South Park episode.

I wish I could remember the name of it... it was something about a Night Elf who's master was killed, and so he trained to avenge his masters death and this song played during a training segment before the fight, or something like that."

The chosen undeads theme
"What the hell are you doing? Don't tell me you all quit playing World of Warcraft too?
Dude, we're done. We're sick of Blizzard feeding us that bullshit flying achievement. 
Guys, when things look bad, you don't give up on the world...of warcraft.
We don't have a choice dude. Our farming rep points are garbage if we're going to work for Talaan Diplomat.
I have a solution you guys. Our rep points is bad because we're working solo. But what if we work together to get more rep points?
We can't get rep points quicker because we're still on friendly. our trading post is level two, and worst of all, we're not humans!
That's why we're going to log in and ride to Magnarok, killing maws.
Maws?
There's a lot of slag and acid being generated in that area that has little to no travels. And that includes Mountainbreakers.
Dude, the highest rep point we can get for Frostwolf Orcs is 16, and that's without the rares. Do you know how many maws/mountainbreakers we need to kill just to get exalted?
Yes. For Slagmaw we need 4200 kills, Acidmaw 2625 kills, and Mountainbreakers 1312 and a half. And that's without rares.
For rares, its 53. Which could take two to four hours straight if we get this done quickly. You can just..you can just stay in all day playing fucking autisticcraft, or you can come back in and work your ass off for that flying achievement?"

"This song is terrible.  It is not the Paul Stanley of old.  The singing is forced and just plain bad, and the lyrics are neither inspiring or thought provoking as the title of the song would suggest.  All in all, a poor effort.  Time to retire."

worst lyrics ever
Fuck warcraft.
skydoesminecraft
"Hello all kiddies out here. I'm about to tell you a story about what this man did before this shit. You see Paul Stanley were born 1952 somewhere in New York, manhattan or queens i think, anywho he started a band with these other guys called Gene Simmons, Ace Frehley and Peter Criss back in 1973. And they named this band KISS, you've might have heard of them from your parents. Anyway these guys put on makeup and played something called rock n roll, and got all the girls they wanted and could do basicly whatever they want. Unfortunatly they tried mixing their music with the other really popular genere back then (disco), this was basicly the end of KISS. But you see instead of this garbage go check out KISS between 74 and 77. I know most of you will go Meh.. f dat imma go listen to some avicii or lil wayne or some brainless ""music"" like that. But even if i get one of you to go listen to it i'll be satisfied because you see the guys are gettin old and we need new heavy metal fans for this genere to continue to grow and get it back to what it used to be. And also if you decide ""hey i dig this"" dont start listning to the stuff after the 90's And whatever you do do NOT listen to grunge, you know nirvana and stuff like that. If you're after 90's music listen to Pantera, much better they basicly saved the entire genere. Wow this got way to long, anyways have a nice day everyone"
like if you r here for south park .. episode of warcraft ..
South Park.

"for all the people that missed the sensation of this rock band, Paul Stanley is from KISS. And they were pretty fucken cool until they did disco. Yes they were complete sell outs, and totally sold merchandise until their eyes swelled and exploded blood-money; but their cool songs are still pretty kick ass. Fun fact- dimebag was buried in a KISS casket. Yes they even sold kiss caskets... they put their name on everything. Watch the movie Detroit Rock City, good fucken movie guy"
You are awesome.
Respect...

You deserve a shoutout.
Listening to that when playing Dark Souls.
"Lol, no."
Lyrics are massively out of time...
This song forever ruined by South Park. I love it.
You know he wasn't serious right? He couldn't have made any more obvious.
SPIN TO WIN
listening to this song after a hard  day at work is just pure awesomeness
studying Ph.D hard while listening to this.
"Make Love, Not Warcraft!"
Playing this while getting some revenge.
"You know he was part of KISS, right?"
"You are just jealous, this song sounds awesome and we both know you'd love it if you could pull this off. Stop being jealous over other people's success and move on."
Oh look at the yeti and his big mouth talking!
HELL YEAH!
that how I got here as well
you deserve to be killed medieval style little fuck
GenerationHollow!
What have you achieved in your live then? have you made a bad ass popular song like this? I thought not.
i love world of warcraft =)
You just told everyone your opinion about this song but didn't argument it very well. Then you just said he needs to die for no reason but the fact that you didn't like this song. Just know that you cannot like every song. Just give better arguments and don't say stuff that don't make sense
2 000 000th
Emarrel anyone?
me too
SKYDOESMINECRAFT SENT ME HERE
"Wait, what?"
Best workout song !
"Make Love, Not Warcraft"
"And this ladies and gentleman, is why people use condoms..."
"Well some people enjoy it, that's your opinion of the song but just because someone doesn't agree to what you say doesn't mean you should bite there head off. It's a song, get over it you piece of shit."
"Guild Wars 2 - Jesse Lives to Win (Morgan's Leap)
Yeeeea WIIIINN :3

I think a lot of gamers heard this on southpark, i recognized the song when jesse cox was frustrated on the gw2 stream.. but that video just makes it epic xD his little roar at the end .. <3"
SKYDOESMINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!
"I came here from South Park's ""Make love not Warcraft"" epizode :P
KISS rock and so does Paul! \m/"
"Oh Satan, your such a geek. get a gf or some shit cuz u got no life LOSER !!"
"You're* calling someone out on the misuse of ""a dot"" in a proper sentence* by calling that person a dumb piece of shit. Yet you can't figure out why there's a bunch of red lines underneath your comment. 

By the way, that ""dot"" is called a period. It goes at the end of complete sentences*. There are no spaces in between the last word of a sentence* and the punctuation of said sentence*."
"""your sentense"""
u forgot a dot at d end of your sentense your a dumb piece of shit !!!
SOUTH PARK!
My favorite muisic.(Remember South Park : make love not warcraft and World of Warcraft)
"When you have someone who claims to love you says you are responsible for your brothers suicide, its real easy to feel this way"
Im farming with this Song in firefall....
"yeah right, you probably smoked weed or something. Nothing serious"
"Make love, not warcraft."
Say that to my face and I'll do the same to you as I did to that cashier dude.
Twice is a lot dude
"I really can't. You have no reason to be suspicious at me, I've only been in jail twice, and I did my time!"
This music is awsome!
"He didn't make this song because he enjoys playing WoW. It could be a song that a soldier who's been deployed in Afghanistan for months without his family knowing everyday he has to fight to live. This song could be for a widow who has to take care of her children by herself and listens to this song to get through the tough spots in life. This could be for a athlete who has been training years to get to the spot he has been trying for. So just shut the fuck up, your logic makes no sense."
I listen to this when I'm training because it gives me a psychological boost and to be honest is the best thing to listen to when i'm are going full sprint and touching 40mph (road cycling). Someone can listen to it when they are doing a game it doesn't matter. Just lighten up a bit.
"Well you can understand my suspicion, over the past few months this video has been the target of many trolls, making fun of people just for enjoying this song and enjoying the games they listen while they watch it. I'm sorry for judging you too quickly, it's your opinion and I respect it."
"What the hell is your problem? Everyone knows that the guitarist in Kiss is Robert Trujillo. Even retards should know that. You just assume that I'm a troll, but what the hell makes you think that everyone who gives another opinion are trolling? I feel really sorry for you. You got nothing better to do than accuse others for doing stuff they haven't done! Get a life, asshole, because you're going straight to hell where you will be poked with pitchforks for all eternity. Good luck, dumbass."
"If you're going to troll, at least don't make it so obvious."
"Oh my fucking god! This music is litererally the shittiest thing I've ever heard! There's absolutely no way this Paul Stanley dude could ever make it big. He's just a low-life. He could never ever compare to a band like Kiss! He claims to live to win, but he's just a loser. He would be lucky to even meet Gene Simmons and all the other band members in there. He deserves to die. Period."
Fun fact: That's your opinion.
"I've done RPG grinding before while listing to this song as well, and I'm afraid... YOUR COMMENT SUCKS!"
You did something like that with zombies and costed your life :P
"( •_•)
(•_• )
You can't prove I did nuttin..."
"Got a job interview in an hour and a half. I am putting together a playlist for every job interview drive containing this song, Gonna Fly Now, Eye of the Tiger, You're the Best, Live to Win and Sweet Victory. I need to keep pumped when going in."
I want to play this song on the speakers in my car and drive around following joggers
"Are you gonna stay outside in the sun and bounce around a ball, or are you gonna go on the computer and do something that matters?"
The International 3~
When I play World of Warcraft ! Thanks South Park !
This is the song I play when I am studying for finals.
"this song plays when I go level grinding in......pretty much ANY RPG
Pokemon, Darksiders 2, Paper Mario, etc."
(guitar solo)
"Fuck, this supposed to be a motivational song. And there comes the South Park :D Make love, not Warcraft!"
MAKE LOVE NOT WARCRAFT :D !!

MRG!
south park
You clearly have no idea how a teenagers mind works.
Keep clicking Kyle you can do it!
how dare you
"Fuck, now I wanna play MMORPG !"
Jovem Nerd - Wow me trouxe aqui
"no, your mother brought you on this planet so technically she brought you here and not South Park."
homework song ^^
I have never seen such a cluster of stupid comments.
Not everyone who enjoys an MMORPG looks or acts like the guy on South Park who had no life of any sort.
Skydoesminecraft sings this XD
Idem XD XD ahahaahaah bella però!
south park brought me here
yes i do....belgium FTW
"Thanks for you're opinion about this subject, but I this song just brings up memories.Nostalia,As it's called. And btw What's with all you're (BADASS WARRIOR)  I never felt like much of a Big Shot in Wow at all. You're just making up aruments to support you're opinion. But to be honest... It did'nt really work. PS:The word/name ''Gamer'' is a very powerfull word sir... don't underestimate it."
MAKE LOVE. NOT WARCRAFT
"Scientific evidence?
It's just my opinion for the meaning of the song, and in my opinion, anyone who hears this song can figure out that to ""Win in life"" is to achieve"
It sounds good on paper but i doubt there is any scientific evidence for that claim.
"Insults is not solid arguments. Its logical fallacies.

Hence, you talk a lot of bullcrap.

If it was all about lyrics then you would not listen to this song - you would listen to the instrumental version of. Since you're here, that proves you don't. Of course lyrics means something otherwise they wouldn't be used."
man u aer just a piece of crap i really fucking hope you die tbh
"u good at explaining stuuf, ur not winning now cos this is not usefull but good explaining man! xD"
WoW FTW!!!!!
"Doesn't have to do anything with what you said
Southpark had an episode about WoW called ""Make love, not Warcraft""
They had a montage where the boys train, and they put this song in the background to laugh about people dedicating their life to WoW, by wasting their time on that game they basically do the opposite of living to win (as I mentioned in my last comment)

This song just reminds him of the montage and makes him want to play the game again since it brought back memories."
"I'm not sure if you're trolling or not, so I'll just answer seriously

To win is to achieve, even if that achievement is being a good student by doing your homework
Living to win is doing something useful with your life, not sitting around and wasting it on unproductive things, going out, working out, having hobbies, being good at something and developing skills

This song gives you motivation to ""win"", to achieve, that's what it stands for."
"No shit, music gives me hope for the future :)"
sky
lift to win
Guitar solo played on the guitar of 1000 truths
"Hahahaha, even though I kind of share your point of view I must say that you really come off as a sore thumb up your own rectum! However, your messages here really cracks me up as I imagine you are the Squidward of the interwebz. There are so many other things to get needlessly pissed off about here in the world so you better start pooping that hate like a golden goose and get on with it! Go, go go!"
"I don't play WoW and I'm not ""a stupid gamers,""(good grammar there) just like the song. Trololol"
"Thank you South Park, for giving me this great song. Without SP I would not know it."
"""Point"" = Unproven for a reason. Teens are amazing, cool, and some of the greatest people alive."
Charlie Sheen's favourite song.
P.Y.R.O
"What if you're actually training for or participating in a competition and are listening to this song? It would kind of fit in that situation, wouldn't it?"
Pretty stupid since spell checking pretty gave it away.
"Then you are as stupid as you said I am, since you're doing exactly the same thing right now.

If you don't want to discuss this, then you are free to leave."
"You kinda proved my Point when I said that only stupid teenagers listen to this crap.

Yeah, I know what you're thinking about. Playing WoW while feeling like a badass warrior. Do you understand how retarded it sounds? You feel like a badass because of a game... you listen to this song and its lyrics, and Think you are a big shot and a true warrior when you in fact are just a gamers.

Proves my Point: teens listen to this crap and Think they are clever."
"probably typo, cuz he spelled it correctly in the beginning"
"Says the guy who can't even spell ""Stupid"" correctly. Dumbass."
"Tell me more wise one. Teach me your vast knowledge of life and all it's mysteries, and why Paul Stanley is mediocre and unenjoyable."
Just because can do your homework while listening to ''live to win'' doesnt make you a warrior. The fact that people Think they are warrior because they listen to it proves the opposite
"""Live to win"" as in overcome all the hardships life throws at you, you ignorant inbred fuck."
The only guide to living you need to know.
south park - eposide make love not war.
"You can just hang outside in the sun all day, tossing a ball around. Or you can sit at your computer and do something that matters"
Does anyone wants to start playing WoW again after listening to this?
lol :) it's so easy to troll on youtube!
"You look like you could do with it whilst doing your own homework.

You misspelled ""stupid"" and you use capital letters at random.
Go back to your English class, do your homework then use your free time after homework to go on YouTube."
His teacher apparently.
moi
South Park <3
"sky sing this when he win , so I decided to listen it , LOL"
mom!! more hot pockets!!!
still better than kiss :D
Who pissed in your cereal?
"Oh, shut up."
on South Park they used the best part of the song really well
south park destroyed that song xDD its so funny when i hear it
"Oh, yeah that was pretty dumb."
*Your*
South park - La fureur de perdre :D
"Most of them I can, but some are just too easy to make a bitch out of, which doesn't make it 'pretty sad'. It's tempting. Go away, troll."
"You can't ignore some scrub on the internet?
That's pretty sad.."
southpark brought me here!
"Thanks, man. The arrogance and stupidity of some people on the internet is just too hard for me to ignore. -.-"
"What's wrong with the attitude ""Live to Win""? It's about kicking ass in everything you do, striving to be the best of the best (and leveling up in World of Warcraft)."
"If I could thumb up your replies to RRC, I would."
south park
"I'm being critical of your 'intelligence'. You're argument was that this song was stupid and that the people who listen to it are stupid. I said this first, 'I AM NOT IN ANYWAY DEFENDING THIS SONG AS A MEANINGFUL SONG'. The point of my comment was to call you out. The errors I pointed out in my comment were not the only ones, so therefor you can't say shit. I just hope you know that there are many teenagers listening to this, that are much smarter than you. Shut the fuck up and get lost, troll."
The lyrics mean tackle everything in life head on and don't give up if your losing
your australian no wonder you hate this go get braces and shut up its a good song
Skydoesminecraft brought me here
Isn't Red River a rip off?
"If you didn't care, you wouldn't respond, duh.

If you have nothing valuable to add to this discussion then please don't respond at all."
"Please stop give fucks about who listens to what and get out and play in the sandbox with your friends.
After that you can go home, tickle your moose and go to bed, otherwise mommy might be mad."
Someone has sand in their vagina.
I was just asking a question and you assume i'm giving you hate.
Alright sorry i am stupid for that lets just forget it and have our own opinions.
"You just proved my point: It is just a saying that makes no sense as a reply to my statement.

There, you just made yourself look even more stupid."
Its just a saying and i dont need to go to science class fag.
"Nope, I didn't say that. You said that.

My assumption was clearly right: pre-teens and teenagers listen to this crap. Just look at all the hate I get for putting my opinion out here for you to look at."
"How can a song possibly be gay?

You need to go to science class and learn something, mate."
"I wrote ''stupid'' two times before. Clearly I made a MISTAKE when I wrote ''stupod''. Isn't that obvious for you? No it clearly isnt.

You're just trying to stay away from the discussion by insulting me. Because you have no proper contra-argument to my arguments."
"I am not in anyway defending this song as a meaningful song. It's dope, and you're a fucking idiot. Do you really feel great when you go about youtube videos calling people stupid when you make silly English mistakes? It's *losers and *stupid. There's also no random capitalized words in the middle of a sentence. You should have done your homework instead of jerking it, moron."
just becuase you are gay dosent mean the song is gay stfu faggot
Coming from the person who listens to nicki minaj and justin bebier and lady gaga shut up you pathetic faggot
"Yay guys, my life is worth less then some one who has time to post a comment on a song he says is only for children. Also guys I did not know that the song-writer of kiss wrote adolescence songs, wait never mind obviously all those songs written in the 80's where made for the y2k generation."
shut your mouth dickhead u r a asshole
Skydoesminecraft?
South Park!!!!!!!
me too! xD
"So, you live to lose? So, you aim to lose all the time?"
Shut up dumbass YOLO freak.
"Arguing on the internet is like winning the Special Olympics: Even if you win, you're still retarded."
Did it take you all day to come up with that one?
Go Paul! Dragon Paul Z!
I could almost take your comment seriously if you had any boundaries of basic english at all.
"Try looking in a mirror sometime because I just found someone who is more annoying, uneducated, AND a bigger dumbass all in one place."
"1.Judging by how big of a dick you are I don't want to know you.
2.I can guaranty several adults listen to this song.
3.Jerking off doesn't count.
4.No, we're angry because your a sad little man who is full of himself.
5.Just because you happen to be a failure doesn't mean everyone else is a pathetic loser who is a waste of air. Outside your sheltered little life there are people winning, something you will never experience because you are to busy trolling to try and get some recognition."
you sir are right! i would thumps up but it is hiding!
"A certain SOUTHPARK episode seems to have given this tune a new lease on life. After all,  that's why I'm here."
"''Neutral stance''

And then you're Calling people trolls and keep up the argue?

You don't even know me yet you make assumptions. What I said about this song is exactly what I think. Maybe you just give proper ARGUMENTS insteadr of just empty opinions that has nothing to do with the discussion at all."
.....SKYDOESMINECRAFT!
"Make love, not Warcraft!"
"No dude, i simply mean, stop arguing about music or peoples comments, its quite sad in my opinion, you surely have better things to do than to give into trolls, like i said just enjoy it. So rather than arguing at me who is taking a neutral stance just shush lol"
eaw o i am not ded
Thumbs up if you got here buy watching south park
"MAM, BAFFROOM, BAFFROOM."
best wow song ever
"I'd prefer not to be mindless and just go along with the song without thinking about it. The only reason the subject came up is because that RRC guy started talking shit and saying that the song was meaningless, so I felt the need to inform him that every song has a meaning. I then went on to explain to him what I thought the song meant, but by no means did I ""get all philosophical""."
I fucking love southpark!!!
Like if got here from South Park!
what does stupod mean
"What the fuck are you retards on about? Stop looking too far into the lyrics for meaning, and stop trying to get all philosophical and smart, it's a fucking song. If you wanna meditate and postulate go comment on a fucking Buddhist chanting video Listen to it, appreciate it, share it. Win."
South Park.
"i know u feel so badass and wise from your comment, or you just wanted to get a big response (congratulations). Both of these things are pathethic and i don´t know why you went there to write this. ""Win what?"" you call us all pathethic teenage kids and you can´t even get it . Win something means just achieve something. This song is about great will to don´t give up and try hard to achieve your dreams. And all the philosophs agree that ""childish stupid fantasy"" is  the best fantasy."
"You can't even spell ""losers"" right."
"Wow dude, you're perhaps the biggest dick I've seen in the comments for a while now, that's something else lemme tell ya'..."
Is there any possible way to rape the replay button harder?
why does the first part sound so different from the second part. i prefer the second part
"thumps up, if South Park brings u here ^^"
"This song is for the manliest people. Now enough, RRC."
"Also, usually when a person says: ""live to win"", it means that you should strive to succeed at everything you do and aspire for greatness."
"But, as I said, one cannot determine the true meaning of a song until one asks the artist. Before asking, one can only make a hypothesis."
"Just because the meaning of the song isn't something you can figure out just by using intuition doesn't make it meaningless. Also, since I suspect you know little to nothing about the artist, you really can't say anything about the song besides whether you like it or not and your reasoning behind your opinion can't be anything like ""the lyrics are ignorant and empty"" because, again, you haven't asked the artist what the song means. I like the song because it sounds like it's about perseverance."
"I'll have to redirect you to the vsauce video stating that life basically is a game, which you should try to win."
"Classy. :P

You expect pop songs to use poetry by Goethe? I understand that you're trying to seem pretentious and self-important, but let's be honest, you're fooling no one."
Keep clicking Kyle you can do it!
"How on Earth did I admitt that?

Then I must have ''admitted'' something that is false because i train rugby"
"""I do sport"". Right there, you just admitted that you rarely see the light of day."
"1. You don't know me.

2. This song is childish and aimed at Children (and stupid teenangers)

3. I do sport.

4. Really? You're just angry because im right


5. Something I can't understand? This song is pathetic, a pure fantasy ''live to win'' dont you hear how retarded that sounds?"
It is of an episode of it they were playing world of warcraft. have a good day :)
BURN
U jelly cuz you already lost
"1.you are a freaking nerd
2.this is the best inspiration song
3.go do some sport nerdy
4.fk yourself
5.this is something what you cant understand..... because YOU LIVE TO LOSE NOOB"
we get it you're desperate for attention momy and daddy didn't hug you enough as a child we all feel sorry for you...
awesome song yeah yea
"Hey, troll how you doin?.Now here's your bait get me a single song that has good lyrics.Shouldn't be too hard,right? go on now get started looking."
"I am a nerd? Really? You don't know crap about me!

You're just crying out loud because the truth hurt you."
You're an idiot. Go do something real. Cya nerd.
Sport has nothing to do with it just makes it more stupid and it makes YOU look more stupid. I reckon you listen to this childish crap when playing with your kiddy football
You obviously don't play sports. Go outside nerd.
"wow chill dude.... its just a song.
nothing more. and good lyrics are very rare, so this song is no exception.
so far, have a nice day"
"Here is the rub.

Lyrics for this song is crap. It is suited for stupid, retarded teenagers. You probably do your homework while listening to this pathetic song and Think that your some kind of warrior... fucking fools. You are loosers. Also ''live to win''? Win what? You pathetic kids Think its all about winning, but winning WHAT really? The lyrics is ignorant and empty, and give a vision of some childish stupid fantasy.

Now, get back to the REAL world and stop pretending stupod fools."

Is the how or the why really that important? Whether they were directed here or grew up with the music is irrelevant. What matters is that they come back once again.

Why don't you go fuck off. Only 10 year old kids and idiots respond to trolls. And one more thing: all you have to do is lie about your age.
Thought so.
Lets do some farming
"Hey guys, look what I've found ! A retarded kid who thinks he is the master of the World. Look at you. You must be 10 years old to act like this. Now go to the corner, you've been bad."
"Stop being such a dick, no one likes an insufferable prick like you."
jeez kid calm down its the freakin internet... where there are trolls everywhere
"ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff!,,,,gholppo iouu!!"

Fucking hippies! Just listen to the track and enjoy!:O
"No pecs, no sex"
Why? Because you can change it? You need valid resources in order to keep the informaton on there dipshit
It's true. Matt & Trey got to debut the song to the world. Pretty darn cool.
"Well more trustworthy than you...
But okay, Southpark's ""Make love, Not Warcraft"" aired october 4th. 2006
""Live to win"" came out october 24th 2006 acording to his own website."
Who the hell believes wikipedia!!!!! It's the least trustworthy website!!
"On Wikipedia it says

""The album's title track was featured on the South Park episode ""Make Love, Not Warcraft"", twenty days prior to the album's release."" So he is niether, he is right...."
I play WoW to this
i work out broski. i even lift
"Not sure if Troll, or just pure stupid"
Need some /fit/ in your life brah
"Grinding in WoW right now. needed motivation.

Insert personal assumption on another persons state. Argument denied. Try again.
You just are terrible at it and mad because you can't afford the months of game time.
And that is why the game is totally gay.
Adventure up there!
TILL THERE'S ONE MORE BREATH TO GO!
At the moment I'm probably more excited over finding my Pokémon yellow :D
"People got it to an unreasonably high level for a while. I've played the betas, it's good by it's own merits. No need to make it out as something bigger then that.
It'll be fun and it'll be needed, the evolution continues :)"
"Sir yes, sir. 
Or well I did more before then I do now. Still I'll be spending quite some time in WvW"
That's what Guild Wars 1 is for :)
"That's quite a bit of grinding
Aren't there usually guides for the optimal spell rotation fairly easily accessible on the webz? 
Sounds more like it's time-consuming then hard"
"It is hard once you reach level 85 , you need to set up a spell rotation by researching it , go through dungeons and raids 100 times just to get decent armor."
Assuming WoW is any kind of hard
winning isnt everything...its the only thing
Ok this is charlie sheen's theme song!
"I really want a karaoke version on youtube, so far i havent found one."
"YEAH, LIVE, YEAH, WIN"
You archiving or something?

There IS a replay button. When the video ends look at where there's supposed to be the play/pause button
"i love it. 
you tube should have a replay button"
I'm tired of clicking the replay button. I wish there was a 100 hour version of this :D

"They throw everything at HIM.  Politics, Religion, Law/Order, Gender battle of relationships, and so on.

One man versus an entire nation who WON.

Sad..."
"To continue below.

These guys buying big houses talking shit on HIM... these guys are getting laid by these WOMEN.  These men and women who hate him along with SOCIETY are trying to put him in prison.  HE is still sitting on that computer. Even his friends he use to play with are in on this.  They all are saying hes gay and worships demons (haha) and hes a loser.  Hes never done anything

IN REALITY...  HE IS ROYALTY AND DOESNT EVEN KNOW.  WHILE SOCIETY IS BUTT FUCKING STUPID THEY HAVE NO CLUE."
"Imagine someones life who carrys a camera wherever he goes (thats how WE know whats going on).  Everyone that he met that started something to put him in prison and he doesnt know, mainly his friends and family that backstabbed him and became retard ""celebrities"" and rest of usa. Women are going out clubbing and giving guys blow jobs in vehicles and sex in parking lot as HE is on the computer. Guys going out shooting guns talking shit thinking they are the best as HE is still sitting on computer"
I cant believe this.
And why do you care enough to provide a response?

Actually since the cataclysm patch came out its very different...
I support your life choice even if I don't choose it.
"Yes, terrible logic but he is right!
WoW may be really be old but that doesnt make it shitty...
Its one of the best games out there!"
SPIN TO WIN!!!!!!!!
i love men
"Sat here playing WoW right now, rocking out to this, living to win."
That was terrible logic sir...
"Yeah, but southpark gets a revamp.  Their ideas remain fresh and new while WoW stays the same old, same old.  South park does a reboot every 1-2 seasons while WoW has fundamentally stayed the same from the beginning.  It's BORING and shitty!"
I entertain myself by doing so.
"I'm talking about the episode, dumbass."
why do you even bothor talking to me
"To everybody talking south park or world of warcraft (south park refrence) Fuck you, This song was out before that shit show."
"Hehe, well I knew it was released in 2006, but yup last time I checked it isn't 2010 :)"
"Some one can't count. Was released in 2006, was 6 years ago. Shit...2006 was 6 years ago, time flies."
I listen to this while I play WOW
South Park brought me here.
i lisen this when i play wow ;D
SPIN TO WIN :D
How many people pissed their life away with this while playing world of warcraft?

I pride myself off of ones such as you.
*existence
"TILL YOU DIE, till your cock fucks in her eye"
you realy dont know wat ur talking about
Exactly. I mean come on League of Legends is better xD
As for yourself.
This is what happens when you prove you have no life when playing World of Warcraft.
"Lol come back when you have something of importance to say, sport."
"Something of which you must, and shall."
Lol you obviously don't know how to troll the right way. You have much to learn young grasshopper
"Are we,  both, not right now?"
"motha fucka all there, yeah!"
... reads comment section...  scrolls back up and listens to good music.  Life is good.
"LOL what's the matter, don't feel like trolling little boy?"
"LOL what's the matter, don't feel like trolling little boy?"
As for one yourself.
Good comeback little jimmy.
"""faggot"" was your wording. I rest my case. By the way League of Legends is a better game."
Such as one yourself.
I think the whole thing is hilarious honestly
Lovely words for a youngster
Hypocrisy at it's finest right here
"Holy shit, the amount of nerdy Wow rage in this video is TOO DAMN HIGH"
actually I am 21 year ol and you must be a 40 year old virgin who can only talk shit over the internet....
Your intelligence suggests so.
Ok then how do u know
"And you're an 8 year old faggot.

Good day, ma'am."
Why the fuck are you getting annoyed about how old you have to play world of warcraft. It's a piece of shit game and whoever plays it has no life and go outside and play sports or have a real hobby than sit inside and play games or bitch on youtube all day.
"No, you're not 18.

You're lying to not only yourself, but to everyone who knows your existance."
im 18 i think im old enough to play so get off it i bet ur bluffin
Yup

"@SubtleNinjaDude I agree with TheJackInman on this. Not about the not having to like the whole song thing, I mean the part about this song having a great chorus and mundane all the rest. But I mean, of course he's right about the other thing he said, that just goes without saying. I don't think I have to link rap music to demonstrate this."
@SubtleNinjaDude Yes because it is impossible for someone to only like one part of a song without being a troll. I also like pie but not the crust. Does that still make me a troll? Grow up.
this song is fucking epic

"Bwahaha, South Park made me love this song SO MUCH!!!

""How do you kill that which has no life?"""
"@MelRon3023 were you dropped on your head as a child? or did your mother mate with a big mac? because that would seriously explain you.  go facepalm a steel spike, it might sort you out. and you need to learn the difference between anger and expression.


This song FUCKING ROCKS! (after all, its the reason we are here)

Peace x"
SOUTH PARK! HAHA
"@seedl69 And you sir, are an angel. Common sense isnt that common these days. Youtube should be a place for artistic inspiration and appreciation but instead its a breeding ground for intollerence. Live and let live. Whether your black, white, left, right, metal or everything else that isnt metal. Show your love for what you love. It goes a long way. Hating on others for not liking what you like just makes you a troll...and you should go back under your bridge and let the world carry on. Peace x"
"@MelRon3023 Dont let the ""f word"" confuse you. I meant everything I said. Including the ""peace"". ""FUCKING"" doesnt necessarily mean I dont wish peace on others.
It just reflects my mood at the time I posted the comment. Dont be quick to pass judgement. Take a minute to let it sink in and wrap your mind around the whole comment. Dont just pick on the curses and form your oppinion based on how much I swear. Or did you just feel the need to say any FUCKING thing? Peace x"
@themannyxx Exactly. I wish everyone on the internet had as much common sense as you.
"you have to be blind to misclick the like button...thats not what it is...people DONT LIKE THE SONG!!! AND THEY ARE FUCKING ENTITLED TO NOT LIKE IT!! DONT LET PEOPLE CRITICISE YOU FOR WHAT YOU FUCKING LIKE AND LET OTHERS DISLIKE WHAT THEY FUCKING WANT!! WE ARE NOT, I REPEAT, WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE FUCKING IDENTICAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.....individuality man...live and let fucking live...live to win, awesome song I LIKE IT. and i aint forcin anyone else to. peace"
South park brought me here

@ozzynirvana123 yeah dude that was a hilarious episode
"@pinkeinke2 I'm pretty sure EVERYONE know's who Kiss is, they might just not know that its the Paul Stanley from Kiss."
"@pinkeinke2 Lol, I expected you knew who he is, otherwise you wouldn't have made such a sarcastic comment ;) :p"
"@pinkeinke2 I've seen him on Graspop Metal Meeting, this Sunday, Kiss guitarist + vocals"
"make love, not warcraft"
Reminds me of South Parks episode.
@spartythespart yea the ep was called :make love not warcraft
"@LuckySharm In like episode 10 of some season of South Park they had a ""World of Warcraft"" episode where all the main characters stayed inside grinding away at the game for a very long time. The song for the montage was Paul Stanley's ""live to win""... A crapload of people watched that episode and now anybody who has seen it associates this song with either World of Warcraft or South Park."
"@LuckySharm Because South Park is awesome, and whoever doesn't like it, is a dick :D"
"First time i listened to this song i heard ""Cheat to win"" 0o"
ahah greatest song ever for gaming!
Why does everyone think of World of Warcraft when they hear this song?
@Sn1peRbr0Pr0duct10ns the forsaken hates the scourge -.-
"@ThePieStoreGuy your right, sorry"
cool
badass song
@Gloudas Undead my friend. Hail to the scourge.
GO HORDE!! ALIANCE SUCKS
"LIVE TO WIINN! awesome song^^ just been to a Kiss concert yesterday in Arnhem, and old Paul Stanley still gots it!"
"@JohnnyCade3 I think you're stereotyping a bit much

(Triple post!!!)"
"@ninjavanish09 Bro, you're mad."
@JohnnyCade3 People who say that tend to be as well.
@JohnnyCade3 Which is why I'm glad for the non-faggy people who break the mold.  Such a refresher!
@JRod527763  Same here. TFS DBZA episode 15 ftw.
i found one of his comments making fun of people who play wow and i agree... people who play wow tend to be faggy nerds
@superguitarhero i did the same thing.. i wonder what he did say
Goku brought me here.
South Park WoW episode FTW!
@ninjavanish09 that entire paragraph absolutely made no sense
"@ninjavanish09 

i hate small minded people like this guy like seriously just fucking die, one less stereotype to even worry about in the world. i haven't even played wow before and im getting mad! Like come on there is nothing to a guy when he bashes something he does not like. Just leave them alone Faggot. If it makes them happy that they play wow then i say "" Play all you want fellas!""... Makes me wonder if the people i yell at have a mental disorder"
i cant find this song on itunes
wow SP ;)xD
"@thewhulk the chuck norris thing was a joke, no need to point out his age, and when i said i have 5 friends, i wasnt trying to prove myself, i was saying what some else said earlier, that not all wow players are addicted, some just play in their spare time. i can agree that it is the internet, and we should get over it, but when someone says something you like sucks, wouldn't you say something back? also, that last little line there, makes me wonder if you're as small minded as ninjavanish09."
"LIVE TO WIN
*"
this song is good type in south park live to win
"@Tinarion No worries, happens to the best of us. :)"
When was this song made?
"He never left KISS, he and Gene Simmons ARE KISS."
Lol my friend listens to this song everytime he is fighting a dungeon boss in WoW.
@noboooody0 no what?
Epic song for PvP
"@Dlugi198 Dude i have, yes it is very funny i love south park and i usta be a pure wow fanatic lol. but no one thinks about the song i mean jeez."
"@poop4215 

Oh noes not wow"
"@kobiwazere Watch Season 10 ep.8 ""make love, not warcraft"" of south park and you will see why."
"Whats with the comments of this song about south park n WoW, shouldnt it be about the artist and song?"
"@NixLB Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, he doesn't know that yet!"
@UnF0cuS I like how you think.
"@ninjavanish09 You are pathetic its pretty simple. You lack intelligence, typing like that shows how much of a dumb ass you are, and lazy considering you can't show any intel. You're pathetic for going on the damn video commmenting, pretty much basically saying get a life, I think you should just stop, Moron. You are a 10 year old, you need to mature up, I useed Twat, Fag, when I was 8 so mature up."
who would sing shit like this. mabye it sound good but the lycrics seriusle sound bad !! who would live to win till you die?
@ninjavanish09 troll...
"@ninjavanish09 You're pathetic, some 10 year old on a computer again. I find it funny how some one like you think others are pathetic, yet you simply comment on a video thinking you're better. Shut the fuck up, take an English class, and learn how to type."
@TrulySilentLie Yes.
WARNING .You can NOTICE this song brings bad luck!:(
"@sage3995 Is the song in the episode? Make love, not warcraft?"
@TrulySilentLie South Park
"Okay, I can't see the connection between this epic song and WoW. What is it?"
"@ArchieIsted You complain about someone's Grammar yet you cant spell that word, fail :/"
"@Dennis484 wow.... your that big of a nerd are you? chuck norris is 72 
im pretty sure he couldnt win a fight against a Mc Donalds Big mac. + 
no need to prove yourself by saying: ""i have 5 friends"" 
that just makes you look insecure + this is the fcking internet!!!
FAKE GAY AND YOUR MOTHER BIATCH!!!"
"@ninjavanish09 playing wow doesn't make you a nerd, i have 5  friends (not including myself) who all play wow (not all day, for a few hours a week) and we always go outside with each other. also i haven't read your entire argument, but from reading this one, you win simply because you said ""cuz wow suxx""? but the song is epic win, and those who disagree shall be hunted down by chuck norris."
"@ninjavanish09 isnt gay, ofcourse u got people that are adicted playing 24/7 stay awake bcus another wow comes out and that stuff....
but dont everyone is like that there are alots of people that play wow for like 1 or 2 hours every weekend"

"Meh, don't like the verses... but the Chorus kicks ass!"

"@ninjavanish09 God you are small minded... Because people play those games mean they don't go outside?

@moocow182462 LOL Yes
@marshtomp8 south park?xd
where have I heard this song before...I wish I could remember.
"@wickedmovies207 P.S. is latin for post scriptum, so P.P.S is post post scriptum, it can't be post scriptum scriptum. so it's P.P.S."

"@Bradatimrkonja 
I play video games a lot, I just recently broke up with my ex, but my social life is just fine. and I'm a hardcore gamer (gaming 4-8 hours a day)"
"@sodatree111 It's not all about girls, dude, I know this jerk who had lots of girlfriends(on a side note, he too thinks video games are for morons), and I know another, really nice guy, who's been going out with the same girl for a year and a half now(guess what, he plays video games -_-). In conclusion, playing video games moderately won't affect your social life+it's really fun :)"
I can shoot fireballs from my arse
"@sodatree111 Why does it matter if it doesn't exist? Isn't the point of a video game to HAVE FUN?

I think you misunderstand us gamers."
@sodatree111 U MAD BRO?????
haha im not even going to keep arguing with u little9-10th graders fuckin magic fireballs coming out of ur hands will never exist so stop hoping  it will its he most unrealist game ever u play this game to get away from ur problems in the RL because ur all little nerds i dont care i dont play video games and im in 11 grade step up im a master in kickboxing and Tia bow fucking scholarship to a baseball football and track colleges i get more girls then u see on ur little porn websites so get a lif
"@Xs4vi3r14 Well, the four I deleted because there were technical issues regarding posting, some posts were double posts, etc.

The rest were for the sake of argument."
@ThePieStoreGuy OMG you have sended mega many comments on this vid why is that? xD
I find it sad that most of the comments on this page are from me :(
I removed all those comments by the way because Youtube was screwing up. Don't know what the heck went wrong except that comments were showing up weird.
"@Cornampoo I agree that there are plenty of good games with small(er) (depending on how you want to define small), LOTRO, Team Fortress 2, etc. If you want I'll defend it with some links............."
"@ThePieStoreGuy I know what you're saying, but I don't agree with your deduction, that's all. You shouldn't defend the quality of a game by the number of players."
"@Cornampoo I see what you did there, but I believed you misinterpreted what I was trying to get at.

However, we're talking about a video game here. More players = Better game does it not?

People don't move en mass to bad games.

I'm not saying some games that aren't played but tons of people aren't good, I'm saying that games that have a lot of players are good games."
"@Cornampoo Simple: if many people do something, that doesn't mean it's good."
"And as you can probably guess, I do play WoW. Been playing for 3 years and I'm still playing in fact. Now, let us simply enjoy a good song and not belittle good games."
"@willem963 /yawn

Another statement with no supporting evidence."
@Cornampoo How does this pertain to my argument about how WoW is not a bad game?
I thought Live to Win was made just for that Wow clip in Southpark.  Awesome song :D
@ThePieStoreGuy: do you know how many people worldwide are addicted to drugs?
@sodatree111 no u
"@sodatree111 Yes, we need to grow up. You know what you're talking about."
"@sodatree111 Also, I think your making generalizations.................

Too many."
"@sodatree111 You know, you haven't said specifically WHY you hate WoW.............

Nor do you have ANY evidence backing your statement up.

And I'm not sounding tough. If however by sounding tough you mean forming coherent sentences that make sense, then yes, I am sounding ""tough""."
@sodatree111 I think it's trying to communicate!
hey u guys are fuckin idiots stop trying to sound fuckin tough over the god damn internet if i met and one of u little fuckers in the real life or the RL as u fuckin nerds wana put it id kill u then rape ur family fuckin WOW is gay get a life grow up play some 360 ps3 go outside for more then a day fuckin lets be fairys and shoot arrows and cast magic out of my hands .. grow up nerds go get out and get laid not by ur animals or ur sister eather and south park im not even say anything
"@sodatree111 You know, I hear that a game that has over 10 million subscribers (close to 12 million I would wage) must suck A LOT.

I mean really, any game that has that amount of people playing it must be a totally worthless game which is not even worth a second thought!"
@Critic863 Hi i'm hermershidamn

@TheOriginalNightHawk Live to die...Paul Stanley sucks!
@TheOriginalNightHawk you are a deusche.

"I fucking balled my eyes out to this song. I feel like it was written to me SPECIFICALLY towards me. Paul Stanley did an amazing job with this song. I live by this motto now, life's never going to be what you expect BUT if you fight your way threw it you CAN achieve your goals. Great video. I wish there was a MEGA thumbs up because this deserves it.

Awesome song! thanks for lyrics :)
"Haha. I was a WoW player...and Yeah it was HELLA addicting. I couldn't stop playing. But after I got a level 80 rogue and there wasn't really anything exciting to do anymore since I always got pwned in pvp by the people with full pvp gear, so I couldn't get my pvp gear. So then I quit. Although I'm thinking about going back.."
"wtf!? why is evryone talking about WoW and South Park. >_>
anyway... Great song! XD"
I agree. This video is flooded with South park comments!! even though i love South park :P
"games ( video games, kids games, bar games etc.) involve having fun, thus the word GAME, not being competitive and winning you fluff. But you wouldn't know that you WoW freak."
"and yet, you're still talking about video games in the comment section of a song that has nothing to do with video games ... computer games have nothing to do with living, ... or winning for that matter"
"I find it funny how people keep talking about WoW in the comment section of a song...Just because it was in the episode of South park where WoW was the main idea of the episode.
I love this song and i like to listen to it when i play video games,somehow when i listen to it,i manage to beat some harder levels in the game the ones i couldnt beat before.
So i like to call this song,a magical song...
XD"
"Best comment yet XD.
Thumbs up for people who dont know what is WoW.
(No sarcasm)"
yeah it was kind of the best sp episode ever^^ i watched it multiple times xD but the song is also great
"gl i played aion too it's maybe korean,but ik kick's ass=]"
"World of Warcraft sucked me in. :(

Now I cant help but putting in more then 5 hours in the game. Extremely addicting."
before you hate WOW play it. its pretty fun

I dont care if i pay for the game cuz its the most popular game in the world and there are like 8million players on the damn game, you should try WoW by yourself and check it... then tell what u think about it... its everyones opinion what they think about WoW"
"fair play, ive enver played WOW and ive never heard of it, but whos to say WOW or Runescape sucks? their both independant game which use startegy, sure WOW has better graphics, and thats a strength, as runescape has recent updates cheap price and ect. but the point im trying to make is why do we argue? theres no point and its very immature"

Welcome to the brotherhood of HELLO KITTY ISLAND ADVENTURE.
"A game is nota automaticlly ""good"" because you pay for it. We all think differently. Just look at Guild Wars. A great game, and you don't pay for it either."
lmao... WoW ownz a damn runescape... Runescape is for losers and poor people that cant afford a great game... stop talking trash about WoW cuz u just cant afford it and u dont know how to play the damn game idiot...
"""go to the store buy wow and join the online sesation before we all murder you """
"lol ur a loser trying to seem cool  u should have just stuck with   ""i like this song"""
hello kitty island adventure IS NOT GAY!!!!

"And it has been decided that Runescape licks 80 year old prostitute bum.

After a poop"
best song of 06 07 08

Runescape sucks. I don't play World of Warcraft either.
trop bien
"Pfft, WoW can take a stick and shove it in the oven. Rohan: Blood Feud is the way to go! :P

But seriously, everyone think differentely, it's up to you to decide what's good or not. No one else can do that for you."
"Except WoW is a good game, and Runescape is about as much fun as taking a dump after you ate a bunch of peppers and thorns."
"Graphics and animation matter little for getting addicted... Nonetheless Runescape sucks, but tbh I don't like WoW either XD Luckially tastes differ or life would be boring :P

Ow and to all people saying playing MMO's is a waste of time... going out and drinking beer is too then :) Sure it's fun but people find MMO's fun too, and neither of them is really going to help you with anything 'useful'."
"Me to, when i play a game.. and i hear this song, i play better xD"
This is the perfect song for WoW. :p
"wait wait wait. this song is for real?!?! I thought it was a made up south park song, like the Lemmiwinks song."
"Ah, such a cliche song. I kinda like it though, maybe because they used it in southpark."
i think this guy get more girls than you! don't forget it's an old KISS member!
good to listhen to when u play wow
Great song
This is the shit.
"Neonknight = frustrated(and lonely) , degraded(you are dumb) ,down before you're done , rejection (by girls) ,depression (you suck ass at life) ,can't get what you want (can't get any girls)"
So are you :(
"where i can download this song , please write =)"
"lol that episode was hilarious! the people sending mean comments remind me of ""wow, he must be one tough badass"". we should all agree on playing airsoft."
"Yeah Season 10 of South Park.... if I recall correctly it's episode 4.  The song is being played during the lvl grind sequence on the boars and while they are playing vigorously on the pc's in the school and also while Cartmen is  sitting on the toilet ready the WoW manual :D  Hope that helps.... and Kampinise (the person below me), there might be a reason it's only in text form instead of the actual video lol!!!!"
great song
i always play this video when i trying to acheive somit and i always pas its a good song for consentration
Ok... guys...so what if he plays World Of Warcraft and its his hobby does it really consearn you?
"Me? Eh me??
Why am i a geek? I have a hobby!
And 3/4 of the new generation has the same hobby as me!"
Thus song would be sooo cool to make my WoW PvP video with :)

Go to Southparkzone. They have all episodes.

kick ass song!
WOW kicks ass but u dnt like it cus u suck ass at it
this always help me do things very easily
i love this song it gets me so motivated!!!!
"Well said XD

I couldn't agree more, no matter what game, MMPORPG, FPS, whatever, this song boosts your hp by 1000."
This song is pretty bad ass. I listen to it everytime I am going to accomplish something (or trying to) on a video game. A tough boss battle? Play this song and you pwn that newb.
lol gw and wow r both great games but wow is made to be addictive and gw wasnt so if u play gw uve got less chance of losing ur life but wow owns =P
Yeah MAKE LOVE NOT WARCRAFT
"my dad took me to their final concert when i was like 4, it was great this was like the first song they played..i think, so imagine my pants-shittery when i went to the galleria mall in birmingham Alabama and saw them there."
Definitly and inspiration and my favorite song.
lol awsome! the lyrics kick ass!
oh yea!
i loved this song from when i first saw it in south park
"All things should be enjoyed in moderation and I don't think it's ""ridiculous"" to pay a monthly subscription that's equivalent to 1 cinema ticket with popcorn and coke, if you enjoy doing it."
i play wow i somehow agree in your opinion cuz i dont play as much as the other dudes...just log in a little each day only so you have a good point
"my persenal opinion is that wow ruins your life and kinda sucks (my opinian)
i got a friends that plays it and in 2months he lost all his friends inculuding me and doesnt came to party's anymore so my opinian 
wow ruinds your life
(if you play a lot)"
great song... never gets old
wow  ive got am 60 undead warrior twinked out
heh. your nice.
european servers
"yeah i know, i thought it was a fake song that parker and stone made."
Why can't we all just life for teh win and stop arguing?
sweet my COD 4 clan listens to this song b4 every match lol hit me up on xbl II KMACK II
i suppose that everyone got this song from the wow episode of south park
This song is great for World of Warcraft battle grounds (PVP) :) and CoD4 :)
"yeah but how u do it ? 
ipod is a great idea and i like this song !!!
it gives u power :P"
love this goes great with southpark wow episode
"Just shut up.  I dont care if its making fun of us WoWers, Yes i play, i have a 70 epic'd out Rogue as well, which means i play a lot.  But i listen to the song because it reminds me of the episode.  This song actually sucks anyways, I cant understand how people even liked it before South Park put it on their episode."
its NOT a wow song
"This song should be a rock anthem. Paul Stanley is one of the best singers ever, all categorys."
"It's not a WOW song, it was just played during that episode of south park."
YES YES!! A WORLD OF WARCRAFT SONG!!!
it's my song i like it :-) thank you man for upload :-)
"great song, awsome for grinding on world of wacraft"
I love Paul
a great morale booster song
would you make a vid of breaking benjamin-blow me away?:D i love it
Yeah! South Park - Make love not Warcraft! It ALWAYS reminds me of this :D
"its off WoW  so why use for a counter strike game ._.

to tell ya the truth im glad a song like this was made. everytime im depressed this song cheers me up completely. especially when i think of the south park episode with WOW. lol
i heard it in south park WOW episode it just pwnz :P
"Lol... I only just stumbled on this song. MY GOD IT'S FUCKING AWESOME! I'm gonna try sticking this on when I play CoD and shove myself all the way up to Major!

Lolz... the lyrics are perfect for depressives, artistic people and gamers."
how to unmark somebody as spam? I wanted to ask what is estemee and clicked spam :/
this song ROCKS
"hey. if you have a better life, you shouldnt be in youtube then. you should be out living your life you claim to have so much and leave us no lifers be lol"

(guitar solo)
<3 this song:P live to win!
damn inc banning the south park episode from youtube
cooooooooooool!
whahaahha i saw the same south park episode xD!!
"u say that as if only guys play those >:( besides, it's not nice to call people names and labeling them"
I totally agree with you
Just keep fighting 'till you fall ^^
"such a good song ruined by nerds and assholes posting completely irrelevent comments, pity isnt it."
i listin to this whenever i need to get pumped up
"ok, why the f--- was runescape and guild wars brought into the equation? oh yes thats why so you wouldnt argue about a ------- game which is irelevent whatsoever!! please guys, dont argue about which game is the best because from my point of view you are all total nerds, it has nothing to do with this song, nothing to do with the video, about 1min of music was used in that SP epidsode so shut up! and stop whining!"
the song is very good though.
"yeah, south park rules.they show that world of warcraft only makes addicts.world of warcraft is just an online game teenagers spend their time for homework on and then because of the stupid game they get bad grades, an even worse job and threw away their whole life."
oh yeah. *head bangin*
good lyrics for gamers
awsome song
"Pretty much. That game looks terrible, and has some of the worst generic gameplay I have ever seen. 
Seriously, it looks as if the game's graphics were made by scanning the designer's feces..
Of course, I am not much of a fan of WoW either. Looks fun, but too expensive for what amounts to a grindfest. 
I loved the WoW South Park Episode though. Probably my second favorite ep. 
I play Gekkeiju Online. It is a small game, but fun."
hell yeah. the world of warcraft south park episode song hehe. the lyrics to this song even fits for online games. thats how online gamers live their lives
awsome! 5/5
Proper* grammar and spelling.
"im not gonna lie, it sounds ALRIGHT, but only cuz' p. stanley is the man. its just too new age for me."
"sometimes you're trying living to win but some fucker one fucks you 'till you're completely lost. so you loose...

PAUL STANLEY ES UN CRACK!!!"
"1.rvsoldier2 learn your music man, this is ONE year old, not from the 80's you dumb shit.
2.This is NOT Kiss, this is paul Stanleys own band, which is just called Paul Stanley.
3. for all the people that dont know this.....ur really dumb like rvsoldier2..."
man i luv this song!!

its indeed a good song for rpg but also it discribed my life
"Real cool song! Paul rocks, even outside KISS."
"I agree with that statement, goes well with the concept of RPGs."

"This song = Guitar Hero 4.

"Haha.

But the same happened to me.
And now, that I found this song yesterday I feel way better, and also realize, that I have to move on.
