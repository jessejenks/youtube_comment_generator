Honestly at this point I'm not sure if goats actually scream like humans, but I'm too afraid to ask
It's like the original Pinocchio when the boys turned to donkeys
never do scream like humans cunts
I like two

i swear that second scream is in goat simulator
So that's why they never used actual screaming lambs in "silence of the lambs"
well this was my life 4 years ago
My mom came to my room because she though I was watching porn ...
That second one gets me everytime xD

The horrors they must've seen. If something as primitive as a goat can understand fear on a human level then they must've seen something. This is PTSD.

I remember when I was about 15,  I was staying at dad's place in a condo community and while trying to fall asleep, I heard an old woman yelling "Heelllp, Heellllp" and after 5th help I called out to my dad I think someone was hurt, his wife coldly shouted in a condescending tone "It's just a cat in heat".  Some animals definitely can sound human. That goat in the end of the video was tricking the dog even as it started dropping it's ears like it was being yelled at.
Lelelelelelelel
That one goat sounded like a human doing a goat impression lol
YEAAAH

sheep hits puberty and what do they have on their neck uh necktackles
It's like they are having a goat version of BSE or something.
Bruh
To me it sounds like the scream one would expect of a sentient lifeform very similar to ourselves that clips in and out of the verge of conscious self awareness of the fact that it is a goat trapped in a goat body
those forget their sounds
2:56 gets me all the time XD
the ending tho
1:25 Stone Cold Steve Goaten

2:01 is fake too...
1:15 again you can hear the same scream from 0:24...totally dubbed over
the one at 0:24 u can tell its fake..they cut out the original audio and bring in the fake audio..you can tell by there being no background noise all of a sudden
the last one is funny

Not trying to start a fight, but the second one is a sheep. Every goat screaming video has it, but it ain't a goat! It's a sheep :( Baa

It's should be try not to laugh
Gives new meaning to Silence of the Lambs....
These aren't goats there are people that look and sound like goats by magic
Animals are awakening faster than humanoids.

Humanoids don't understand at this moment. That good souls are teaching them the language of Angels.

Laugh of an animal and you are laughing of god, hence giving him good reason for teaching you not to laugh of innocent.

I will die on the cross if I have to. I won't let these animals suffer from your or their ignorance.

If you want to live in heaven on earth, better treat it right and respect the givers. The Takers will be forgiven, cause they were the strong and brave ones - not giving in to these pitiful Laws and Regulations of Society.

Society is only as strong as the weakest lead.

Satanists will soon break free of their illusion of Money (mon-eyed vision) And think Twice before acting.

Demons will no longer possess, but Support.

Angels will become stronger, faster, better and Bigger than they ever have been.

Keep close to the Sun, the holy ghost, the bringer of light and life and compassion.
0:24 - A great ringtone
It is done! Pan has imparted his infinite wisdom upon us!
be be ebe ebe...
Lol I still laugh at the dog's ears when the goat makes that noise. Dog's like, "What was that?"
the last one is real?????
The last one said "YEAHHHHHHHHH" 
lol
the one at 24 seconds is in goat parodie
Obvious they share human DNA.
the second one is the most famous
#9 is fake, right? I noticed because the background noise went mute and then went back on the moment the screaming stopped. Where did that sound originally come from? It's also on #5.
I was supposed to search heavy metal screaming but then I just had to go here XD
I'm fuckin dying
They say goats are at the low levels of astral plane... Ppl like hitler go there

My life is complete....
Someone put these goats out of their misery
I fricken lost it at 0:21 XD
"Goat scream" at 0:23 and 1:15 is fake. I have this scream sound effect in a licensed media collection.
Wtf 1:23 ?!? Lol!!!!!
0:23 Wahoooo!!!
and we thought goats went buuuuhrrrr
1:41 best pet 😂😂😂
Turns out, Goats, like humans, have a range of natural voices, which seems to depend on which part of the world they live in. Goats have accents!
Anyone came from K-391 or is it just me :)
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
The first one sounds like Pee-Wee Herman.
Boooooob?
The second one is probably fake, as the other audio cuts off during it
1:17-1:22...My ex-wife spoke goat, so I got the gist of what it was trying to express. It said, "What!!, you forgot to go by the store?!! (AHHHHHHHH)...you fuckin' loser shithead!! (AHHHHHHHHH)."
what the fuck am i doing with my life
Dick Cheney said 73% of goats were just re-incarnated humans... I think he was right.
That second one reminds me of Homer.
The fuck kinda humans do you know that yell like this?
1:41 sounds exactly like a Smoker from Left 4 Dead just before it attacks lol
LOL, 1:23 is the best one. The goat seems so offended! LOL
i LOVE the last one  :D
Funny stuff ☺😊😃😄😁😂😆
JAJAJAJA 0:25 muy comico

1:37 are undercover Raving Rabbids!!!
mmmmbheheheheheeeee :3 mmmm mmmm c': mmmmbheheheheheheeeee :p :o bheeeeee c:
Oooh, just goats... I thought it was Courtney Love singing.
To the uneducated Anti-Muslim brainwashed dumbasses. Here is Islam's and Prophet Muhammad's take on sex with animals (Bestiality):

Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas: "The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: If anyone has sexual intercourse with an animal, kill him and kill it along with him. I (Ikrimah) said: I asked him (Ibn Abbas): What offence can be attributed to the animal? He replied: I think he (the Prophet) disapproved of its flesh being eaten when such a thing had been done to it.  (Translation of Sunan Abu-Dawud, Book 38, Number 4449)
Jimmy Kimmel sent me!
I really hope there's a goat that can scream like Hacksaw Jim Duggan.
0:59 reminds me of CR7
Like if You came here from K-391.
Just made my day
yep... the voice doesn't match the face.
Have the lambs stopped screaming?
That second one screaming ! LOL! I can't stop laughing at this!
K-391 anyone?
K-391 made a song out of this lol
yeaaah
welp i watched this in school and then i watch it now what is going on with my life???
Not all of these are goats, they're also Suffolk and cross-bred sheep. Not all sheep are white and fluffy.
this is funny
You know what. It makes sense to me now.

No kidding religion believed goats were the symbol of the devil because of there frightening(yet hilarious) human sounding scream.
2:03 the dog just turned and probably looked at him/her thinking, "what have you brought in?" 😂
That's not creepy at all...
Yas
Aaaargh my tummy hurts...! - personal fav: The one around 1:37 where some goats "baaah" like they're supposed to, and then the overcoat one answers "RAAAAAAH!" like some kind of psycho. AAAahahahahahah-heheeheheeheeheheh...
What is the name of the video that the clip at 1:40 is from?
Did it really?
The goat from 1:42 - 1:58 sounded like a gas powered rc car

that last one. it's like yeah.
They scream like human !! I will never eat goat again !!!
1:13 that goat is me after school on fridays :3
The real reason why Goats scream like humans: the goat actually shrunk the humans down to the size of a mouse and swallowed them whole. Thus, when the goat opens his mouth, it is really the human screaming inside the goat.
LOL 0:21 Will Smith scream...
When u hear a goat make a sonic exe scream its game over.
Had me crying... Wtf
The dog at the end is like Wtf
1:41 killed me
1:23 was my favorite xD
Because why not argue with a goat.
It's weird to think that the world's most awkward animal is Satan's symbol. These creatures here are the devil's people.
0:21
funny
haahaha
Too many Muslim-Haters out there, were all humans!
maybe they're actually people who are now screaming in agony to be turned back.
There was an ad at the beginning of the video with the screaming goats about sprint apoligizing to verizon and atmt
Never not funny XD
Waffles
Moar movie previews plox.
What's funny is that so many humans think these are all goats...some are sheep.
Reasons why i want goat😂
If I didn't the source, I would have thought somebody just fell.
Is this evolution? Next thing we know, goats are gonna be talking to us...
Sometimes when people die they become goats. This is them calling out for help
They are reenacting the sound they hear when the MUSLIMS blow their load inside........

Reminds me of when Peter Griffin refuses to take back the monkey from the island because they wanted to teach it sign language to tell tales of their stay.

They eat them so the goat cannot tell...
😱 so sad. if only thay learned haw so Baca
Lol
1:37-1:43
That other goat was like " look at those two idiots "
and those two goats were like " SHUT THE F*CK UP "
I find the poor Shepherd's ears flattening at the end the funniest part hahaha

lolz the best one 1:40
I've seen this a thousand times
Even though I'm just a secretary, I've seen things most mortal beings won't, something above this world of ours. It all started when I was heading back home after work. I saw a human wearing a paladin armor, he was just sitting on the floor, petting a goat. When I got closer, he looked at me, and said: "Unown, you are the chosen one for this world." Before I could even respond, he and the goat disappeared. Needless to say, I was confused as hell. But it all made sense in my dreams. The Paladin along with the Goat of the New World appeared in front of me, they showed me the Goat. The enlightenment, the joy of playing Battletoads. That dream showed me what true happiness is. All they wanted in return was for me to be the prophet of this world, the one that will spread the word of the Goat to everyone. There is no heaven, there is no hell. There is only the Goat. Ever since that dream, my main duty in my mortal life is to be the Goat's prophet. My friends and family have already accepted the Goat, and soon this town and everywhere else will accept her as well. Just thinking about it makes me cry... but don't worry, I'm not sad. I'm happy.
Darude - Sandstorm.

Goats may be cute when they're little bit let me tell you they are DISGUSTING creatures. It's funny how pigs are stereo typed as the nasty one's. :P

I happen to own a goat. They poop eve-ry-where all the time. They smell horrible because they owe on thier beards to attract mates. And if you've heard that exsprestion "horny as a goat", it's true. All the animals that were living in our backyard with him ran away because they were tiered of being "used".
I cant even deal right now
"baa-aa-aa WAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUGGGHHH HELP ME I'M TRAPPED IN A GOAT'S BODY!!!"
i dont know if to laugh or cry, some of them dont look happy ( sorry my broken english)
Disney's Pinocchio had it all wrong... the boys go to Pleasure Island and become goats, not donkeys!!!
Yeaaah XD

1:23 - 1:36 is the funniest thing I've ever seen. It's like they're having a conversation and it's like "u wot m8?", especially the last time...
THE LAST ONE HOLY FUCK I CANT BREATH 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Some of these are lambs smh
Goat simulator 2014 in a nutshell.
I love this video I laugh every time I watch it
1:43 hahahaha they sounded like men
How did I end up here?
This is literally impossible to watch without laughing. Pure fucking comedy.
the dog at the very end was like "no way...he just broke the rules"
1:47 it's sounds like and old man
They must be humans reincarnated as goats...
I laughed so hard I cried.
I don't usually laugh very hard at all.
People please learn your farm animals!! The first one is 2 GOATS with man and woman. Second is a SHEEP! Third is a brown and white GOAT. Fourth is a brown GOAT. Fifth is a tan GOAT with white on his head. Sixth is a brown GOAT and black GOAT. Seventh is a SHEEP! Eighth is the interview with a GOAT. Ninth is 3 SHEEP in blankets! Tenth is a Goat. The very last one is a SHEEP!!!!!
Why? Why this video have 24 m views? lol
MOMMMM
Wahahahaha.
1:23 BEST!
2:01 Are you cool?
Putas Cabras están locas
this is where goat simulator comes in
How does a video with so much fake shit in it get such a high like/dislike ratio?
buuuuuuuuuuuuh!
The last one is so funny
I almost just went insane from the hilarity
FFFFFFFFuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyy
1:37 that scream is too human O_O
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark and hear the screaming of the goats.
Why...What would make such a creature emit such a horrible noise like this? The goat at 1:13 looks like he doesn't even know where or what he is anymore. What kind of fence is he behind? Is he in some kind of concentration camp for goats? God help them. Jesus save them. I pray everyday
Better than my video's! - I can't quite make out weither they're saying "Help!"  "Yeah! ", or if ther're shrieking with disgust as if being touched somewhere.
Wow...they're evolving so fast!!..watch out for goat

The last one is better than the rest
do you ever wonder if goats are the souls of people who went to hell and now have to serve time as a goat, so we're basically laughing at someone's call for help

like half life
some of these were edited with real voices.
That last goat tho
Hmmmm, am I the only one here who realizes that not all of the animals shown in this video are goats? There are a number of sheep too. Please simply update the video name to PART 2 of "Goats and Sheep Yelling Like Humans". I feel rather embarrassed for you otherwise.
these aren't actually goats they're humans that have been morphed into an animal by witchcraft they are crying for help to be noticed
Beeeehehehehe... AAAAAAGH!
1:52 Is that a Goatling ?
thes are elians not goats!!!!
2:01  yeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaah
most of these are fake
Goats. Goats Everywhere. They yell like we do. Are we now goats? Are goats now us? Just don't ever give the Goats an E. They wouldn't like it, and you wouldn't like it either...
2:01 "YEAHH"
that last pne though
Who's excited for Goat Simulator, these guys are lol
What if those goats. Were human once and they're just realizing they have been turned to goats
The very first goat was screaming like something or someone was raping it
1:38 is just the best one.
the last one is fake.
These are the goats you can play in Goat Simulator.
Those "wahooooo!!"s (like the second clip) sound fake. Can anyone confirm those are actually real? It's pretty hilarious.
Lmao :49 Bob! Bob! Bob!

Thats me yelling at my mom to take me to school
2:07 : LOL "YEAH"
Dat ending cad
ill save you all the trouble 1.13 loool
Read this entire message.....Place the thought of what it says into your mind and watch this video again and tell me if I'm wrong......about this:

Imagine for a second that when you die INSTEAD of going to HELL if you were bad in this lifetime, Imagine being immediately warped into the existence of a goat with all of your memories and human understanding intact but WITHOUT the ability to tell anybody or prove to anybody who you really are.....I bet this is what it would sound like
So I'm becoming more and more of a firm believer that in every single goat on earth is an actual human consciousness trapped and forced to live out one or many lifetimes (depending on how bad you were) as a goat. Getting sacrificed a few times....then attacked by a wolf another.......beat up by other goats who bullied you in real LIFE and recognized you as a goat.. 0:24 . "AAAsgghhhhhhhhaaah."......lol    The possibilities are endless.
yelling Goats are awesome...
Last one is fake. Sounds like Patrick Star
i got a few of these myself if you want some to compile again
ohhhhhhhhh  this made me laugh my ass off  made my fucking day lol
i love the last one'
2:00 DERP
2:01 YEAAAH
1:51 is the best haha
That German Shepherd at the end... Totally nonplussed. "Yeah, that's my pal the goat. He yells now and then. No big."
1:27 actually looks like a real person HAHAHAHAHA
It was funny when the goat said "yeah" at the very end.

One problem with this Video, several of the goats are SHEEP.
@1:52 and the one after = the beast  #goats
I think the disrespectful goat is the funniest, the one who spits in his face.
Imagine how freaky it would be if they had tongues shaped like human tongues. "Please don't eat me." A good question further; would we still eat them?

Thanks man,video had some issues loading so I thought I should check the comments.Saved my life!
I'm really in a bat HABIT checking videos like this out...

I think this is proof that all goats are just dressed up humans yelling and pretending to be goats.  This is what James Bond actually does for surveillance
that was cute:)
0:50 BOB!!!
youtube.com/watch?v=D8Ymd-OCucs&hd=1
The Last One Sounds Like Lorde's Song Tennis Courts
I think goats have evolved themselves to yell like humans for survival. So that when a human tries to kill them they yell like humans do so as to melt their heart.
Sounds like my roommate during his Crohn's disease.
Thanks!
01:30 i would most-likely be the goat

0:21 Segs, the best!
Wtf jajaja
last one said yeaaaaaaaah
Dafuq?
I think they actually were humans at some point, but some malevolent trickster god turned them into goats because they were cruel to a goat, or something. This is them screaming for help, or perhaps mercy, as they feel the last lingering threads of their humanity slipping away. All we do is say, "Haha, that goat sounds like a person," film them, and put them on YouTube, completely oblivious to their sanity-rending terror and agony.
i'm not sure about this being real or not, but i really want it to be real
Nah, it sounds like a man.
I, masturbated on that 5 minutes ago.... no regrets!

They're reincarnations from humans in previous lives. Occasionally they'll be shocked by realisations of what they've become and yell out for help.

Karma will even things for anyone in this life or the next :)
1:52 - I wonder what that goat has been thinking at that moment
1:40

Ehhhh 4/10 would still sacrifice to Lord of the Underworld.
1:42 THE BEES!!!!
que opina usted del gobierno de Zapatero: aaaaaarrrrrggggghhhhhhh xD
Firstly, I didn't say it for the sake of humour. If anyone or anything spits in my my face, I'm not gonna just stand there and take it. I sure as hell wouldn't let a person do it to me, so why should I find it acceptable for an animal to?

Secondly, again, you are getting way, way bent out of shape here.   "Go and eat your fucking mother?" Seriously? I made a comment about a goat, I repeat, A GOAT, and that's what you come to me  with? Not cool, man.
No wonder why stereotypical demon has goat horns.
It is no funny, it is insensitive. Go and eat your fucking mother.
Imagine if goats were carnivores, they could've used this method to wipe out humanity!
last one fake?!
Anytime bro.
Your comment made this video funny. Thank you.
What're you getting bent out of shape about? Is it your goat or something?
Fuck you
If a goat spat in my face like that, I'd be eating mutton for dinner that night.
00:21 either this is dubbed, or crazy af!! Hahah
Terrifying and hilarious at the same time.
I know that feel.
Does anyone else want a goat now?
1:22 is something straight out of Star Wars. The goat is a local shopkeeper in Mos Eisley, Tatooine and the guy is trying to barter with him, and the goat just spits in his face.
0:24 xD
I think those goats are broken
MOOOOOM!!! MOM!!! MOOOOOM!
this is probably what we sound like to them...they're just imitating us

You are very bonita!

Last goat: ...... YEAH ....
Lets kill them now
1:23 U MAD? :D

Most of the kiss born in the late 80's early 90's are spirit animals of goats. and the scottish, and poor black goat farmers, and the rich and elite are also a little goatlike( but they are able to afford horses ,too)
Somebody put some metal music over this

We had a goat at school that would yell too but it wasn't so loud (definitely not even  close to being as loud as the roosters and chickens) but it was so cute. Unfortunately some asshole parents came to the school and saw all the poop so we had to get rid of the animals. Animals shit, really you didn't know that?

I feel your pain. I have so much potential, too. We should start a support group.
If I owned a goat like that I wouldn't know whether to laugh or beat the shit out of it.
great clip, I didn't know goats could make these sounds.   Can I get a copy for a gag video I'm making at work?
The last one is actually a fake. Search the "yeah lamb".
Actually it is. the second goat screaming was just an audio clip of a screaming man dubbing the goat. the rest was real.
it fills me with such joy
What have I done?
1:38
...I can't even explain it.
The other goats have a regular sound and he's just like..
"GROWN MAN VOICE!"
is not fake

You are the man who stares at goats yelling.
The one at 1:14 gets me every time.

I'm displeased. My step-brother lives in the neighboring room and he over recent weeks got great at attracting females. He went to the Master Attraction website (Search in Google) by Jake Ayres. All he's doing now is banging women. He's always having the hottest women back and I hear it, which is gross. I wish he never discovered that site. My friend just signed up and got a blowjob a week later.
0:45 did he ever find bob?

Tortured souls are trapped in goats.
What am i doing with my life.
but they had goats and later I heard on the radio that goats can make that noise haha
I had to go to this farm once for a phone service call and me and my supervisor were presurveying the job and all of a sudden I heard screams.  They were far away but I thought they were coming from inside the house and I said to my supervisor "did you hear that? It sounds like someone is being tortured in there"...we never met with the owners, just checking something quick and took off but was like "maybe we should call the cops"
1:11-1: 21 my fav!!!

It frustrates me how people say this is fake! D: Even though goats rarely make 'screaming' sounds, unless they are super distressed---THEY DO! I promice!
This should be a test. If you don't laugh, you need antidepressants.
1:45 sounds like me when i have to go to school!
I want a goat for christmas
My classmates laughed when I told them I would get rid of fat with Trim Fat Maximizer, but then they saw the results. Google Trim Fat Maximizer to see their reaction. (You should see their faces!)

0:30  You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?
i have a physics lab due tomorrow. what the fuck am i doing here
These aren't actually goats. These are people who have been trapped in the bodies of goats as  a punishment for liking Justin Beiber.
go home, you're drunk
Your comment makes you stupid.
LMFAO @1:15 1:20 1:24 1:40
The German Shepard at 2:03.   He's all like...wtf?
Lol
Lol
omg, that last one seriously cannot be real. if it is, where can i buy a goat like that?
I can't fucking wait til I'm a goat then - what a life. You get to walk around naked, eat shit and scream and people love you.
1:25 ''Bitch out of my face !''
WATCH MY GOATS PEOPLE ;) /watch?v=yE7P-vvPBvU
Nothing like this xDD
These are amazing, but they would be better if they weren't filmed with potatoes
the goat at 1:23 is a fucking menace
it is
that last one can't be real
Yaa
I love the last one
0:45 MUM!!!!!!!
0:23 that goat is my favourite one :D
That last one has to be fake

What emberhair wrote was creeping as hell because thats what I feeling
Yeeeaah lol
1:24 is when i lost it
Yeah
HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
hahahahahahahahaahaaaaaaaaaaahaahaahaahahaahaaaaah
Clearly, these goats are the human sinners of god transformed into goats who are screaming for salvation from their everlasting torment.
Fucking sick tune
What if when we die we are reborn as goats, and this is merely our grandparents trying to communicate?
I lost it at 0:57
if you say so...
chequen este video /watch?v=PpccpglnNf0
0:43 bob!!!!
I'm done trying to talk to you.  Oh and I wasn't talking smack.
you're so smart, you should know what im talking about. 2nd of all, you replied to MY question so.. 3rd, you didnt even have a question. you were talking smack the whole time.
1:24 what the fuck is that goat's problem?!
Maybe you should be a little more specific.  But how you're talking it sounds like it. But you didn't answer my question about the other guy, go bug someone else.
thats not what i meant, "hating on someone" is what i was talking about
A comeback means the art of replying to an insult with a witty word, statement or sentence.
what??? did you hear yourself? do you kow what that even means?
Nice come back.  Why are you hating on me instead of the guy who said RIP english?
lmbo  you guys  crack me up. If you understand it you shouldnt even care. and im not reading that whole essay speech of your complaint. i read the last sentence and your overeacting big-time. what are gonna do "press charges" or "sue me".
makes you look stupid
LMAOOO@ 1:25
At 1:25 the man is actually asking the animal what he thinks of a certain politician
That's not even hypocritical. But why do we care if we understand it?
Language exists for understanding. For communicating with others. Were I to speak Greek, you would stare at me with a look of confusion much as I looked at my monitor with confusion upon seeing your original comment.
If you wish to speak a language, don't speak it in chopped up, twisted versions. SOME variations are okay like "ur" online, but not that twisted Devil Tongue you spoke.
What's wrong with being a hippocrite
why were there sheep?
evolution!! they started doing this so people wont f them anymore..
My face hurts from laughing soo hard!! I'm legit crying right now. LOLOL
I like tthe last goat so much!!!! XD
whose business are you minding?
That 2nd goat can scream like homer
What am I doing with my life...
Man, people argue about goats now?! Are you not watching this?! Lol
1:23 XD
What are you trying to prove?!
The last one was funny I'm on floor crying
Good translation lol
why do you care if you understand it?
your're so smart cuz you know its english, not smart enough to notice you understand it though?
hippocrite
The last goat made me lol
1:24 a "fuck you" spit on the face goat-" SHUT THE FUCK UP
guy-"why do you have to be such a dick?"

guy-"but"

LMAO 0:24 sounds like will smith in fresh prince of bel air
Neither do you it seems
no one cares about your goats.
They forgot how to goat.
Yes I heard that to but figure hay..they are closely related but goats are way smarter.I have read that some studies have matched their intelligence with dogs. Nigerian Dwarves are even smarter and bond with you.  They get jealous for your attention and touch.  They love getting scratched on the back.  Most places allow Dwarves as pets.  They are cleaner than dogs. We have one that jumped a 6 foot fence with the help of a 4 foot house...but 6 feet down the other side!!..just to get in with us.
Yes.  I have been raising goats for years and  I still freak out and think a human is screaming sometimes. Their voice box is similar to ours. They are remarkable creatures. Goats were likely domesticated thousands of years ago along with dogs. Certain Dogs are very protective and gentle with goats.  We have a mini horse right now and he runs the heard and is a great security guard.He really thinks of them as his heard, keeps them in the pen at night and gets pissed off when there is a threat.
We raise goats and I sleep in a music studio located smack in the middle of their yard.  Every morning they wake me up by beating on the out side walls..every one..and we have 20 right now... all know their names and will answer you accordingly.  I say "Hi Ivory" and Ivory answers back.  I say "hi peanut" and peanut answers back. They all have a distinct voice.  I can tell you who it is with my eyes blind folded.  They are very loving gentle and funny creatures.
ROFLMAO 2:00
1:24
Do people actually think this is real ??? lmfao
Omg this is just fucked up i laughed so hard lmfaooo!
0:22 & 1:16, that's not a goat...they mixed in a bit of sheep screaming

And what about humans singing like goats? Funny song at YT ... /watch?v=jzJb9IozKSU
Andy Murray must be interested in goats - Scotish heritage; or was he thinking about PseudoFed.
A-men to that, I say
2:00 okay billy, so did you take the cookie?

This can't be real..lol

Some of them sound like they're yelling for help
I'm laughing so hard that my guts are flying out of me!
That last goat XD "yeeeeaaaah"
I just subscribed hilarious
Too funny my face hurts from laughing. I look forward to seeing that grumpy goat on more political debates.
He's saying: what do you think of the Zapatero administration (former president of Spain)?

This is funny, don't matter how many times you watch it hah!
You cannot *yell
Silly goat. You cannot laugh. You are not human........ so they said
what if theres a curse that turns men into goats and the only way they can actually speak is screaming o.O
yeah if you have double dropped acid!!!!
1:15 is a sheep, not a goat...I think

1:25 OHHH Goat: 1- Guy: 0
I'm pretty sure the scream ones are fake, they're all the same sound. The "Yeah" one seems unrealistic too. It's too small to have that low of a voice. Also, some of them are sheep ;)

In Africa they believe people can turn themselves into goats. a group of villagers had the police arrest a goat claiming a witch doctor who had just robbed them had morphed into a goat in order to escape... so... yeah... >_> maybe?? lol

The best ones are the ones with multiple normal sounding goats...and then there's that one
I love the last goat
Virgin and mentally retarded.
of course it has to be a black sheep yelling 'YEAH' at the end...
Thats me When i'm bored 2:00
I know how to use the word! Thanks for your concern though! It was an exaggeration. In other words it was really funny!
I love goatsssss!!!!
LOLZ LIKE I'M NOT LYING I ACTUALLY LOL'ED
AND AT TE END IT WAS SO CUTE BUT WIERD
1:39 - Boondock Goats.
last goat is black and has a deep voice saying yeeea wtf
What a majestic creature
All the neighbors probably think people are being murdered XD
I'm betting you probably didn't "literally" laugh your ass off. Learn how to use the word!
What are you talking about?
Please excuse his mental illness. Martin Bott (wwwtotalitaerde) is suffering from a psychosis that makes him believe the government is after him, controlling minds everywhere etc. >_> His allegedly murdered brother even went to court against him because he didn’t want him to use his name for that nonsense. Now he sticks to defaming my country in Youtube videos. He’s a madman and wants to make his shitty conspiracy-homepage look important.

Info:

3x "w" superiorman DOT de SLASH MartinBott.doc
go away
Fake and gay.
Brilliant vid so funny :-D
2:00 YEEEAAAAHHHHH
1:23 wtf
1:24 is the best it's like 
men who is speaking:this is a beautiful goat!
goat:(sneezes on him) 
for me that means the goat meant to shut up the men.
Kuaaaajajajajajaj me meoooo!!!!
Check out my channel and homepage. I found an official report from 1944 where a US pilot reported being attacked with radiation weapons inducing currents into the ignition and electrical system of his aircraft. This happened near Frankfurt. Thats the first confirmed report on open military use of directed energy. The earliest use for torture was in 1908, see chapter Psychiatrie-->Klinik der Narkolepsie on my homepage.My brother Markus Bott had been tortured and murdered to shut down our homepage
1:36 Cover up the video. Could be a man argueing with his wife
1:23 hahahahahahahahahaha
*together* WHAAAAAAAAAAAHH!!! :D
the last one omg
1:20 "MOOOOOM" sounds like it´s calling his mother :D
I fucking lost it at 1:25. Brilliant!
Help i forgot how to goat
sounds like the one at 0:51 is yelling mom!
THIS CUTE ;D
LOL
First, goats become viral for fainting, and now, they're viral for screaming.
I think they might be trying to warn us that something TERRIBLE is about to happen.
because that one's a voice over. most of the rest are real
that's deep. Lol.
***WARNING** DONT watch this while you are studying for finals in the library. People will simply scream at you for laughing too loud.....you have been warned....
เชี้ยไร หว่านิ เสียงยังกับควายถุกเชือด
Yeeeeeaaaaaaah.
i think i heard a goat saying godegoge at 1:53
You keep using that word, but I don't think you know what it means.
uauuuu! noaptea mintii!
WWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!
Sounds like they're saying mom! By the way I literaly laughed my ass of watching this!
The second one was definitely the best lol.
1:23 was the funniest thing ever
They have a future in making foley noises for movies.
The Wilhelm Scream is certainly popular, but these goats have character.
Frankly we need some more "Scream Sound Libraries" to pad out many of our movie entertainment needs and these goats could fill up a number of suitable scream audio files to be sold as a package.
2:00 homer simpson
0:42-1:12 sounds like a black guy getting raped
0:25
Just for clarity, a number of these are sheep, and yes they do  make these sounds and more... so much more! LOL
I want 1:45 for a pet. He is adorable. The pathetic goat at 29 kills me too. He is hilarious. He is broken, for sure. Or he needs new batteries.

he said "Sapataro, what is your opinion, Sapataro?" The goat spits him and he says "he's better then me" and something about a channel. He then says "from the Island of Eukaliptis" or something like that. I don't really understand what he is saying but he was probably on air at that time.

After that, he is asking the goat about Canary Islands Government, which is the place where it was made the "interview" xD
1:17 jar jar binks

I think the goat at 0:21 wants to let us know he just found out that his balls were removed...
best one 1:22!
I was watching Cry. How did I get here?
2:02 YEEEEEAH!
1:37 - Best one by far.
He is asking the goat what he thinks of our old Spanish president, obviously the goat tells him that he was the worst we had in our modern history.
The dog in the end of the last one xD
there are not just goats, but sheeps too. but really adorable video ^^
He speaks Spanish and they are talking about politics and the awful economical situation in Spain. It is a very interesting and wise conversation in fact XD. It summarizes everything!

Lol, 2:02, the dog is just like
"What just happened?!"
0:43 "BOB! BOB! BOB!!" guess he hasn't found Bob yet.
Well done captain obvious.
He was making a joke...
0:28 HAH GAAY
It's obvious they're people that were trapped in goats and they're screaming for help.
I love GOATS!  but now you can see why I got rid of the two I had as a teenager! they woke me at daylight !! ;)
YEEAAHHH

1:53 oh my god thats frickin adorable

2:02- Goat: "Yeah"
       - Dog: "WTF?"

When you're down ... and weary - watch goats yelling like humans.

Who knows why it is just so freaking hilarious :-D
1:45 sounds like Steve Carell!
LOL Right at 1:24 hahaha can't stop replaying! :D

Then be prepared for the poop machine, no joke their like a chain gun!(ewww)
1:33 is the best.
that last one made me cry a little.
1:39 gets me every time.
1:23 XD
That goat sounds like an old man at 1:33. Maybe he turned into a goat after he died?
this video is WONDERFUL
1:24 omg :D i cant.. :D
Thousands of years of evolution and we're sitting here and entertain ourselves with the goats...=_)
2:01 YEAH !

It's becoming popular now though.
1:37 is the best
the high-pitch screaming ones are mega fake though
Good point. Personally, I still think it's fake. But whatever.  People believe what they want either way.
Did you know that goats actually have regional dialects and accents like people do?  It is true!
My neighbor and the kids would sound like babies and the adults would sound like full grown men. Some days you would think he was running some sort of torture chamber over there.
I like the last 5
hahaha! Oh my god, that last one xD

Ah. It would appear you are correct. However, some noises my goats make are pretty odd, haha
maybe some of it, but i think most of it is real
@Diana Palmer Yeeah, you keep telling yourself that and, maybe it will come true.
this is better then harlem shake
It sounds like Steve Carrell doesn't it?
this is better than harlem shake
1:43 is the best!
NOW IM LYING IN THE COLD HARD HAY MEEEEEEH
0:43-53 Baaaaah-b oh baaaaah-b
The second to last one sounded like an old guy falling down a flight of stairs.
I think that 1:37 is better
My favorite part was 0:54
"YEAH"

So funny! Shame the second goat is totally busted as fake.
1:40 sounds like 2 bros
LMFAO!!!!!
Noosssa mto legaau adoreei :D
Thats very cool! But it´s not very strange; espicialy goats have very strange voices and sounds often like screaming people when they bleats. The worst is that once they have begun, it takes a very long time before they stop...
That screaming lady one seems faked. There are unnatural stops in the sound.
Now I understand why goats are traditionally portrayed as Satan's creatures. Metal as fuck.
Did anyone else feel the urge to buy a goat after this?
I lose my shit at 1:40
That's how it all started with the screaming goats songs THUNBS UP
Maybe they just wanna see their meathook friends again ...
Awsome ending
its a frigging sheep
Are they all calling for their friend Bill?
At 1:41 I thought that goat had 2 heads.
You were retarded from the start.
1:04 :') cutest thing in this freakin world.
Omg I was busting up through the whole thing xD And that last goat...oh wow SO unexpected! Lmao!
This never gets old!!
WTF XD
Im on the weird side of YouTube again
they re yelling "HELP!" :-(
lol....he's like wtf was that?
2:00 that dog is like "Where did that come from? It couldnt have been that thing.."
Fake or not, the second one has me in tears.
*Goat yells* Yo, I think it's got terets.
reincarnation gone wrong lol
poor goats they were once human
0:24 wtf a goat can yell like that?!?!
I'm in tears right now. Can I work on a goat farm?
The second one is fake... I used the same sound  effect on a video....
LMAOOOOO
LOL oh my sides

Dave Grohl brought me here!  (SXSW) 2013 Keynote Speech

Damn...I was hoping you were :(

Hell yeah!!!
Finebros brought me here!
I agree ;)
in 'youtubers react' you can see that the second goat is also fake.. just a sound effect ;)
I guess this is funny to someone who has never been around goats.  But having lived with a herd of 30 for awhile, this is normal behavior for them.
only the last one.... ever actually seen a goat?
3/4 of these are fake...
Grohl sent me.

What the fuck is wrong with these goats!
Er, they ain't all goats, I saw some sheep and some type of ox or cow in the mix. I'd recognize sheep as I'm a shepherdess, and I have a goat for milking. But it is interesting to see, I'll give ya that.

natural selection will favor goats with human like bleats because they'll have less chance to be slaughtered by humans for meat because of the sympathy  :P

The last one makes me lose it. "Yeahhhhh" while the dog is silently freaking out.
I am serious, I'm literally crying of laughter best fun for years.
Now my throat is sore
hahahah i almost pissed myself that was so funny!
1:13 is fake as hell. It has the same exact scream as the original screaming goat and look at how the freaking camera is all set up in HD. Bullshit. Or should I say goatshit.
1:23 was hilarious though.

made my day already:D
the absolutely best at 1:40!! :D
1:25 i'd punch that fucker in the face!
yyeeeeeeeaaaaaaaa
Haven't laughed so hard in such a long time!!!!!!
Geez! More than two goats seem to have an obsession with Bob :D Who is this Bob guy anyways? Bob the Builder??
I watched this today at Japanese everyone was laughing so hard after we all finished the class ned door came over and we were in complete silence
check this out - /watch?v=x1W9gE18o6o
I laughed so hard I got tears haha!
To all the people saying "THESE ARE ALL FAKE!!!!!" some of them might be, but the majority of them aren't.
I guess this happens after too many goats got screwed by farmers :<
He actually was not saying anything wrong, he was asking for his thoughts on the government lol
I could watch this all day
most of these are so fake that it hurts..
they all sound so crazy
1:44 sounds like it has burned its tongue
He was talking about Zapatero's administration in Spain, so yeah, basically something vulgar.
NASA needs to include this on exploration satellites. If there is life on anther planet, they really should see this.
1:47 the goat sound mentally retarded!! lol rofl
first man to ever argue with a goat 1:24
that last goat was on steroids
"yeaah"
is this real? how is this real?
2:01 .... come on really? lol
0:44 sounds like he's screaming "MOM"!!!!!!!!
ههههههههههههههههههههههه اه يابطني
hhhhhhhhhhhh lool
Satan!
YEEAAAAH
I am convinced that a human was turned into a goat and can talk
If we just could teach them to yell help we could do some great stuff.
Great video.
you're a creepy muthafucka
Not trying to send any kind of message here, but most North Americans don't know that this is what a goat sounds like when you slit its throat. But it's a common way of killing them for their meat.

(I'm Mexican-American and I've had uncles slaughter goats like that. And for me it was pretty traumatizing.)
2:03 YEAH lol!
The one at 1:20 reminds me of Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove
1:24 i can't breathe
1:26 Is clearly saying, 'wha?' Not an Spanish speaking animal then.
0:25 was definitely my favorite
if you listen to the second to last one it sounds like a dirtbike... O_O
This is photoshopped. I can tell because I can hear the pixels.
2:00 LMFAO!!!!!!!! :)
MOST OF THESE ARE FAKE!!
The goat and the man had conflicting points of view on politics at 1:23 lol
The derpy one at the end was funny
xD the goat would have so beat up the man if he could get out his cage
Ok the ones that look kinda shaved with the long necks and no horns, they have that kind of high pitched scream that sounds just like me when I scream. Is that real? It kind of sounds like someone inserted the audio on that one.
Dammit Zoey...
Lots of these are definitely fake
1:23 is definitely the best.
I forgot how to goat lol
1:45; he's so awesome. He's like a scared little boy
THE LAST ONE. OMG
1:15 super drool
1:16 then the dance!
0:29 Wingardium Leviosaaaaaahh
HAHAHA
xoaoxaoxaoxaxoaxax aoxoaixaxa
1:23 bahahaha i think i died a little ^.^
1:23 , the face of indignation... ahahaha
Good observation Sherlock..
The one at 1:24, he was asking the goat what does she think about Zapatero´s goberment (Spain's expresident).... I get why the goat acted like that.
a bunch of these are fake
1:16 that looks more like a sheep
1:14 that goat reminds me to eddy murphy
1:23 What???? What??? What??? What??
1:38
I forgot how to goat
1:43  "Too much habanero"
and this is the secret to how goats lure humans into their traps.. and eat them as a bloodthirsty hoard of screaming demons....
the most majestic little sits ever
1:23 wtf :D
0:22 and 1:15 are sheep....dumbass
this is horrible.
LMAO!
These are hilarious except a few after the first screaming one and the second white screaming one could have definitely been edited out..
the last one !!! :DDD
I could almost agree with you but half of them don't look like they're "trapped" at all so...
The screaming ones are fake. Especially the first one. You can tell it's been dubbed over. Stupid
1:23 was fking hilarous haha
0:43 BOB! BOB!
 I wonder if he ever found Bob?
ha
All except the last one of course...
The dogs reaction at the last goat is priceless. xD
The last one!! and the second one and the one where a goat is arguing with the human... make me LOL!
Yet they sound better than most singers today,,,
These goats have a throat infection or something?
they are screaming "HELP!" yet we find it funny. . . LOL
I lol'd at 0:26
1:44 this is the best one :D
German Shepherd: uhh. Did u hear that?
Goat sound like frat boys.
Translation of all the goats: CATHERINE!!!

Like a BOSS
This isn't dubbed, right?  These animals are actually making these noises?
I was looking for Justin Beiber...and this is what I found.

The goat that spat in the guys face sounded intelligent almost
Lmao the last one is too much <3
That last one man, all the other ones are funny don't get me wrong, but that last one, always takes the wind out of me.
:43 sounds like it's yelling "MUUUUM!!"  hahahaha had me dying

Damn kids.

Now that you put it that way, it doesn't seem so bad.

So this is what my life has come to. Watching videos of goats scream like people.
Abraham Close this is the noise your mom makes
0:24 EPIC!!
funny!
Lol at the one at the end. "yeaaaaah"
I completely lost it at the last one
:55 and 1:37 are the funniest. I can't stop laughing. You can tell this isn't fake because you can see their ears go back shaking as they're screaming.

@officiallyawakened  you sound fucking crazy. I sincerely hope you're joking because if youre not, someone should commit it
*Spit*
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
The 3rd Goat looks like Jimmy Kimmel!
AAAHHH!!!
"What can I do for you" haha very cool.
I just found the OP for all the ones I though were fake, and they are.  @AjQ2891 has four videos, and the last one's not in this compilation, probably because it's not believable at all.
And they proceed to have an argument xD
The sheep at 0:23 and the one at 1:15 have the same scream.  Probably fake.
1:40 Statler and Waldorf as goats
you're a bloody idiot
1:23 is the BEST goat clip ever
Ok.....scariest shit ive ever seen. Background knowledge: scientists have been putting human stem cells in goats, and other animals, and now theyre screaming like humans. Theyre also being born everywhere with human faces. Just holy shit dude! This is not funny. This is a fucking wake up call!
lmao the dogs face in that last clip
They're cute AND delicious...?
Seriously though, if you'd eaten goats, you would never ask why people eat goats. They're sooooo tasty.
After 10 straight hours of watching goat videos, it begins to get a little creepy ... but the one at the end ALWAYS makes me laugh.
ahhaha wtf
best in the world
1:23 HILLARIOUS
aint nobody got time for spanish
حشيش
Последний козёл самый лучший!
А чё нормально так!!!
There's so cute, how can you eat these guys?
Is there a goat edition of this video?
HAHA!SO　FUNNY
0.28 ♥♥♥♥♥
last is best YEAH
GOATS are GOAT
1:23 is a great metaphor for an average internet argument. The man represents anyone trying to reason their point of view, and the goat represents your average dipshit.
the goat at 0:23 feels fake. By that I mean listen to the sound. You hear all this noise going on in the back then it just kind of dims and then cuts out right when the scream is about to happen. It then goes back to normal sound. I think someone dubbed an actual scream over the video of the goat.
The screams from hell right here
The last one omg too funny!!
0:23 gets me every time.
WAAAARGH!
from :43-:53 sounds like its yelling mom
has anyone thought that maybe the goats are actually humans stuck inside a goat's body........
Whats more is the argument that ensues after he spits in his face haha.
yeas, me thanks your ;)
I feel so bad for them
00:27 that one makes me burst in tears laughing so hard hahahah
I am laughing so hard right now
1:36 gave me nightmares!!!! It's so creepy how they yell
0:28 Professor McGonagall has transformed into a goat...

You WILL die at 0:23!
SKDHFOTSSTSYCKVPXTZOTZOYXJOXITZ
i think the one at 1:44 is the best, to me it sounds like a retard goat LOL
The last one makes me laugh so hard XD
These are not all goats.  4 of them are sheep.  IJS
The conversation at 1:23 is very similar to riding public transit in Los Angeles.
1:23 I WANNA BE IN THE SHOT TO SO STFU
1:23 *spits in face* YOU LIEN TO ME YOU MADE HUMP U AND THIS IS THE SOUND I MADE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Thts sum funny shit!!! Lol
1:23 LMFAO!!!! Spits in his face then yells LMAO!!
lol at the two fatass goats
The last one HAS to be fake.
"AHHHHHHH, they've turned me into a goat!"
Why am I doing this... I have stuff to do!
What if all of these are just voice overs and some guy pulled an ultimate troll? We had a debate on this in health class today haha
tears are a rolling!! damn that was funny!!
lmaolmaolmao礼貌礼貌礼貌
This shit is funny.
1:21 -Qué opina usted del gobierno de Zapatero?

Horrible creatures, sound like screaming devils! Now I understand why the Bible said that at the end of the world, God will separate the goats (screaming devils) from the sheep (peaceful angels) !
:50 sounds like a person yelling "baa" even though it's not!

My fave two was the one tht spit in the guys face (lol!!) and the one at the end :'D
This is my new favorite thing. Like seriously, I could watch this a thousand and twelve times and still laugh at it.
God certainly has a sense of humor.
The guy speaking spanish? Or the goat? Either way, neither of them sound like Steve Carrell.
Why the fuck does someone take a goat in their house?
1:24 HAS to be Steve Carrell doing a voice over. No way. Hahahahaha

The lay one is too funny
I love the spit one it killes me!
Listen, if you been around goats at all, there is always that one goat that makes the human sounds. Mostly what I have heard are the ones that sound like babies crying, but these are too funny. Yep, I don't think it's evolution, it's just them, and they are loveable and unpredictable animals, cause you never know how they gonna act.
Rofl
The second last one sounded as if it had burnt its tounge! Lol so funny!
That last one thoo
0:22 don't scream at me! You ain't my dad! D:<
1:23 walka na beszty :D
Absolutely genius! Completely lost it at 1.40
When did goats start screaming like humans?  This is news to me.  Evolution baby!
The silence of the goats
So funny.
third one: dying Medic
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
They are slowly learning to communicate through sounds lol and here we are laughing
1:17 Gave me a heart attack.
MMMMYEEEEEEAAAAHHHH-last goat had me crying
The second one was totally dubbed.
When the man was talking the goat was saying "What?"
Well, for one thing I work with samples a lot, and I kan recognize a sample coming in twice when I hear one. The exact same sound is played three times in this video, so it's fake. Some of the sounds sound exactly like hormoneexploding teenagers screaming their heads off, but yes I know goats can scream in funny ways too.
goat at 1:24 dosen't like that guy lol
Whats wrong with these goats. Fricken hilarious :D
Yeeeaaah!
hahahahhaha 1:23
1:22 was priceless.
Challenge accepted.

The guy asked the goat what he could do for him

Yeah
YEAH
...wat
I just went to the shops to get some crisps. I've got a dirty hangover. I also went into the bookies to put a bet down, the old man behind the counter asked me if I was alright and acting purely for my own satisfaction I told him to go fuck himself. The feeling of anger was born out of my suffering;  if I suffer then I want you to suffer.  He still processed my bets though and if they come in and I win I'm going to take the money and spend it on crack cocaine and get nutted.
Holy fuck
End: yeah...

1:27 the goat tries interrupting him, but nope.
these arent dubs are they? lmfao
The goat at 1:43 has down-syndrome.
I can't believe that goat spits in his face.
Just hear me out on this. What if goats yell like this to warn humans of a catastrophic event in the future. We're laughing but they're serious about this. At 1:24 the goat got so fed up with the human that he spat on him. "WHHAAAAAAT? FUCK IT!" I now have a greater respect for goats.
Maybe human souls are stuck in the goats body.
1:30 OMFG LMFAO
2:00 - "YEEEEAH" Goat.
With that Sharingan? Not for long.
Am I the only one who thinks that the last goat is the best? XD

Goats: as voiced by eddie murphy
I'm so glad I came here
I come here when I'm sad. I'm not sad for long.
Not all of them are real.
Haha stupid.
Love how the sheep bleats and then the goats scream.
XD
Lost it at 1:22
I feel like the first sheep is saying, "Ellen! Ellen! Ellennn!"
I don't know what's more creepy at the end: the way the goat says "yeah", or that stare that dog is giving
Are these all real?

That's deep.
Help, I've fallen and can't get up..the laughing, it hurts.
what if when we die, our souls get trapped in goats and all we can do is scream but no one helps us because they think its funny
So culturally, we have gone from cats falling into toilets to screaming goats. Can we go any lower?

I say yes, bring it on.
lol the 2:00 one
Some of these are sheep, not goats.  The sheep are at 0:21, 1:13, 1:37, and 2:00.  Trust me, I raise both sheep and goats, I can tell the difference between the two.
OMG this kills me
omg my heart literally jumped.

Hahahhahha loll
AHAHAHAHAHHAHA :,)
I cant stop laughing at the goats at 0:25 and 1:25
Most are real clips but 0:26, 1:16 & 1:20 are just fake audio. I'm a bit suspicious about 1:41 and the last one too. :)
oh my goat!
Holy mother of god, 1:40 has obliterated my sides
0:04 Just two people taking their goats on a leisurely stroll through the city XD
Lol at 1:22 and the the dog at 2:01.

0:22 = First time Spiderman is jumping from an building, like: Yiiiiiiiihhhuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!
1:25 is so funny :L
Leave the poor goats alone.. all they want is to connect with us. Sometimes it just takes more than screaming like a human to be a human. I'm talking to you Bieber.
Some of these are actually sheep, but I'm just nitpicking....hilarious

1:17 because he is slimey
1:17 because he is slimey :D
1:24 is the best spot in the video. The man arguing with the grumpy old goat who spit on him is hilarious! XD
Watching in class and everyone died at 0:24. Someone fell off their chair :D
Omfg! That was hilarious!!
@TheEdik1020 Yes you are the only one who thinks that. Put the paint thinner and rag away.
0:56 Ohhh shith justin biber! I yell to get rit off him!
No goats, only humans can use their vocal chords like that
Lmfao at 1:23 reminded me of the cookie monster
I died at the end!
They call their mom.
Love the guy who says, "yeah" at the end!
2:01 best!!
Best 2 minutes of my life =)
0:45 HEEELLP !
I thought about it, but that's where religion fails, as soon as I started to think.
am i the only one here who thinks that these goats have a soul of a human who died and god gave him to be a goat so they are yelling for help or to god ? O_0 really think of it
fucking hilarious
1:12 is the best, lol.
1:23 A typical conversation with my girlfriend.
OMG ahahahahahahhaaa
Thats weird, jesus brought me here.
:49 MOOOOOOM! MOOOM

The first one sounds like a Michael Jackson scream lol.
Letzte Fake, vorletzte goil! :-D
1:15 lol
Second last one sounds like Larry David
Not funny dude. 0:44 was actually a rescue party looking for a guy named Bob.
Can't you hear the grief in the goats voice? "BOOOOooOOOOB"
1:41
1:24
omg, i peed my pants
0:56 started out so normal then killed me. i literally fell out of my chair
fake
I don't understand how you can dislike this video. It's so great.
I SERIOUSLY CAN'T BREATHE. MY SIDES HURT AND MY THROAT IS GETTING RASPY. I LOVE THE FEELING OF DYING OF LAUGHTER
1:45 - Jerry Seinfeld lol
It's all those naughty kids from Pinocchio
1:24 has got to be the best one
0:44 reminds me of those kids over xboxlive yelling at their mom for something.... "MOOOM!"....... "MooOOOoOooM!"

i think they are trying to communicate
omfg ahh so awesome. made my  night
MUUUUUUUUUM!
Hahahaha EPIC!!!
The second last one is a pygmy goat probably on heat (in oestrus or ready for mating).  The black faced sheep one I suspect is a hoax  
The other goats are jus tmaking  normal goat sounds
i have seen this video so many times now, but it never gets old.
I want a goat now!!!:0
lmfao.i've only met those usual mehhhh ones hahaha
1:38 fucking rofl
I showed this to every teacher at school today. needless to say, i couldnt stop laughin
Ahah
Talyor Swift brought me here

I want a goat...
im now like 90% certain all goats are actually humans captured by circe

nothing will convince me otherwise
1:23 Every argument on the internet ever.
1:59
Mom: "yeeeah?"

In the last one the dog is like what the heck
The last one was amazing
This is so funny. I like the one that says "yeah" at the end, and the one in the Taylor swift video the most, even though they were all funny.
I have seriously watched this thing like 30 times and it just never stops getting funny
1:30 he was saying huh cause he couldnt understand and the last one goat was my  faveorite
LMFAO 0:21-0:27

LMAO the first scene all i could think is the goats are mad for pickin up their shit..and the second is just WOW at that yell lmfao
1:23 LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Last one has to be a fake..
What is wrong with 0:28? Going through puberty or something?
1:45 this is my uncle when he is drunk. no joke.
most of these arent even goats....they are sheep
not fake...if you listen to the video you can hear people laughing hysterically at the goats screaming
@ 1:44 goat sounds drunk
0:44 "mom...moooooom"
that awful screaming of the goats...
1:45 "whaaa? what? what?" lmao
Fake.

Too bad there's no "Absolutely love" button xD
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
1:12 and up i died of laughter, omg i laughed so hard
00:23 That goat is pretty much famous right now...

At the end it sounded like the Black Donkey said " yeaaaaaa" LMFBO
YEAH
Eeeee - aaaaaaaaa- eeeee
The goat at 0:24...I almost peed my pants...
Why are we laughing, their evolving!
Uhh... there's sheep in there too... 1:14 is a sheep. So is 1:40.
1:39 i fucking lost it!
Still love the confused look on the dog's face at the very end...
1:39 "You call that a yell? Lets show 'em Burney."

As a goat myself, I am offended by your comment.

1:38 I lost my s...!
1:37 lol
"what can I do for you" hahaha
Where the fuck is that topdog comment!
0:48 - MUUUUUM!!! MUUUM!!!
facebook. com/KozaNostraiAlpaki  :))
Is that last one even real?
1:15 homer simpson?
0:19 sounds like Steve carrel lol
PEGBOARD NERDS!
Some seem real, but a few just seem like they voiced it over..
I cant stop watching it lmao
loll
Brilliant!
maybe its because im high....but this has to be the funniest video i have ever watched in my life !
wait, im confused.
is this voice over? or is it real? i mean its funny either way..
DAAAAAAAAAAAADDDD
MOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM
The last one is by far my favourite!

0:14
That second goat it awesome
The last goat sounds like Patrick Star...
zinedine zidane Harlem shake SEACH IT!!!!!!!! SEARCH NOWWW
oh my fucking god the one at the end hahahahahaha
I like the ox its funny
the goat at 1:14 that screams looks just like the tall weird looking dude from new McDonalds commercial
Sounds like eddie murphy nyaha but this is freaky mann
1:46 Dude? Something wrong with your mouth? Do you need a dentist?
"i fuckin hate spanish People" 
 1:22
the goat at 1:43 is like numbed at his tongue
The blurry goat was like "Mom/Bob!"
That one goat sings backup for Taylor Swift
the one at 1:43 is the best by far !!!! LMAO
I died at 0:24 ...
1:23 CANT STOP LAUGHING
LMAO TOO FUNNY
The one at the end sounds like he is in some serious distress....OMG that whole skit is hilarious !!
For my next birthday, I'm going to ask for a goat
ah heeell no! i died around 0:28
IM LAUGHING SO HARD OH MY GOSH THIS IS GOLD, THIS IS WHAT THE INTERNET WAS MADE FOR
Okay which one of you sad bastards have been humping some goats? XD
1:14 ROCKS!!!!!!
I can't even breathe-
i lost it at the second one rofl
scary ass goats
0.21-0.30 both of these were on Russell Howard
Hahaha that white goat (1.53)
I'm assuming that all 618 people work for peta and think this is cruelty.
That last one was the BEST!!!
Awesooooome.  Thanks for sharing.
why? WHY???????
GAAAYYY. is what i heard
I have got to get a goat
The last almost made me shit myself lol
WTFF HELLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Idk this makes me so happy
go home,goat.youre drunk.
1:37 oh my god
1:23 Hahah The Goat Spit In The Persons Face
1:23
0:24 gets me everytime
its missing taylor swift :(
The ones that are questionable to me are the higher-pitched screams. The "yeaaaaahhh" at the end is totally edited as there is an unedited video out there. The passive-sounding "ahhh" ones sound more believable since the background noise isn't tuned out while they shout.
meanwhile in Russia...
This video is what the Internet was invented for.
Hahahahahahhahaha. 1:24. HOWLING. sounds like a drunk old man!!
Rise of the Planet of the Goats?
what the fuck did i just watch?
I think my lungs imploded from laughing! XD
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Lol 1:24 XD
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Who dislikes this? The high pitched ones are well funny.
02:00 "Yeeeaaah"
they sound nicer than pop singers
1:23 is like arguing with someone on the internet...
2nd one is fake god damn it now I can´t justify sharing this video...
The first one sounds like Jeff Bridges.
First they talk, now they type. The goats are taking over the world!
You gotta love goats
Yeeeeah -_-
LOLOOOOOOL! "AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"
Right after the last goat said "yeeah", the dog was all like, "heard that?"
that's so scary omg
I want a goat now
ohmagoat.
I love the internet.
I'm glad you survived, mate. I once had a friend who died of coffee. Was because of something else in the coffee though, I can't really remember what it was.
looooool!
omg i'm in pieces!
are these fake?
2:01 Yeaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh..............
their owners must had been banging so hard every night....
Yeeah
The first one is a muslim goat. He yells for Allah..
1:26 You know you're angry when you start shouting at the goat.
no top comment about the last one?
The one at 1:15 sounds like hes on a roller coaster!! Lmaoo
I wonder if Sarah Jessica Parker can communicate with these creatures.
:25, I died! That was like a horror movie scream. Hilarious!
What if these are downs syndrome goats? :(
2:01 sounds like Patrick Star from Spongebob XD
1:31 ftw :D
the last one freaked me out xD
1:15 Woooooooo
1:24 dont disrespect the goat
I love how they're all like "AAA!" then the last one goes "YEEEEAH!" XD
longer clip of goat @ 0:22?
Αυτά παθαίνεις με τριάρες από κάτι λεβάντε...
1:39 the best.
Im on that side of youtube again lol
Are you saying Goats understand the concept behind cameras and, moreover, that they are camera shy?
1:40 Statler and Waldorf: Goat Edition
They forgot how to goat
Leave the goats alone :"-(
WTF am I watching??
If I didn't know about this and heard it, I swear I'd think somebody was dying in agony!
1.40 angry ass goats xD
haha that spits in his face that was so funny
Daaaaan
That last goat was probably saying yes to the guy/woman who was staring at him with camera . Goat: YEAAHH???
YEAAh
That's one pissed of goat at 1:25! Would not want to cross paths with that at night! Respect to the angry spitting goat!
Maybe we scream like them.
1:59 "YEAAAAAH"
bahahaha the funnies thing i have heard in a long time!!!!!
1:34 "Huuuuuh?!"
This is quite funny with a metal instrumental in the background
1:43 lol! The best part.
is this a new trend?
Omg 1:23 omgg :DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD lmao !!! This made my day !
:47 Pee Wee Herman........
609 people are deaf...
AHHHH!
0:30 hahah
i think this would be backing vocal~
lol

It's Spanish. And, by the way, the "dialogue" is very funny:

-Man: "What do you think about Zapatero (the Spanish Prime Minister) government?"

-(goat spits)

-Man: "That's just what I think."
I own goats. They do sound like that.
It's not fake.

there's a reason them goats and sheeps can scream like humans...and it has everything to do with their human handlers getting lonely herding them all the time.

Alot of it seems faked

Thats because its a sheep.
3rd to last, omg. that one was great  XD

1:24 *SPIT* WHAT U SAY BITCH? YEA? SAY IT TO MY FACE THEN! ALRIGHT THEN.

...WHAT?!
Last one was the best!

0:47 is me when I'm stranded on the toilet with no TP.
Apparently you don't know the meaning of the word literally.
I think they flunked their goat sound classes :/
MMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!    MMMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!  MUMMMMMMMM!!!!
Are you a ghost?
The sheep are the funniest part of the video!
AHHHHHHH LMAO
1:23 Fucking Awesome!!!
wtff..... o.o omg....... HAHAAHAHAAHHHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAA xDDDD
Figuratively*
Don't say that. It never is or should be.
Like I want to believe it, but I can't tell if it's fake or not. And I've never been around goats, so....
Funny as hell anyways
fake
:D
So hilarious
1:24. Such an angry goat xD
I am laughing my face off. So funny.
I found my new "bust out laughing cheer me up on a bad day video".  Thank you screaming goats.  You complete me.  Especially you goat at 1:23,  good work.
2:00 Yeeah! :D
the goat at 1:20 is so creepy
I find this video highly disturbing.
Are you saying that the religious people sound like the goat or the atheists do? I like to play devil's advocate, and I've definitely found that religious people have much less intelligent arguments than atheist people, even though I believe in God.
1:23 This is what arguing religion to an atheist feels like.
Literally DIED of laughter! The second goat is a classic.
:25
You do realize that not all these are goats, right?
end one is not real
1:25 LMAO
0:48-0:54
MOMMMMM!!!! MOMMMM!!!

I seriously just laughed out loud!
Fake
Lmfao say this last week and its still funny as hell
Are they real?
Protip: Do not watch this at the library.
Those two black goats at 1.20 scream like they're just gonna break into some martial arts moves!
Holy crap, that is freakin nuts!
Homer Simpson @ 00:24

1:31 "Will you shut the fuck up!?"
1:32 "Fucking idiot..."
1:34 "Did you just try to fucking touch me!?"
some are fake, you can clearly hear that the volume gets cutoff and a new sound comes in.
Omg, this was so awesome! I mean this is just comedy right here...
0:44 - 0:53 sounds like Pee Wee Herman.
1:38 
"Meeeeh?"
"AAAAAAAAH IT'S A MOTHERFUCKING SHEEP"
Do people not know the difference between goats & sheep?  Still funny though.
that's what most of people always do, dude XD that's not something new XDDDD
1:00 ...fuck ooooooooofff
Last one is the best. The dog looks like "What the hell?! Did you hear that too?"
It caught me off guard too. I had to walk out of the coffee shop I was in because people were starting to stare.

No but you must be when you spell productions with a "z" :-) 
Only kids think humour and age have a connection. Im still more intellectual than you i bet ;-)
and you are just stupid who can't laught with anything!!
It's called a sense of humour. You should try it.
and yet your here
oh my god actually crying.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAHA
Wow 31,745 people need to get out more often. These are just goats making noise. Society is in big big trouble.
to compair this with the harlem shake makes me worry for your future
Imagine a sitcom with that spanish/latino guy and the goat living as roommates.

"Goat, stop eating my plants!"
-"Baah? Baah baaaaaah!"

"Goat, why is there poop on the kitchen floor?"
-"Baah baaaah baaah! Baah!"
笑慘了哈哈
Unfortunately, the last one (goat yelling "yeah") is a fake ;)
1:40 Whazaaaa?
anyways its way better than breeding that produces a PIG like YOU.. PIG
Hmmmm, sounds like Washington DC.
Humans yelling like goats next?
maybe they're trying to tell us "please don't eat us"
and he's so STILL

ＨＡＨＡＡＨＡＡＨＡＨＡＡＡＨＡＨＡ　！！
THIS IS FUCKING HILARIOUS
LOL XDDD
this is the only animal that creeps me out hahaha
why even take the time to post on this video then? It's kind of bizarre that you act all holier than thou while also granting views to the thing you supposedly despise. Just because the humour doesn't suit your taste doesn't mean it doesn't have value, you sound like a condescending jackass.
actually, I think the main proof people are retarded is that they think that just because people enjoy watching anomalies in nature makes them mouth breathing idiots, and that they enjoy unrelated and demeaning forms of entertainment. Also that some people think telling others to thumbs them down will make them seem smarter.
also, 1:23 is just like having an argument over the internet :]
OMG! I just fell out of my chair!  LOL
Is this real?
Reincarnation's a bitch.
You're delusional. Just letting you know.
what tea
jajajajajaXD
rofl look @ 1:44 LMFAO To Funny get spit on
Comment.
LMBAO! U make a valid point my friend. If this isn't the dumbing down of society then Idk what is. Ignore the brainwashed sheep they are happy to see some of their own going viral, they will ridicule and mock anyone that speaks outside their grasp of understanding, most are lost causes anyway.
I just actually rofl'd. Actually. xD
srry,i meant to say my teacher showed my class this.Some dude fell out of his chair laughing
My tea
How about you f**k off with your surveys and Nike shoes!
Awwwww Someone's jelly :3
1:46 - 1:58 to je to!
am I wrong o you just got mad bc of this little video. It was actually funny. Nothing wrong in having a little bit laugh now and then. 
You just came and started insulting and making ridiculous asumptionsand deductions. Go and take care of your "business". There are more important issues than that so why you bother.
1:24 Holy crap, this is killing me!
Oh my Goat ...

Goat in the middle: ......AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
1:19 the best xD
0.22 omg xD
So my mother-in-law is actually a goat???
ROFLMAO
You act all superior on the Internet because you're pathetic on the "outside". 

If you said that to me or anyone else "In Real Life" i would ignore you or even punch you because you're a smartass prick.

Now, go study for your big exam which will lead you, in the Future, to work at a place where you'll be "The Bitch" of your Boss and, probably, of your entire office (if you have one) which will then, someday, make you commit suicide for your lack of courage and respect for others.

Goodbye.
Ziegen sind so witzig XD = Goats are so funny XD
One of the funniest videos ever HAHAHA
This is so freaking awesome

Goats are hilarious. If you're ever around them, they're extremely funny to watch and listen to. And on a side note, some of those were sheep... it's too bad that most people don't know the difference.
I was JUST about to ask if anybody had any stories like yours to share... this made my day. sorry about yours, though LOL
Oh my god I can't stop laughing!!

Fake or not, they were all hilarious

My favorite is @1:25
The Silence of the Goats.

LOL 1:23-1:35
Press "7" ...SASSIEST GOAT ON EARTH!
1:37 is the best one hahaha
my god thats creepy as hell
Don't know if this is fake but fake or not its hilarious
Fuck that Spam #7
This video is a sure cure for what ails you. Had a massive fight with my boyfriend, family member is really sick, just stubbed all my toes at once, but god damn I forgot about it all for these blessed few minutes! <3
surely 0:20 has to be fake?
0:22 redneck yelled
Love the one at 0:22! Makes me laugh a lot.
I can't tell if this is fake or not.
everytime i watch this video someone comments saying "i lost my shit" ... lol
The Goat at 1:23 / 2:05 cracks me up every time. :'D
This is so weird, why am I even watching it, because I'm weird...
:25 seconds I lost my shit. My abs hurt from laughing
@Sammiloureeves but it isn't...coming from someone who has owned a goat
jajaja hablan muy bien!
Its still funny, but its fake.
2....8....2....8....2....8
the last one = "yeaaaaah"
90s grunge bands in a nutshell
my jizzing noises bahahahaha
well i got my ab workout in for today. AAAAAAAAAH. heh. but srsly can't stop laughing please send help.
0:23 Lmao
This is why I don't eat goat.
All of these cant be real ... they just sound like human screams dubbed in.  If they are real that's crazy !
00:24
the minute i heard that, i turned into a potato and rolled into the sun
At the end WTF?
LOOOOOL! Funniest video on here! Hahahahahahahahahahahhahaaha xDDDDDDDD
Best part at 1:23 i died.
I like when the goat said baaaaah.
I almost peed my pants watching!!!
This is so funny
Goat you are too drunk
Is this rea
02:00 Say's Dr Dre
0:58 omg sdghjvsssgjn xD
1:23 really hilarious lol
oh look, it's rihanna
I watch this whenever I'm sad and all of my problems go away.
I bet my roommates thought I was crazy when 0:23 rolled around
The first one sounds like Micheal Jackson screaming xD
The utterances of these goats are highly intelligent compared to some of the water cooler gossiping at my workplace.
:D
Hilarious :)
Like a people
The Indoor Kids brought me here!
2:01
LMAO.. grown ass man yelling "mom" at :54
... Yaaaa
That was funny !!
Spam "2" on your keyboard...
Where the hell is Bob already?
Some of these are definitely sheep...
This is the best video I've ever seen.
This is only the beginning of goats taking over the world
these goats seem to have forgotten how to goat
What if humans are the ones yelling like goats?
#DearSomeOne ... 1:24
1:24 هههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه 😂🔫
Jeez the first one is like the audio of goat porn
1:14 and 1:24 are HILARIOUS!!!
2:03 the dog is thinking to himself wtf
Well he did tell the goat to suck his dick... 1:23
Love the end one. YEEEEEEAH.
Kind of horrifying... they seem to be humans trap in the bodies of goats
your comment is as funny as the goats!
0:22 is the best.
I WILL FORCE MY LAZER GOLDFISH TO GET IT BACK SO GIVE IT OR DIEEEEEEEE
Some of these sound utterly fake.
0:44 He lost his ma, apparently
I don't want to get caught looking at this at work. Porn would be easier to explain.
holy moly.. i always heard goats were dumb but..
at 0:30 i tought there was a gap in the goat, until i realised it was a big black spot lol
1:23 xDDD
One more replay wouldn't hurt(;
The second one minds me about when i see my dad in the shower...
0:29 is my favorite.
Meanwhile in Russia...
good shit
What's really annoying is how self-righteous you are about it.
I've been laughing all week at this. God bless YouTube....... and Goats.
wait. i know u!! -o- u just commented after me on smosh pit! ._.V what a small world.
I should probably do my homework.
Last dude was like (Barry white) "YEAAAHH"
Actually, they're screaming with excitement... life is just a big roller coaster to goats!
1:23 Satan?
I believe stupid people are evolving into goats.
0:24 hahahahahahaha
why arent people more sensitive to animals? from the responses this video got, it's clear why the world's flora and fauna are in so much trouble. No-one here even senses that goats, as well as every other animal on this planet, are living beings. Other beings have feelings too, and can sense love as well as give love. the goats in this video were obviously frightened and under stress. Stupid human beings can't even see that.
true :)
ROFL
its like there almost as smart as parrots
Bob left so many goats brokenhearted.
hey :D goats are actually cute but stupid people are not....so I dont think youre right! :D
The last one. Oh my Goat. I almost passed out from laughing so hard.
-What do you think of Zapatero's government?
-BBfffff
-Same here, and what do you think of the canarian government?
-Ggggaawww, ggaaaawww
-And what about the island's municipalities?..
oh my god goats are evolving into chris tucker
Fake, I can hear the pixels...
can anyone translate what the guy is arguing about in 1:23
Tumblr brought me here
THIS IS EPIC

2:01 The dogs reaction is priceless.
YEEA.
Just a bunch of crazy kids
0:24 Best Haha
Lol the baby one was cute
LOLOLOLOL 1:00
We are more related to goats and sheep than we thought... I wonder when we'll find one speaking.
AFK brought me here.
1:44 Sounds like Steve Carell!
2:01 YEAHHHH
That yell at 0:22 is clearly fake... and some other ones...in fact a lot of them are fake
yeah, they are two different animals and I was just trying to inform the general public that is not surrounded by agirculture on a daily basis.
0:24 so fake
Not ba-ad! (Susbscribe to DemoCastMedia Channel).
this is the funniest stuff I have seen for a long while hahaha
Humans yelling like goats

/watch?v=lB_w0wegltM
She knows too much! Release them!
reminds me alot of belsimpel commercials
does it really matter?
1:23, that's some quality footage
this made me laugh so hard i was crying :22 was the best one haha!
Goat 4 sale!
I believe goats are evolving into stupid people.
1:23 lol
"YeeaaAHHh"
literally died watching this! hahahahahahha
And you can tell this is real because of the voice popping when the tone goes down. Thought this was another fake video at first.
MOM!!!! MOMMMM!!!! MOMMM!!!!
What is that? Is that a deer? Oh you. You so random! ;) @ 1:02
0:24 and 1:16 HOLY DUPER GIGA ULTRA OMEGA FUCK !!!! those yelling are real ????? WTF

2:01 yeeeeeeeeeaah
OMFG IM SOBBING

WTF Are you watching Al??
351 peopl-BAAAAAAAAHHGGGHH
Hahahahhahahahahhah! LOL. the sad part is, is i searched this up myself. dont ask.
Creepy but super funny LOL
They saved the best for last - when the German Shepherd hears the goat and makes an expression like "WTF?"
Damn shape-shifters screaming for help, don't know why we keep them alive.
"Help me I've been turned into a goat!"
fucking answer them, Bob.
The last one @2:00 :3 (funny despite sounding very fake-ish)
Damn that's funny
That was the best 2 minutes of my life...
00:44 "MOMMMM! MAAAA! .....MOMMMMMM!"
There's some sheep in there... and yes there is a difference between goats and sheep :)
1:41   "bah" "bah" "AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH" just amazing haha
Those aren't all goats. It's annoying that people overlook that. It's also annoying that people don't know the difference.
hahahaah freaky
Rape face at 2:03

Fake but funny
1:24 AHAHAHAHAH

2:00
YEAAHH!
Hallarious! The funniest animal video ever
Thumbs up if you laughed soooo hard!
I think this video and "What I Did All Weekend" are my two favorite on youtube
a couple of them were really fake. It was obviously dubbed over by a person screaming in a room (even though the footage is outdoors) it's pretty obvious.
u really made me laugh, this is so true :)
1:37 ="=
it actually IS for real....
The funniest ever on youtube - and the best is - IT´S  NOT FAKE
my wife keeps telling me she wants a baby goat.  OMFG can you imagine hearing this at sunrise every day?
Laughed too hard, I no longer have any sides.
omg at 1:23 I couldn't breathe!!!!
1:25!!! Lmao
Haha I want a goat now
ha ha goats are so weird.
Sitting here home alone, laughing like a fucking lunatic at this video. Oh my werd. :']

Très bonne thérapie du rire

1:26 my new favorite moment in history
Help! Help! The fuckers have tied me up! Help! Help!

MARCO! POLO! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
1080p Yelling Goats.
Hahaha!
WTF was that last one?!
I'm going to make this my alarm.
The goat at 1:43 sounds like my drunk Uncle Mannie.
The fake ones kinda ruin it...
Then i switched to porn because it was easier to eplain
Those that are screaming are SHEEP.
Omg they're so cute lmao
0:43

BOB!!!!!!! BOB!!!!!!!!
крут
Like if George Takei brought you here.
Lol, 0:22 is definately the best and caught me ofguard. Very funny.

The one at the end is prolly the hardest to believe its real :P
thankyou for putting this together.
Crying tears of laughter...
0:43, the original and the best
1:16 woah spit came out. 2:02 Yeah.
1:25 to 1:36 I can't stop laughing
some of these are obvious fakes but the rest are amazing and hilarious!
I was pissing myself until the end....then i shit myself !!!
Timmah!
This is what the internet was created for!
Oh my god, i think im gonna die, HAHAHAH! thats so funny, i love this!

Awesome, sign them up for voice over work on horror movies!!!
2:01 , Dog like WTF!!
0:44 Usher!

"well I'll be, Greatest Of All Time" was his reaction.
Goats are awesome!!
I've never laughed so hard.  Omg!!!!!!
John Baahner at his best...
0:50 FUUUUUCK! FUUUCK!
So funny :,)
BAAAAAAAAAA
1:25 I'm sorry if I'm offending anyone, but I wouldn't smacked that goat in the face after that.
Fake.
Last was the best
freaky

1:23-1:37 เหมือนคุยกันรู้เรื่องนะ 555+
I'M CRYING HAHA OMG
Thanks for that, I needed a good laugh. That German Shepherd at the end is priceless!
Omg that last one! O-0
The second one is fake. You can hear the background noise fade out when the goat is yelling. The last one is also fake. The rest I think are real. Hilarious nonetheless.
@00:46 Bob! Bobbbb!
This makes me happy.
they did not say like humans
Are any human sounds dubbed in this?????    Really wonder....but it sure is hilarious!!!!
1:23-1:37 I can't stop crying lol
There are six sheep in here!  Including the thumbnail!!
1:37
FAKE AND GAY
Daniel Bryan
i want to hear one that sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger..."Aughaugha ugh augh!!"
GIVE ME MY JELLYFEESH BACH
Eeeeeeeeed! Heeeeeeeelp!
@2:00

This is just goddamn horrendous.  I am disturbed to the core.  Liked.
Are we really to believe that last one?
Funny.
330 people laughed so hard that they clicked the dislike button by mistake.
freakin' goats xD
Reminds me of congress.
I died XD
They're learning our ways! Its not long until they know how to speak
0:24 LOL!!!!
Well. I can see you're very affectionate of goats, that's something I admire. You know, I certainly will do my research and quite possibly invest in now. Thanks, man, I do believe you may have improved my life just a little. You have a great life yourself, I suppose, so yeah. Ricardo, here I come :)
I can't eat goats anymore after watching this
1:23 is gunna be from now on how I deal with people that are bothering me
The third goat gets me every time.
"MOOOOM!"
"MOOOOOOOMMM!!!"
Iast one is fake as Gil

That one at :24. I almost peed myself....
goats are sooo cute :D
No..CNN
Fake or not i freaking LOVE this!
Same. I'm dying going, "why am I laughing tho?!" this is the best video on the internet.
I was preparing for a high pitched voice on the last one, I shit in my pants.
Help!Heeelp
todas unas loquillas!
1:15 my favorite
I think they're all fake. "Super cut videos"
The last one is fake
1:25   Best. Argument. Ever.
yeaaaaa... 2:00
LOL 
0:43 MOM!!! MOM!!! MOM!!
They were yelling because they found out that they became the acronym for 
whiteboy7thst's "Subscribers"
This is how God punishes all the people who bought Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift records. He turns them into goats.
I am crying right now laughing so hard. I dont even know why I'm actually laughing. At this point, I think they should come get me
- Uniiiiiii
- Meeeeeeeeeeeeehhh
I need a goat
Proof that reincarnation is real...and that it hurts.
yeeeaaah
I eat all of them.
Maybe it's humans who yell like goats.
1:37 UAHAUAHAUAHAUHAUAHAUAHAUAHAUAHAUAHAUA LOL
1:22 is perfect
There's like four fake ones in there, fucking fail.
XD I love tho
Lolwat...
The last one just killed me. xD
Bob! (0:50)
Goats? I thought this was Fox News!
hahahaha
Sounds like big foot
Sounds like Arabs
They speak with the tongue of man!
1:37       i can watch that shit a thousand times and still laugh
OH JESUS CHRIST THE SECOND ONE I'M DYING
Can never takes Silence of the Lambs seriously any more...
the one right before the last 1 was the best!
0:24 and 1:40 really broke my ability to breathe there for a bit...
hahahahaha
So funny! This cannot be real! :) 
Love it!
Where the fuck is Bob?
I lost my shit at 0:24
I hope so.. How I wish laughing could cure cancer.
Evolution. Animals are learning how to speak. Which is awkward to say the least, especially when a human tries to slaughter goats that are cursing him in a language he understands.
damnn it's hilarioussss haha, and omg they are soooo cuteee <3
What if these are humans that have been turned into goats, and they're trying to tell us?
1:24 - that goat waited to spit in his face instead of on the back of his head. like a boss.
312 humans yell like goats.
The second goat owes me a keyboard and a new drink.
I have not had such a good healthy laugh in so long. Thank you
Da fuq did I just watch
This is good news thank you. Your homework is to destroy Fox News and continue to vote for the Democrats. Thanks for your time redofspades and have a good life
Jajajaja Lol I loved it but I am sad because they are yelling like if they were suffering
Gets my vote for funniest video on youtube right now. It's been a while since I've been in tears.
The goat at the end sounds like Sponge Bob's friend Patrick.
02:00 could become a meme I'd say.

"JEAH"
Yeaaa I lold
I could watch 1.25 all day on repeat.  Most awesome scene ever.
1:23 - 1:36 is just so unbelievably great
Not...that...sure...might..be...funniest...thing...ever...
greatest compilation in internet
Reminds me of Regular Show...
I have cancer.... But you're right :)
I can tell you haven't been to America either, he is foreign by the way, he is from Denmark. You're British and you accuse Americans of being nationalistic, you're a hypocrit, no one has conquered other lands than Britain. Most Americans aren't nationalistic at all, vast majority don't care about the country but only themselves and family, infact many citizens hate America because of its politics, economy, division between people, and multiculturalism to be brutally honest.
The second, third, sixth, and last goat sounded fake. If only they knew Bob...
Yeah, but how about them goats!
Stop spreading your silly lies. This cures HIV.
Bob is our souls, the very fabric of our being. Bob is who we truly are, we may not know it but inside we are all Bob. Bob is the person who keeps you going through thick and thin. Bob is what holds us together, with everyone else in the universe. Bob is us.
Goats learned yelling like us after all the human sacrifices they've done.
What the hell does this have to do with goats?
the 2nd one sounds like ned flanders
I love it when Family Guy does that whole thing. I can tell you're a good American now, thank you for replying. Please spread your goodness to other Americans like redofspades and make your country appear less Romney to the outside world.
Thank you so much!!!!! Awesome!
By stating that he hasn't been to America you agree that he must be foreign because most American's- I imagine about 52% by your count- are so nationalistic that they can't take a joke about the USA. You say 48% aren't 'even' white- I suggest you read that back to yourself and reconsider your phrasing.
1:39
0:25  самый ржак))))
Lolololololol
OMG, the last one, YEEAHHHH! HAHAHHAHAAH
"No you shut up!!!" "No you shut up!!!"
What's your opinion? 48% of people in America aren't even white and most whites in America are a mix of German, Italian, and Irish, so what is American?
1:23
Goats: "I'm bored to death"
Literally thinks all Americans speak with the same dialect
a jeśli to z bólu...?
The last one is a fake :/
they learned to scream like that because of lonely danish farmers ;)
this cures cancer
Miss Proasheck brought me here
I almost had a heart attack on 1:23
Joke right, sure. And are you joking too or just being an asshole in spite? I rest my case. Nobody likes someone who thinks and acts like they are better than somebody else based simply off of where they come from. Should I ask you if you have all your teeth being from the UK and all? Oh, only joking of course. So that should make it all right right?
muuuuuuum! muuuuum! muuuuuum! MUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUM! LOL some of the goats sounded like it was saying that
The last one sounds like Patrick from Spongebob. lol
if you get lost in the woods and you lost your voice screaming for help.......find a goat and make it yell :D
the 3rd one is high as fuck :D
He must be foreign if he's making comments like that eh?
You only make yourself look American with your complete lack of the ability to take a joke.
You only make yourself look bad with that kind of stereotypical-thinking and bigotry.
Funny as hell :)
Aaaand straight to favourites
1:59 YEAAAAAA
There is no American dialect or American people anymore you idiot, it's just a conglomerate of different people now, you just haven't been here.
Bullshit, funny though.
yeeeeaah
Wow funny I guess :/
@Thundersplorer WTF U tryed to masturbate at gotes
This must have been where the Doritos's goat came from....
1:16 sounds like homer simpson's scream ahaha
1:23 MY SIDES
funny but this is a little bit creepy
i think its broken.
And thats how the American dialect came to be.
lol, totally homer simpson
LOOOOOL so funny!
The scream @0:23 sounds suspicious. 
There's a weird auto cutoff right after, leading me to believe that it was dubbed over by an actual human.
STOP IT, RON, STAUHHHP.
Well, now cats have a competitor on Youtube.
I love the dog in the last one. He's like WTF!
Also 1:20 sounds like homer simpson screaming.
most of these goats sound like grandpa simpson.
It's possible, you just got to try really hard.
Now the owner's of those goats should breed them together and use natural selection to create a new race of hyper-intelligent/hyper-human-sounding demon's. Then send them back in time to mess with early humans.
/watch?v=B9Hc204XVNA :D
2:00 yeeeeeeeah
Jacksgap brought me here
Ahahhahahahahahahahahah the 2nd one
i died when the 2nd goat screamed.
Last goat:  "Yeah..."
why not Donald ? a goat is an awesome pet... smarter than a dog...but you have to be careful...they are very clever at getting out of their pens..I had a pen that was 6 feet tall and one of my goats was able to easily jump out of it !! I had to put a top on the pen! they are so much fun though... they follow you and can be very playful
When a goat yell it is like a man yell. Yagshimesh!
Goats Yelling Like Retards
What kind of dog is in the last clip?
Nope. That's the sound mixer adjusting the amplitude. If you make it about 12 times louder at the "splitting" part, you'll hear the background again. I made the same mistake once.
Zoey brought me here.
Zoeya?
1:37 has me absolutely in tears with laughter XD
The last one is fake.Funniest one is the one which sounds like someone being murdered.
Lmao
My internal organs still bleed...
the one at 0:22 is overdubbed.  You can hear where they've spliced the audio.
These are not goats! These are people who have been turned into goats by that evil blair witch woman.  These may even be those kids that got lost in the woods back in the mid ninties when all that took place.  Bless their goat hearts, we can't do anything for them.  We can't turn them back into human beings, they just need to live out their goat lives and be has happy as possible!
I found this surprisingly difficult to masturbate to.
0:46 potato camera!
:24 seconds, DIED ROFL
1:23 LOL, that thing is hilariously offended by that man.
This video gets me everytime! XD lmao!
I'm on that part of youtube again..
Bahahaha!!! Valid point.
Monkeys look like humans and goats scream like humans omfg lol
that 2nd on, lmao!
Did you expect an insightful top comments that would change your world view when you clicked on this goat video? It's just a logical reply to the former top comment.
bahahahah

AHHHHHHHH!
it has started  the end is near
Still better than listening to One Direction
XDDD
Go Ats, are so darn funny
Brought here by a zombie video wtf ??? XD
omg @1.23
my right index finger brought me here.
Brought here by reddit.
who cares
died at the ones sounding like girls
0:22 sounds like Homer Simpson when he realizes he is out of beer.
this is why people used to think Goats where the Devil :I
Better than listening to peacocks..
1:24

Not only does the goat spit, but it screams in the guy's face. That's awesome.
Now I know why Agent Starling was so desperate for the silence of the lambs.
the biggest mistake of all my life to watch this video when high
Gosh that would have been glorious.
I would be yelling if they were gonna sluaghter me too.
That last one is fake.
Press '8', and again just before it hits 1:43.  Somebody could easily make that into a sick beat.
I forgot how to goat.
Truly these are the end times.
Then you've seen some weird shit to get here.
The last one was fake
1:54 TIMMEH!
nobody brought me here
Ok, I have to ask. Is this real or edited?? Can goats really sound like this?
Good lord....surely one of the signs of the apocalypse! LMFAO!!
WTF
brought myself here
I brought myself here at gunpoint.
towell chat
lmao
I was seriously expecting one of these goats to do the Wilhelm scream.
1:41
goats: bahhhhh
other goat: -looks around- 
AHHHHHHHHH
He's asking the goat what it thinks about the government (Spanish government to be exact)
a youtuber.
what if goats where humans?! what if they were just secret agents covered in hair and were sent to gather information to send to the government!?
For some reason, it sounds like a black guy yelling!
Same!
The one at 1:45 sounds like he is responding to someone yelling. Like "AAAAH!" and he responds with "DEEEEEEH!"
i feel sorry for them
1:17 I didnt see that coming.
Sheep and goats are funny!  Doesn't everyone know that?
0:23 IS THE BEST! CRYING!!! ;D
A bunch of these goats are actually sheep
I was waiting for a cute adorable goat with a deep voice
I was not dissapointed xD
Love that part.  It's like the guy is trying to argue with it.  Hope for his sake that was staged...
The fact that this has 3 million views is what is funny. Idiocracy, here we come.
1:33 The FUCK did you just say?
Search "Don't argue with an ibex".
who the fuck is zoey proasheck
Holy crap, I was NOT expecting that last one to have such a low voice. Also, I love the one at 1:23. Sounds/looks like they're having a fight.
I'm cryiiiiiiinnngggggg oh my gaaaaaaaawd~
Goats are terrifying.
George Takei brought me here.
Is there a full video of the one that shouts and spits at the reporter cus that is just amazing. Genuinely looks like the goat is trolling him on purpose!
287 people have 0 sense of humor.
The second one is fake.
BIIILLLLLLLL
The one at 0:24 KILLS me! HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!
Now I want a pet goat.
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Someone needs to stop moving the floor on that goat at 1:43
Love the goat at the end
Can I has a goat? Unlike ThatFreak, I'll love it, and I'll name it Ricardo.
It's like there's a human stuck inside each one of those goats and they're crying for help. But it's too funny for them to be taken seriously.
Go home drunk, you're goat
They all sound like Pee Wee Herman.
is anyone here a vet
1:59.... -Thinking...: Okay.. big finale... "YEEAAH" -Dog is terrified-
Thumbs up if you came from reddit lol
Zoey you silly girl.

1:59 the dogs face is amazing, lmao
MOOOOM! MAAA!
Me watching Twilight.
why am i watching goats?
0:22, I can't stop laughing
XD
Borderline demonic?..
Sounds like after a long night at the bar.
I forgot how to goat!
why would you throw something at an animal? I've had goats ...and I've brought them to fairs... I guess it's because of people like you that I never let them stay over night there, but brought them only on the days that their classes were held. They bleat because they are telling you of their needs... they are either hungry, thirsty, or they want to be somewhere other than where they are... not because they are antagonized ... which again brings me to... why would you anyway?
Were or are these humans reincarnated as goats? ;)
This video helped me find enlightenment
The equivalent of an Obama speech, lol.
Ohh.. MAKE IT STOP XD :'D
... Can't stop laughing at 1:26 ...
Lol the third was a human scream
Is this real!? hahaa
LMFAO!! I WAS JUST DYING HERE!! CANT STOP LAUGHING!!!!!!!!!!!!! WAHAAAAAAAAAHAHAHA!!!
I wonder if Jay Park was really bored that he ended up watching this kinds of videos LMAO
I started to laugh so hard at that one ! x'D seriously I was tearing up LMAO
O-0 what just happened
Press 2, lol
oouhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1:40 shut up!
2:01 : Yeeeah...

Hahaha this is hilarious OMG
Oh god please tell me 0:23 is real. That made me nearly piss my pants.
i'm fucking crying oh my god
to the same thing that has always been.
The first youtube video it's a man in a zoo talking about how big the elephant dick is.
Wow I did not know that also applied to goats! That's insane! Thanks for letting me know :) ps good up the good work on the violin
as long as it's a good tool like a screwdriver, that's ok.
Your still a tool though ;)
some parts are so fake, but everything is so lovely! : )
thanks zoey.
That's not italian, he's talking about Zapatero so he's spanish, dumbass
Nobody gives a shit
GOAT SPIT ON ME ?
I SPIT BACK ON HIM !!!
I'm not taking that shit from a fucking goat - or anything else >:|
go home goat, you're drunk
1:41 fucking lol'd
She said "i thought someone was screaming for help but it was just the goat" which means she thought a HUMAN was screaming for help but it was just the goat yelling. The goat wasn't screaming for help...
The last one, I couldn't breathe xD
Jay Park brought me here <3
0:22 is dubbed, as is a few others.
The last one is my favorite. Also, Zoey Proasheck sent me here.
0:22 is the best
Whenever my parents call me i say 2:01
Questo non è niente al confronto con il cane parlante, l'orso che chiama la mamma e l'alce che chiama la mamma.
The last one is the best , also Zoey brought me here
hahahahaha fuukkk the first one though
<--------------
Last one is the best
1:15 xD
Go home goat , you're drunk
MUUUUUMMM!! THE MEAT LOAF
last one the best hehehehe
I don't understand what would cause this..
lol, learn to understand what is a joke and what isn't.
Read that back to yourself and realise how much of a tool you are. :)
LOL, check out my channel too!!!!
Jay park sent me too lol
ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋhahahaha it good
how do you know that spitting in your face isn't the height of etiquette for a goat, you don't know their culture! We could be the ones who are rude for wiping it off and that's why they get annoyed.
Fucking brilliant
LOL!
I disagree, the scream at 1:17 is shorter I think. Who cares anyway, it's still hilarious.
this is the creepiest thing on earth
Jesus Christ.
that is so funny.  i loved it.  cant tell if it was the goats or a person.  i rate this video.as a A++++.
I can always trust Yogscast Zoey to bring me somewhere good :D
Daaaa fuuuuuup?
1:52 you can hear a raving rabbid in the background
The goat was screaming for help and you did nothing...??? says a lot about who YOU are as a person...
1:46 sounds like my old 2 stroke dirtbike.
My neighbor has a goat and one time late at night i thought someone was screaming for help but it was just the goat XDD
Lol
1:40 Goats hate sheep.
Chav Goat will spit in yo face xD
Is the second one fake? O.o
the last one is probably fake
They aren't fucking sheep
I kinda feel like these sheep have an actual problem,like some kind of illness and i don't know if i should feel bad for them xD
The last one.
oh my fucking god. So funny.
The German shephard int he background is like "are you listening to this arsehole, man?"
0:24 ringtone pls
/watch?v=NqDaMSk00wA
As to the why? I have no idea.
I'm sorry, but I think I just pissed my pants a little at 0:26
zoey?
Amazing
1:23 LOL
After watching this vid I can confirm I can't breathe & I have tears rolling down my face!
2:00 DAT GERMAN SHEPARD ♥

I've never laughed this hard and cried this much in my life.
The ones at 0:22 and 1:17 are fake, if you listen closely they make the exact same noise
0:30
1:44 sounds like Ed from Ed Edd n Eddy
1:25 "hey, I'm-a walkin here"

1:44 i want that goat lol :D
2:00 xDDD
1:23 is the most hilariously belligerent animal I've ever seen. :P

Haha the guy arguing with the goat needs subtitling
00:22 and 1:17 so weird! And the guy arguing with the goat...very weird!
The second one cracks me up every time!
The one with the goat arguing with the Italian guy destroyed me.
This is the best thing ever
THE GOAT ARMY IS RISING!!!!!!
:23 is a sheep and so is 1:13 and 1:40 is a pair of sheep. The very last little critter is a black lamb. Is it really so difficult to tell them apart?
lol the ending YEAAAAHHHHH! i know somebody who sounds like that ima show him.
These are the sounds of F.S. victims.
Knew Babe was fucking real!
Every time my neighbor goes around his goats the little ones start yelling Dahahahahaddyhyhyhyhyhy!
Goats are fucking creepy.
I cried I laughed so hard
I agree with you... but grammatically speaking, most funny is not correct, it's funniest.
It's Shauna sheep It's Shauna sheep.
But... you never know, though.
Its so funny but i get kinda sad when they sound like they yell "mooooommm!!"
So... you a republican?
Or maybe ma.
Is this a legit noise that they make???
Humans Yelling Like Goats
I would really hate to hear the noises they are all making when they are banging each other.
1:24.. Holy mother of god. Spits on him and screams at him.
1:19, too funny.
Best/most funny scream is at 1:41
OMG I'M CRYING 1:25 OMG LMFAO
Yeah.....

Goats <3
0:25 kills me

0:15 
WILL FERRELL, IS THAT YOU?
1:22
Man says something that is an insult in the language of goat. 
1:24
Goat spits on man out of anger and yells at him
1:27 
Goat is proud, but man fights back
1:29
Goat: What's wrong with you
1:31
Goat: Just... Just leave me alone!
1:32 
Goat: I hate you.
1:34 
Goat: What?
There's a man stuck in the goat's body!
This is like listening to lil Jon.

Waaaaaahhhh!!!!

XD omg... 2:25 "AAAAAA!!!" o god... that made me start to cry of funnyness
"HEY, THIS LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I SEE IN MY SHELTERED LIFE, THEREFORE IT MUST BE FAKE!!!"
get the fuck over yourself, loser.
Holy shit I almost threw up I was laughing so hard
Nah man, I've seen goats do it at the Fair, you tick one off by throwing stuff at it, it'll scream ay ya
Fake.
niggas be like 1:24 .......
"yeaaaaaahhhhhhhhh" hahahahaha!
I'm in tears
When you slash their throats for slughter they sound like babies screaming.
a few of them are dubbed... and the others... well I guess folks just need to get to a barn more often to hear what animals sound like ......
1:15 needs to be the new "Wilhelm scream".
my pawpaw had some goats and they just made normal noises. LOL
Maybe I'm weird but it's scary for me
its like the wind got knocked out of him 0:31 hahahaha
As a psychic and animal communicator, I have to say I am so happy that these goats are FINALLY being heard. It's not easy living the animal life. These poor guys are constantly being mistaken for sheep. This is a cry for acknowledgement, people. I recently had one of those myself (big surprise since it was Valentine's Day...)
Is this real haha awesome
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA THE GOAT SAID "YEEEAAAAAAAHHH!!!"
why is that funny xD
I think I am on the weird side of youtube again..
0:57
So of these are obviously fake, but for the real ones, well they're just more proof that goats are going to take over the world
I love when they scream. Its like the Dorito commercial. So funny when goats scream high pitched
Jabum Park Bring Me Here lol

Jay Park Sent me here ^^
I don't care if any of these are fake. I'm dying laughing.
Marianas Trench brought me here. lmao
The second, last, and high pitched "AAAAAH!" Ones are fake. I have goats, and sometimes they sound like this:3
I'm really concerned with what Ramsay does on the internet
Crying with laughter
ahha...I can't stop laughing
The last one seems the most legit, everything else was clearly dubbed over.
YYYYYEAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
They were asked what they thought of Joe Biden
This reminds me of that part of Disney's Pinocchio when the boys get turned into donkeys.
That the funniest things I've seen on YouTube in a while....yeeaahhh
i lost it at 1:24 oh my god
This scares me
This is how I like to spend my Saturday nights..
2nd one was fake, you could tell cause the audio cut out when it screamed.
Yeeaaaaah
Screamingly funny. Literally. Really well done, nice blend of real goat sounds and the , uhh, not so goat-ish sounds. I look forward to more from you jokers, hope this isn't just a one off.
She's screaming "Let me the hell out of this gate!"
At 0:17 doesn't that sound like Pee Wee Herman? AHH!
you think this is freakin' when they slaughter lambs they cry like kids. That's where the title "Silence of the lambs" comes from.
This is so fucking scary
Iam so wet right now
2:01 "YEEEEEAAAAHHHH"
Wish you hadn't put in the fake ones, they're funny enough as is.

This is funny, but you guys really have to learn to tell the difference between goats and sheep. (Sheep appear at :21, 1:12, 1:37, and 1:59.)
"MOOOOOOOM!" "DAAAAAAAAD!!"

I love it how the guy kept going and played along after the goat spat on him.
lol the dog at the end in the last clip was like,  "...the fuck?"
Better than the hunger games.
Who came here from Yahoo?
the second one sounds like something from a movie, I wonder if they use a goat or a real person for that sound effect now lol
1:37
It was a baby. Could've been there temporarily.
We had to keep a newborn inside for a week or so. c:
haha the last ones face. frickin hilarious!
I had a goat that did that! I didn't think to record it though. D:
Sounds like a bunch of Politicians... or are these democrats in the Senate?
so this is what entertains me on the internet now?
Favorite one from 1:36 to 1:43
Goats: Meeehhhhh
Goat's reply: Aaaaahhhhhhh
LOL
Maybe they're impersonating us the same way we often impersonate them... who knows?
WAAHAAHAAAHAHA
The dubbed ones are SO not funny!
As the goat at 2:00 said...
Oh my god
Some of these goats do need a record contract. Nothing a little autotune can't fix. Just ask Rebecca Black.
Bawls.... I literally just posted the same thing and didn't see your comment.. FAIL on my part.
User, is that you?
"MOM!!!! MOM!!!!!!!!!" MOOOOOOMMMM!!!!!!!"
@0:37 I thought that goat had a really weird back, then I realised it was the wall behind that was the same colour..
The year 2013, we still don't have flying cars but at least goats can yell.  We are making progress.
Omg my sides! My sides they hurt so bad!
MOM! MOM, MOOOOM!!! MOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!
Are these what those adorable baby goats that leap about the backyard grow into?!
Thanks for the hernia.
I should be out trying to get laid,
But here I am watching goats yell,
No wonder I never get laid,
ugh.
2:00 YEEEAAAAHHHH

Hahaha too funny
Yea that's the best one.. I peed my pants.
1:25 - Stone Cold Goat Austin
His fake what?
1:24  still better drama than Twilight...
They sound like my neighbours the caprio  family
That awkward moment when your goat yells like a human...
I was dying of laughter while digging out all those comments :)
is that really goat's voice or some men shouting from behind? i doubt
I think 0:23 and 1:14 sounds similar...
00:21 1:13 1:37 1:59 I just can't stop laughing
1:37 beeeeeeeeee AAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Omg
The very last one, is that a goat in the house. House pet?
:/
Hilarious!
haha xD This nearly made me laugh more than the video ^^ Glad SOMEONE is taking these things SERIOUSLY!
WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?
1:24

"This goat was charged with statutory rape"
Goat "Bullshit"
"Its true, she was still a kid(young goat)
Goat "No!"
So your saying you didn't sleep with her?
Goat" Thats not what I meant."
Goat" Man fuck this
See see I was right
Goat: " I already stopped arguing shut up."
1:37 gets me each time! XD I am reminded of the Muppets for some reason.
Sounds like peewee Herman
2:00
Who knew something as simple as a goat yelling like a human could make me laugh do hard.
this just made my day, speaking of, did that goat ever find bob?
1:45 is my favorite :D :D
the fucked up one is a sheep :)
Yeah, goats actually make this sound on occasion.
Been down in the dumps since valentines day.. this cheered me up a bit really appreciate it. Life should be full of laughs every day!
i would def use goats in a horror movie/game/porn :))
I don't know if I should be laughing or be scared. LMAO.
okay, interesing :D ...thanks jack for sending me here ;) :D
check out the best top comments for this video :)
Never thought I would hear my Dad hollowing at the goats again. This is spooky. They are now trying to call him.

0:49 - 0:53 "Heeeeeeeelp"

Thank you, Jackson! :D
0:43 Did that goat ever find Bob?
indeed!
google "mega breaking soul traps"
Jack, what the hell are you watching?
They can scream like each other. Just like dogs of the same breed usually bark a lot like.
1:09 "what can I do for you?"
the dog at the end is all like ''WTF''??
Just like fifth grade when told recess is over!
Wtf
Almost 2million views in just 1 day and a half. Incredible...
''MOOOOM!!!''
Yeeeeeeahhh! 02:00
0:24 ROTFLMFAO
I think 0:20 and 1:12 are fake. The dubbing is not natural. The rest are definitely real.
The last one is Patrick Star in disguise
That last one.
aahahhahaaahhas
"Yeah."
the one at 1:12 is just crazy, I laughed for like 20 mins because of it, I cant even breath its so funny LMFAO.
I need to get me one of those goats, damn that's funny.
0:44 Usher goat
WTF lol
hahahahah jebłam, padłam, KURWA SPADŁA M!
clearly dubbed over
Humans yell?
1:12 killed me.... :DDD
I wonder if some of these sounds were from Dead Space....
@SuperEvilMel totally agree
Hahahaha, my mom was the one who sent me this video xD
Were those true?
lol too funny
fake
1:23:
Shut up.
blalblalblalbla
SHUT UP!
blablablabla
I SAID SHUT UP!
blablabla
up.
Maybe they are yelling to let them free
That was absolutely terrifying!
lol That last one sounds like Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants!
CATHERINE!!!!
lmfao!
The last one "yeeeahhh"
1:23 was funniest :DDDDDDD
Oh it can, a lot of animals if they are around humans enough will start to mimic  their noises.
The last one:
"Yeaaaahhhhhhh"
This is disturbing..... Human souls trapped in goats.
I almost choked to death from laughing to hard!
Hahaha!! :) Love it!
Why would I be? :O
Creepy
For reasons I am not sure I understand myself, this is the funniest thing I have EVER seen. Damn near killed me.
1:20 Is so great
BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Dear Bob, please own up! They've been looking for you every where. I mean it, EVERYWHERE!! LOL
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOB WHERE ARE YOU BOB
This is the internet.
1:44 . cant ........ stop ......... lauging ! XD
dat ending
Shut up you stupid hippy
I asked myself the same thing until 0:24 hit. Damn near spit out my drink.
1:36 ROFL :D "määh... ARGH!" :D
anyone know where the original vid is to the spitting goat one thats fucking brilliant XD
THIS CANNOT BE REAL!?
Are these all real?
1:40 is too funny
They would be used for the CSI intro.
"and at the point she said...oh my GOAT" -YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAHHHHHH
Yeah
I find it much more enjoyable when they have human screams before I sacrifice them to my pagan gods
See how fucking annoying most people sound...

'Adults' yelling, smirking, giggling & blathering almost 24/7 worse than children 

Whatever happened to people showing some maturity/evolution, class & character 

Thank-you goats for showing the world
hahahahahaqhahahah
yeeeah
i was eating a double bacon cheeseburger when i read this, not even joking. But guess what, it was still fucking delicious.
25 secs is fake. you can hear the clip cutting off
some are real some are fake
1:23
hahaha goats are so fucking stupid. I love it.
Dude, when burgers are involved, you can't ask for respect.
Funniest stuff I have seen on here for a while!! Classic!!
The last is fake ^^
I am a goat and I find this very offEEEEAAAA-
nvm..
Oh my god 0:28
The new Michael Jackson's
only youtube!!!
the last one was edited. that i can confirm
0:22 is my favourite!!
1:12..best goat
I'm actually aware of this. I just couldn't help but imagine these goats in the wild confusing the hell out of pre-modern people, making them think there are people crying in the woods.
"The goat cried in the woods so many times we didn't believe it when it was an actual person."
Or something. Cry human, maybe.
Baaaaahaaaaaaaa omfffgggggggvvvvvv cd sxvbhzsrg hb jjf
1:20 was the best
The end though...omfg.
Thanks jack for sending me to weird videos.....
HAHAHAHAHA don't get stoned and watch this HAHAHAHAHA can't stop laughing HAHAHAHA what have I done? HAHAHAHAHA
what does jack watch on youtube.....
i think tht i would be yelling if i was in a cage too
is it just me or do they sound like some of them are screaming "MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
JACK GAP
This is what the Internet was invented for.
2:00 YEEEEEEAH
Where the fuck am I ....
Meh.
Oh man I can't stop laughing at 1:12
HEEEEEELPPP!!!!!
MOOOOOOOM???
ANYBODYYYY???!
transgoat-uality?
Hilarious. XD
Too bad that can't happen. There's nothing like getting stuck in a wrong body, absolutely NOTHING like that.
yeaaaaaaaa. last goat
I've come to a similar thought...

I think I need to go read some tax law or... something smart.
0:24 is hilarious!!!!
2:01 "yeah?"
its a human in a goat body, they are trying to communicate!
Catherine!
hahaha lmao
lol what is wrong with that second last one? :D
1:25 i actually understand the goat better..
I've marked the best parts using up2five. Install the extension, rate and navigate in the video!
1:46 reminds me exactly of Spenny, from Kenny vs. Spenny
2:02 OH MY GOD XD laughed so damn hard
My neighbor has goats... fuck goats!
you're watching a 2 minute video of goats yelling like humans
1:22 This one has Brendan Fraiser's hair cut!
Oh my god. I am dead. I have been laughing for the past 10 minutes, replaying this video. I'm in tears. Every thing hurts. HALP.
1:23 best one
1:45 sounds a bit like my grandpa is falling downstairs... :D
0:24 so thats where Ren's scream came from  lol.
 /watch?v=aBLDUAGsE64
Ahahahaha, foreigners and their pet goats.
Hopefully people know this, but many of these are not goats. 0:21 , 1:12 , 1:37 and 1:59 are actually sheep, and the sounds associated with them are fake.
the last goat is just priceless... but what if they were human once and got cursed into becoming a goat and this is just their way of asking for help.. no? just me? ahahaha.. O_O
O:23 That is NOT a goat, it's a sheep,
Because that phrase comes from the story of the "Boy Who Cried Wolf", and it means that you're deliberately calling a false alarm or you have called a false alarm so many times that nobody believes you when it's the real thing.
I handled the wireless mics at a livestock competition at our fair in Albuqerque. Goats do make some funny sounds. I question if some of the screams are real tho haha.
MOOOOOOOOOOOOM
MOOOOOOOOOOOOM
Press 2 repeatedly. You're welcome.
THE LAST ONE.
1:23 - 1:36 Lost my shit
That Ending LOL
This makes me seriously question why the term is "cry wolf" and not "cry goat"...
I saw clips of this on my local late news tonight and had to check it out.  I reacted just like Jacob Guymon...laughed, gasped, coughed, then cried with hysterics thrown in for good measure.  I'm going to pass this one to many......Thanks, I needed a good belly laugh!
omg i thought i was going to have an aneurysm funniest thing in a long time. And that last one i think was just stupid unreal.
lol pretty sure that one actually wasn't real, sounds like the same guys from /watch?v=nGeKSiCQkPw
the 2nd one killed my sides.
when you think about it, goats are REALLY fucking strange.
the last one was unreal
what if these goats were humans stuck in the body's of goats who just realized what happened to them.
That is so disturbing, like when you hear a fish gasp for air and you can hear their low pitch voices.  It's creepy.
I DID!
The last one is a lamb, doesn't count.
Laughed so hard at 24
1:38 i almost cried
1:24 lol
hahHaha
lol
Lmao the last one... "Eeeaah!"
you can hear someone say "oh my god" after the yell at 0:24
It's almost like someone had the (clearly) magical ability to splice a sound over an image and reproduce it on the intranets as if, you know, someone fucking cared.
PLEASE CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL :)
Sounds like Jerry Seinfeld.
Yeahhhhhh...
0:24   ROFL
1:30 spitting goat was the best
Normal goat: Baaahhh....mmmbbbbhhaaaa....
These crazy ass goats: uuuAAHAHHHH URRRRRRGHHH AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH HUUUUUUUUUUUAHHHHH
I literally cried with laughter at 0:24
Man, I'm at a solid [7] and that just made my night.
It'd be perfect with the business card scene from American Psycho...
Even the dog at the end was confused. LOL
That spitting goat was... indignant!
Someone has to make that video now
Makes me want a goat
00:22 and 1:38 had me laughing, but 1:23 was the BEST!
Maaaaaaaaaa! I almost thought the 3rd goat was missing the top part of its body. Then I realized it was just a big ads black spot. blonde moment!
Creepy...
this might be the funniest video i have ever seen
eh still sounds like a goat
0:24 and 1:39
they're.... evolving... D':
i literally laughed, stopped breathing, coughed, then cried... The 2nd one in was just too unexpected.
can someone please make that come true?
I love this. How can a goat do that? Was a person jammed inside them? And the dog at the end. Oscar for best supporting actor, please. After watching this vid, I had no choice but to compile a video of screaming cats. And chattering cats. And gurgling cats. youtu.be [forward slash] LQQl3TU91fY
i was terrified of goats as a child. if i had ever heard them screaming like this while i was at a petting zoo, i would have totally lost my shit.
I like to imagine they are people trapped in goat bodies
sounds like Obama yelling.
That was the point in which i lost my shit completely, Cant. Stop. Laughing!!!
helllllppppppppppp
HELPPPPP
1:38

OMFG im dying...
Yeah I have a hard time believing the last one is real
the last one said yeahhhhhh...
The dog at the end is all like... "WTF?!?"
that spitting goat is godlike
AKA Congress.
Oh boy lol  its very funny , especially the one that are arguin' with the man
Seems like the one at 0:24 is fake, someone on youtube dubbed over it, if I'm not mistaken.
1:13 DAT QUALITY
Yahoo brought me here. This is a hilarious video!
a sign of the times
Be quiet!  All of ewe!
01:23  brought me to hysterical tears. LOL
doritos ad got it right then !
They're so cute!! 3
The last one fucking got me. Yeah hahahahhahahhahahahahhhahshhshshahshshshshdhjdytewyuj
The one at 1:44 sounds like a confused old man..
... Noone else finds this disturbing...?;___; I'm going to have nightmares now...
does nobody realize the one at :24 is fake?
The one at 24 is fake
The more they hear and listen to humans, the more they try to emulate humans...
The ones at 0:24 and 1:44 sounded the most human. That very last one "Yeahhh" I think actually WAS human, but of course I have no proof.*sigh!*
I can't stop laughing....it hurts so much!!!
Goats are too funny and so chunky :)
Laughing at some silly shit. I wouldn't have missed this, this is two minutes hilarity.
@0:24 LOLOLOLOL
I love the internet...
This is creepy as fuck.
oh like the united stats congress
Halarious!!! Last one is fake though, I helped make it
Booooob! BOOOooOOB!
Ohmyword... This is fantastic.
rapists reincarnate as goats...
You're so fucking original!!!!
This would probably be funnier if I hadn't grown up hearing most of these.
Imagine waking up to the scream of a goat every morning. ..... Yeah, the humor gets swept away pretty quick and the desire to kill kicks in.
0:44 MOMMM!!! Maaaahhm! Maaaa!!!!
@Adam Brown i did it. and it was amazing.
Close your eyes and listen while imagining a bunch of guys in full suits, sitting around a table with briefcases and making these noises
i fuckin cried on the last one oh myg od
0:24 saw lady gaga naked
1:23 lmao! that was highlarious and amazing! that goat seriously had a human soul inside him because he looked like he understood that man. I have never seen anything like this until now. :O
How freaked out would you be if you were walking out alone and heard this without seeing the goat
YeeEAAH! @1:59 LOL!! dogs like WTF??
1:23
over and over again...
"Yeaaaah?"
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Internet.
I have watched this so many times and I'm still peeing myself laughing. Awesome.
At :30, is the awkward guy.
listening to goats yelling like humans
do not watch this video high....lmfao hahahahahah
Quality fakery, my face hurts from the laughing!
Seriously, half of these aren't even goats, they are sheep, do your research! There is also an animal I don't recognize! But not all are goats! Hilarious video though!
Wait...is this real?
nothing wrong with a little sillyness
THEY'RE ACTUALLY PEOPLE TRAPPED IN A GOAT BODY.
Im ackwardly laughing by myself...
Oh my god you are right!
LOL MY SIDES
Ahhhhhhhhhh, ahhhhhhhh first clip
Fake
*baaa*
*baaa*
*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!!*
Holyshit I cant breathe.  I laughed throughout the whole video. Shit is too funny xD
Yeah!
Now I am officially terrified of goats because of this uncanny-valley shit.
This scares the sheeept out of me 0.O
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhh
For some of them, I'm just imagining: "Stop laughing and help me! Someone turned me into a goat!"
The last one wasn't even funny? wtf
omgomg IM DYING LMAO
1:23 LOL
this is just sooooo funny! love them all!
dude is the ending real? WTF?
I think the sound clip for the lamb on the thumbnail is fake.. not to be a hater or anything.. but it sounds too much like a dude yelling. lol
Sounds like a really bad trip.
Seriously where the fuck is Bob?!?
That last one made me laugh so hard!
LMFAO the last one surprised me
WTF Nooch...
Only 0:24 was worth a chuckle.  They got nothing on the Doritos goat.
0:24 Lmfao I busted out laughing
Go home goats your drunk
1:18 I'm pretty sure that's a sheep
Goats smell bad.  I don't understand why jihadis find them so alluring.
"hey hey don't forget me" 1:49
the ones that sound like homer and the very last one are my favorite!
0:23 and 1:20 are the best.
goats are the new cats of youtube.
Ха,ха,ха)))Прикольное видио))
Watched this in my language arts class today xD
last one sounds like he is saying yeah
1:23 thats how me and my girlfriend argue ...
That last one was really disturbing for some reason o_o
WHAT?
@1:25 Cuz stone cold says so.
I laughed so hard! Especially at the end xDDD
this reminds me of the Doritos commercial
I work right next to a high school agriculture area and hear this shit all day. Sometimes I think it really is coming from a dumb ass.
1:16 reminds me of the lady from Tom and Jerry (whose face remains a mystery)whenever she saw Jerry lol
Jimi why....
Holy smokes, that last clip has me rolling! 'Yeaaaaahhhhh'
The one arguing with the guy is an Ibex.
Best part 2:00 - 2:05
BOB! BOB! BOB!
or maybe they are humans i goat's bodies
2:01 yeaaaaaaaaaaah
Lol wtf xD
They never learned how to roll their A's
Holy shit is that Eddie Murphy? 0:23
Why is Jimmy Hendrix masturbating to goats.....?
What a strange world.
You owe me a new glass of water and a new keyboard.
1:19 give him his doritos back!
LMAOOOOO
Oh internet... you never cease to amuse me.
Planet of the Goats, anyone?
You've goat to be kidding me
You're "kidding" me, right?  :))))))
Tears. Streaming.
My mom thinks i'm watching weird porn.
I think the one in the barn speaks Yiddish.
The best thing about the last one is the Alsatian in the background. He's just thinking "what the hell is going on?"
And this is why I love youtube so much
That is just the best.
these goats should make a music compilation.
HELP...They CHANGED ME!!!
If I'm correct the lamb at the end said yeah if like he were drunk
1:22-1:36 really hilarious
1:20  Homer Simpson!
Ahhh
Yeeeaahhhh
nope!
Fake?

^^
The one after the baby one looked like a dinosaur haha
the second one would be terrifying at night
lol I would go crazy if I had to live on a farm ahahah
Hahaha damn! Although they do sound distressed :/
hahaha 0:23
Little bit of wee came out.
some of the yells remind me of ha-ra-buh-jee (korean old man) grunt and yell.
I thought you were dead!
1:26 i cannot stop laughing at that.
I showed this to my cat and my cat just yawned.
lol........so true.
1:23

F U too, goat!
why would it?  they're tasty.
(0:45) MOM,......MOM......MOM.
Lmao 1:25
The last goat absolutely killed me!
Thanks a lot. Because of all of that loud screaming, everyone in my house thought I was watching torture porn. It was incredibly awkward having to explain that I was masturbating to a video with screaming goats in it.
not supposed to be OMG LOOK IS REAL

just supposed to be funny. obviously its fake.
1:26 that an Ibex
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG ROFLMAO......... That goat at :22 seconds was the BEST!!!!! Hahahahahaha FRIKIN HILARIOUS!!!!!! "AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!"
Lmfao! The goat at 1:25, has THE deadest stare! "Like bitch, do you know who the fuck you're talkin' to like that?!" XD the spit, was a nice touch as well. LOL
0:26 made me laugh hard
These goats will never get laid.
HAHAHAHAHA
watch?v=Dp0Bt2cbcc8
Pretty sure that the last one scarred me for life
"MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM"
most of these goats are dead.... sorry about ruining your day
The one at 45 seconds sounds like Pee Wee Herman!
IT'S THE PEE WEE HERMAN GOATS!! AAAAAH AAAAAH AAAHH HA HA
1:32 the goat said "fuck"..
que chistoso no sabia que las cabras podian gritar aci jajajaja
Plol
Just give them back their damn Doritos!!!
Wilhelm is a great name for a goat.
the last one was 'YEAAAHHHH"
Thanks, M.A. Larson
1:38 - Don't mind us, we're just being goats. Baaa.
1:41 - Ahhhhhhh, holy fuck, it's Justin Bieber! Runnnn!

Thank you so much for this. It's pretty hilarious.

0:24 AH-MAZING
OMG! The second to last one sounds like a drunk man!!!! xD
I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!
I kept looping at 1:23 That is too funny! :D
HAHAHA!! Made my day!
Though I think a couple of those were dubs, still really funny.
0:23 Greatest of all time
G.O.A.T.

This is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:23 LMFAOOO IM DEAD
Reminds me of "The Bane" from Borderlands 2.
1:23-1:36....arguing with a creationist
new perfect place to commit murder: goat farm
All types of human emotions..anger, laughter, pain, fear &....orgasm...lol ;-)
Sounds like my exgirlfriend.  Almost as hairy too.
ha ha you really stuck it to 'em! Get that low hanging fruit!
Greatest thing since Birds that can curse!
that's some scary ass shit!!!
0:44

Bob! Bob!
01:37 is definitely the best
i warned them not to feed the goats the cheaper genetically altered carrots and oats but they refused to listen
Right? That's the best one, haha!
0:50: MAAAAAAMMMMMM....... MMMAAAOOOOOMMMM
this is exactly what you hear when you go to a justin bieber concert or a twilight movie premier.
2:03 was the freaking highlight of my day
omg copy this url and paste it in a new browser. then you'll have twice as many screaming goats! fucking awesome!
the one at :43 sounds like pee-wee herman
Press the 4 key, then the 2 key. Suspiciously similar...
Wow the goat at the end sounded like it said yeah
1:16 killed me
lmao I don't like goats but that was funny!
goats are very tasty too
Keep pressing 2 key. Just don't waste anymore beer
I was just laughing but then I completely lost it with the goat at 1:24.
God, what messed up creatures.
gay goat 0:32! LOL
1:23 "suck my dick"
My cats freak out when I play this clip!  Great!
I make the same sounds after a few shots
MOOOOM! MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM! MOM!
The last one... "Gyeahhhhhh."
@1:24 i died, my stomach hurt from laughing haha faack
Some of these are sheep!
2nd one... so the superbowl commercial with the screaming goat was real?
Why?
words not even fit for a public bathroom wall....but, at least, the video was funny
i love the one that goes gaaaaaahhhhhhh the others are just meh
きっと人間が中に入っている。 amo
I don't think you know the difference between goats and sheep, hahaha
two minutes will never be enough
AAAAAAAH!  UUUUUUGH!
This is getting my wholehearted "dislike"
that nigga at 1:47 is on some Larry David shit
Yeeeaaah!
it's like listing to a bunch of drunk frat boys.
Na mate. It's absolutely shite.
I assume by "gay" you mean fabulous, right? Cause this is.
I'm going to be a goat farm when I grow up
1:15...shall be my pet
Last one is best
"Mommmmmmmm!  Mooooooooom! Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
^^^ seething
0:23 made me spit my beer all over my computer screen!!
Quit sharing your relationship statuses on here
Fake and gay
Whoever voted this down is nuts
0:24 is my favorite xD new ringtone anyone?
Pay no mind to the others, I get what you mean.  :p
1:39 is the killer =))
2nd sheep is hilarious, but fake :(
Wilhelm Goats
I opened this in a new tab and i thought i had a porn pop up
if u people keep talkin about those awful movies they will keep being popular, u people made justin bieber popular.
Please make another Doritos commercial with these guys.
1:23 was my fav. lmaoooo
The dog says, "woof"
The duck says, "quack"
The cow says, "moo"
The sheep says, "whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"
It has to resemble a love story for that tired joke to work, genius.
1:39 my personal favourite
Second sheep is best sheep
Second one made me bust a gut xD
Chewing on, yes.  Eating, no.  Goats are super fussy eaters, but they like chewing on stuff.  They are super curious, and they don't have useful hands so their mouth is the way they interact with everything.  Goats aren't really that into sweets. Even sweet feed is molasses and tastes very different from processed sugar.
THAT SECOND SHEEP THO XDDDD
A lot of these are sheep.
There sheep
1:23 Fuc*ing awesome xD
Some of these are definitely fake but still funny 
look at 0:22 and 1:14 sound familiar?
Also, do you think this is really what a sneeze sounds like? 1:23
Think about how good blr is, it shouldn't be that hard to make realistic goat yelling like human noises. 
Made me laugh a lot though haha
The one at  0:22 and I shared the same sound during his monologue
why... can't I stop watching this? ...!!??!!??
County fair when I was about 7 yrs old. Had a bag of cotton candy. At the goat pen I felt a tugging on the bag. I think the goat was more interested in eating the bag than the cotton candy.
try to watch this while you're eating
The one at 0:25 is fake because the background noise cuts out then it plays a scream that is used in other videos.
The last was the best! =)
lol!
this is why i don't ask goats for their opinions anymore
I snorted for real.  I'm at work and my coworkers came in to see what my "laugh attack is about."
Mode 7, more like Goat Heaven.
Sounds like the bidder's assistants on Barrett-Jackson.
goats gonna goat
Even if this is fake something about is still funny
air 

need air

cant breathe
playing 0:25 in loop hahahahahaha oh godddddd
I love u internet !!!!
"What do you think about Zapatero's [Spanish former PM] government?" *spits*

"yeahhhhh." best part (the last one). the dogs face is amazing 1:59
hahaha 1:22 . It's like the ghost of an anti-social teenager has possessed the goat.
second one LOL
probably best video on youtube
Still a better love story than Twilight
Dingle berry
Damn! Lyn Cassady's method has some serious side effects.
At 1:40 I completely lost it
Lol I like the brown one
HAHAHAHA !
If your name is Matt, never visit a farm with sheep or goats.  It will lead to years of your sisters calling you "MAA-A-A-A-A-A-ATT".
Years.
Lol sounds so fucking hilarious
fake
Fake?
nigger sounds like HOMER
Russel Howard
Am I a failure at animal identification 101, or are 0:21 and 1:15 actually sheep?
That last one though LOL and the way the dog looked after he said it!!!! LOL
See THIS is why you should always puff some buds before going to the zoo.

This is strangely disturbing.
These must be the Luciano Pavarotis of the Goat Kingdom.
Whiteboy7strt would like this ahhahaha
вас наслушаются животные как вы проводите время на сеновале,и повторяют за вами:)
I'm pretty sure the goat at 01:46 is speaking Farsi
SO! FUNNY!
I nearly suffocated! Hilarious
pause @2:03 
stormtrooper
miért van ilyen hanguk? ez valami rendellenesség?
He was interviewing the goat about an old Spanish ruler, an old comment said that and I can't find it now.
2nd one is fake clearly
This has to be one of my favourite videos of all time
hl 2 zombie sounds!
THEY'RE PEOPLE!!!!!! PEEEEOPLLLLLEEEE!!!!!!!!!
That was so fun!!!! 1:23 - 1:38
Why was that guy interviewing a goat?
Nintendo's voice actors for Zelda Skyward Sword ?! xDD
In fact that one in 0:44 sounds like it's yelling "Help!" :)
That goat had a long goatie.
But clearly not unscreamable things
I just died
Genuinely curious: Which ones are fake, and how can you tell?
Too many fakes... But the real ones are hilarious!
I do not recommend watching this at work... be prepared for 00:24
0:24 I actually spit up my water
I want that one from 0:21 !!!!!!!!!!!!
That dog looked so confused at the end
WHAT IF THEY’RE PEOPLE TRAPPED IN GOATS BODIES TRYING TO SCREAM FOR HELP!
1:45 sounds like a nursing home
BISA DIEM GAK SIH???
@markk217 errr. goats
Right On!!hahaha
Spit in yo f'ing face negga.
1:45 sounds like me, when i am drunk and have locked up myself in the bathroom.
These goats have seen things... Unspeakable things...
I'm pretty sure a few of these were fake but the video was still awesome
Idiots. It's fake
Word Life
faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaakeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee...
@1:24 what a jerk
xD
You forgot the best goat of all, Chicken Goat.

at Wimp dot com/chickengoat
ooooh! oh I'm dying, this is so fucking funny!!
this reminds me of Pinocchio
any1 went in to help
Primus were right.  Animals should not try to act like people.  But I'm sure glad in this instance that they did. Especially 0.25.
Lmao!!!
That last one was made by Dayjob Orchestra.
I bet the one at 0:27 is going through puberty.
Is there something wrong with them?
O MY GOD! WE TOOK TOO MUCH ACID!
I laughed so hard I was sobbing. Why don't MY goats sound like yelling men?
Just an FYI, that "Yeah" at the very end is actually faked, as amusing as it is.
it's actually an ibex! :)
worldoftanks
1:24 IS THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE
The screaming ones and the last one are I'm pretty sure.
I worked on a sheep farm once. This is real shit. There was one sheep that literally sounded like a guy with a deep voice very casually and calmly stating "Bah. Bah. Baah? Baah."
Oh God the last one
I can't
He just
"Yeaaah"
I fucking lost it at the last one.
are some of these fake?
Hit '8', best part of the video.
The second goat.  Is that really him/her yelling?  I swear it's a soundover HAHAHAHA
this video is god's gift to humanity
the second one cracked me up
THEY FORGOT HOW TO GOAT!
YEEAAH!!
its scary to me why is the one that spit so mad ill put his ass so sleep before he hurt someone wow this is so crazy shit
are these real?
Oh my gosh those people have been turned into goats! Will somebody please help them!
Fucking badass warrior goats at 01:37

Metal.
1:39
:o
1:12; best yell.
They say help
Goats sound remarkably similar to drunk college kids at 4 AM.
HAHA SO FUNNAY COMMENT U CLEVER XDDDDDD shut the fuck up and die
Hilarious
Is this real
Very weird, but I couldn't stop laughing.
2:00 YEEEEEAH!
HELP ME

I'M DYING OF LAUGHTER

HELP ME
omg it hurts so much laughter
My favorite part was when the goat yelled like a human.
Goats are rad as fuck.
The one that spits reminds me of the arab I buy my smokes from.
Found a new ringtone.
Oh I fucking lost it at that goat.
this is the fucking best thing to have ever existed XD
me too....
now... what would happen if we went around doing that as goats??
MAAAA!   Maaaaa!   

Where's their mother, anyway?
Ted Nugent should have been included in this compilation.
The last one is fake as fuck
I'm pretty sure they're mocking us....
:23 lmfao
Lost it at 1:45
01:40 fake
I thought the same thing....
0:24-0:26 is fake. you can here the superimposed audio clip in/out.
The goat in 1:24 is being questioned about Zapatero, the former spanish Prime Minister. Even goats have a remarkable opinion :D
And where do you think they got those sounds from? Seriously, is it really that hard to think?
When I shoot Goats in Skyrim, with my bow, They don't Yale like that... So Sad and so boring...
except you're wrong...download Soundtrack Pro by Apple...most of these are stock sounds pulled from that software
This is only funny to people who haven't used Apple's Soundtrack Pro...it's mostly stock audio folks.
Went from worst valentines day ever to best cause if this, thanks :3
I think I just shat myself from laughing so hard. FUCKING AMAZING!
No me he reido mas en mi vida
1:38 I didn't expect that one...
Emaaaakkkk!!!!
The high pitched one and the last one are fake.
i cant stop replaying 1:45
The new Wilhelm scream: 0:24.
Then were two :P OMG!! Die EVERYTIMEE :P
1:24 HAHAHAHAHAH
hilarious!!
Ma*
it sounds like they are all yelling "mom!!"
I keep feeling that the goat is going to rip off its head revealing a mans face.
I DIED AT 1:24
ba.
jajajajajjajajaa!
1:40 

Sounds like two guys charging into a  battlefield or something. . .XD
1:58
Omg I love the second one
THIS IS GOLD.
niggoat
2:01 even the dog was like 'the fuck..?'
im scared of goats now XD
sounds like my ex-wife, lol.
2:01 was the one i was least expecting lmao
Lmao. Just goats having fun.
1:24 -> fuq da poliec
1:44 is the funniest!
i cant stop laughing :DD
And I'm gay , he can shoot his load on my body with that noise ;)
1:24 that goat... I can't even handle it.
The third one gave up on life.
I could watch the second goat over and over again.
The guy cleaning up the goat poop in the first one must hate his life
I make sounds like the 3rd one.
Introducing Goat Super heroes. Lol
the second one is a sheep, just fyi.
i had to stop watching half way through because my throat was hurting too much from laughing...
Damn witches, turning good folks into goats!!!!
Sometimes mother nature has a nasty kind of humor!
hahahahhaha
It's Po-Zest  AAhhhh
1:12 he sounds like the Doritos goat, wow im so easily amused
what am i doing with my life? :S
It's just that I've seen goats up close and the one that I saw with no horns usually had nubs on their heads were their horns would be.
I love that last one "Yeaaaah."
thanks mittzie
I don't care about your private life, or what his name is.  I'm here to see goatse!

. . .no wait.
1:23 is so funny! The goat goes.. Huh?
Noh.
0:25 LAUGHED HARD OMG XD
most of these are sheep not goats...
Yeaaaaaaaaaaaah!... [smile]
Not sure what you mean about the "homeless goats" bit, but I'm pretty sure some species of goats just don't grow horns. /female goats don't usually grow horns.
I still don't understand this... those hornless goats, are their horns removed or is it genetics that keeps them from growing horns?
On Valentine's day
The last one says yeah
It's 5pm, I'm hungry and I just tried clicking on the '2:30' to see what part of the vid you mean
The one at 1:03 reminds me of Ladder Goat
A bunch of them ain't goats. Must be a video compilation made by a city slicker. Look up the definition of sheep. LOL
The Men (and Women) Who Stare At Goats.
And we thought black people came from monkeys...
Так вот кто под окнам у нас по ночам орет!
Chicken nuggets at 2:30? Let me guess, other symptoms are bloodshot eyes and cotton mouth?
You jelly?
Because about half of those clips are fake :)
The second one, and the ones at 1:22 and 1:40, as well as the last one are all sheep...
*SPTOO* OOOUUURGH!!!

That goat doesn't mince words.
На 1:20 Это что-то!
Creio que seja um processo de mutação genética, onde as cabras se tornaram em algo maior que os humanos e nós humanos entraremos em extinção... Planeta das Cabras.
0:47 is yelling "mom"
And I love how in the last one, even the dog behind tilts its head as if to say: "Whoah, wtf!? Did he... did he just say that!?"
The one that sounds like Homer Simpson [1:16] is my all-time favourite. Oh, and the goat that keeps going: "WHHAAAAA!?" whenever the guy on camera speaks Spanish to him.
I think its enough youtube for today.
BEST VID ON YOUTUBE
Claro!
i lost it at 0:22 xDDDDD
Last one was like patrick star
eah
0:22 and 1:38 lmao
best scream at 1:38 ... I almost fall from my chair
IM SHITTING BRICKS!!!! :D :D :D: :D: D: D:D:D
Cara, não pode ser verdade...
I imagine them yelling "HELP I'VE TURN INTO A GOAT".
what.... even.... how did I get here...
Only the BEST LIFE EVER.
naaaah can't be
sounds like my mom
awesome, your. life. is awesome!
0:23 is the best
And the best video we ever will watch.
It is wonderful.
The goats ate the souls of farmers who raised them. This is a collection of the farmers screaming for mercy.
oh my god I almost died!! XD 0:25! I'm sick and I started coughing after I lol'd, it was hard to stop and I almost puked. XD gross..
I'm stuck in the loop from 1:24 to 1:36 and tears are rolling down my eyes.... the more i watch it the funnier it gets.
let this be real 
i need this to be real
except it's actually real and awesome.... moron
0:24 is a sheep lol
hey me too! nuggets rock
1:41 is just outrageous because there's a bunch of normal sheep making normal sheep sounds and then they just get yelled at in response. So awesome.
pmsl  the ones at 0.25 and 1.22 woooooo! sounds like they are yelling out like when your on a rollercoaster lol, enjoying themselves
O.o best comment i've read all  night XD
OK. The final goat was the best.
this is so fake and gay and fake and gay
it's 2:30 am and i'm eating chicken nuggets and watching videos of goats screaming 

what is my life
All I can think about at the first one is ozzie osbourne shouting SHAAARONN lol
"MOOOOOOOOOM!"
Goats aren't yelling. Humans are yelling in reality!
they're asking for help!
Yeeah
HELLA FAKE
first one is the best
O MG- That is the funniest thing ever.
Why am I watching this...
1:40 literally made me fall over laughing
1:40 has to be fake hahahhahahahaha
1:44 What? What? WHAT? what? WhAt? What?
i am full of meem
WRAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUH
1:23 and the one after it are my favorite ones xD
lol at the end. the dog's like, "the fuck?"
AHHHHHHHHH!
the goat at 1:44 sounds like a confused old man.
Best video ever.
OH MY GOD at the beginning i was thinking wtf those people need to shut up and it was the goat... omfg
sweet!
The best video I have ever watched
2:03 .... HHHHMMMYEAH!
*SPIT*  RAAAAAAHHHHHHH
00:15 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA I DIED
But do any of them selectively cutout background noise? None that I'm aware of do.
That is wonderful.. <3 I'm not kidding.
This changes everything.
they sound like pee-wee herman
"Boooob!"
MOMMMMMM!
I have a cow named Jairo
1:24 Anyone notice that the goat is saying, "What?!" Clearly he does not understand the language of your people, fast-talking foreign man.
some girl posted the same exact comment this morning lol, weird....
1:28 is where it gotz realz 4 me
Only on fucking Tumblr.
Can't stop laughing. xDD
I just found my new ASMR video, amazing

Hahahahah!! AHH MY BELLY!! XD
You're absolutely right, no two animals have ever sounded the same in history. Its just preposterous!
1:23 the goat : pff what what what ahh what
0:53 boooooooooooooooooooooooooob!
My parents thought I was watching violent porn
This should be nominated for an Oscar.
1:23. that goat's a king.
I'm literally in tears oh my god
fake and gay.
0:23 and 1:16 are identical.
1:23
Saved the best for last for sure
1:23 LOL
But I lost it a 1:24...
damn, I'm lost again on youtube..
This is the hardest I've ever laughed.
was about to say the exact damn thing, it's fucking hilarious rofl.
THE LAST ONE
the one at .50 sounds like he's saying "Mommmm!"
I had to stop drinking my water because I started choking.
the goat in the green jacket is like im trying to be like the others but I CANT
2:00. Lost it.

1:34 what'd you say bitch!?
I am laughing so hard.

MAAAA! THE MEATLOAF!

wat the fuck! this is scary
Yeaah
Word sista
Absolutely hilarious.
sounds like a dude yelling for his mom
That second one, the goat behind the fence, could cause a lot of problems, what if someone called the cops because they thought someone was being murdered or something
Some microphones are designed to cut out background noise, including ones in cameras.
; ^ ;
Sadly/luckily, they changed this. Those depend more on what you watch now. You might have listened to something by fleetwood mac or watched another video from the same uploader.
Youtube's top recommended video for this is Fleetwood Mac's "Go You Own Way".
0:49 an instant classic ^^
Lost it at 1:14 omg
1:21 OH. MY. HOLY. TARDIS. I'm dying xD

0:30 the gay goat
Why the fuck did 9gag take me here
Cracked is terrible. 
By the way, where do you think your profile image was made? Cracked? Funny.
HOLY SHIT, GOATS
1:45 sounds like a retarded 17 year old
This was on Cracked. 

Why the fuck did this have to be posted on /b/ of all fucking places? Cue 12 year olds making "mods are fags" jokes and other inane BS.

Fucking niggers.

2:00 yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
1:23 that goat takes no shit.  I literally died.  

That goat is my new master
Um, llamas don't have horns. Goats are as capable of spitting in your face a llamas, though not known for it.
omg gaots
I was browsing le 9gag when I suddenly heard this, didn't know what to do LOL! #YOLO
I'm a goat and what is this...
The first one kinda sounds like porn.
HOW DO GOATS EVEN EXIST OMG
he's asking the goat about their actual president (españa) and then he agrees with the goat. yep
0:28 2 stupid dogs sound
SOUNDED LIKE A CHICK GETTIN DICKED BY A GOAT
This explains everything
lol 1:44 sounds like me, when i burned my tongue XD
so much fake
1:40 oh my sides
0:22 he realized he is a goat.
This is what happens when you die. You don't go to hell. Your soul is placed into a goat and you're surrounded by ugly people.
So this is the reason my mom keeps trying to convince my dad to buy her a goat for Valentine's day...
He's asking to the lama (yeah, goats don't spit at your face) what he thinks about Zapatero's government, and other political stuff.
OH GOD MY SIDES XDDDDDDDDDD
1:37
the real ones could be funny, if most weren't so obviously fake and gay
My face hurts now, fuck you goats!
what is the spanish man yelling?
fuck you moot
fags
Op is a faggoat.
1:13 i had to stop here. i can't laugh and ruminate at the same time
1:45 "NO, I'm TELLING you man I'm NOT a goat! Just LISTEN to me. Here man, look. its the water, MAN the fucking WATER. Let me show you this shit, look..."
fuck you m00t
1:44 LOLED HARD
>mfw 4chan plants his own flag in Youtube
You should find one that shouts "NO! NO! NO!" all the time.
Le 9gag army has arrived!
HAS SCIENCE GONE TO FAR?
holy fuck i cant stop laughing
1:59: ... YEAH.
I love the dogs face at the end lol.
Tell me Clarice. Hannibal
Eu tenho uma vaca chamada jairo
The one at 1:41 sounds like gilbert gottfried
FAKE
1:25 The man is arguing with a fucking GOAT! xD
Oh god, the second one had me in absolute bits.
Oh gosh I needed this so much today.
You know some weird humans!
My brain when I do an oral report.
1:22 FTW!
1:44 - 1:57 Dee Fizzy's Grampa Voice goat.
Most of the sheep clips are dubbed. Sorry to spoil the fun.
1:24 -  1:35 Pissing myself...
Some of these are fake. The last video is even here on YouTube and the lamb doesn't say "yeah!" like that in the original version, lol. Some of these are real, some of them are dubbed.
Most YouTube videos I see everyone is shouting "fake" in the comments section, even when the clip is real. Then I watch this and everyone is taking about crying tears of laughter when most (not all) of these really ARE faked. You can even hear loads of edit points in the soundtrack (everyone's favorite at 1:20 is a dub of a man fake screaming). Judging by the likes, this has fooled a lot of people......
why isnt this a meme
That's dubbed. Most of these are.
A fair proportion of these are dubbed. Disappointed.
It's funny, but some of then are fake.
1:18 I am crying with laughter
Digital Spy?
BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
i'm not worried
From laughing!
I am dying
You start screaming when you wake up?
perhaps one of the greatest compilations of all time
Кто знает. Сколько надо его пиздить чтобы начал разговаривать?
LOL
0:48 ...BOB????
:22 is fake... you can hear the sound clip edit and background noise disappear.
Maybe humans yell like goats. Ever think of that?
1:23 I lost my shit..
JAIRO ME TROUSE AQUI
ахах,сцуки смешно горлапанят
Ебааать!!!!11 Лучше бы они так не делали!
Tenho uma vaca chamada Jairo!
So this is where the yelling in cartoons is dubbed from... XD
Okay, I think that's enough internet for today.
:24 is Homer simpson
me too :P
preciso comprar uma cabra
this gives my life meaning.
TUMBLR BROUGHT ME HERE
oh god, they're so special :D
2.01 Jeeah! And the dog is like dafuq?
Vaca Jairo aprova esse vídeo
what kind of dog is this?
smoke some and than watch this :-D
Ive hear sheeps that are yelling like humans before. Allmost every single day.
2:00 YEEEEEAHHH!!!
1:23 I think the interviewer said something REALLY REALLY offensive for a goat... Oo
Whoever did this had a problem!
0:44 SOMEONE KNOWS WHERE IS BOB?
Some of these are clearly sheep.
sadpokdsapokdsaokdsaopsdka... chorei mano
Is this fake? it gotta be
0:44 potato, is that you? :o
My mental sanity is doubtful, I can't stop laughing at this. Am I the only one??? Baaaa?
ah negão!!!! sempre me surpreendendo
Which ones were fake?
Well, it looks like the lambs couldn't be silenced.
well, i didn't laugh... stupid video
0:25 :DDDDDDDDDD
Three of them were fake. But the rest were real.
The screen at 1:35 i thought that was a human screaming o.o
yeah
02:00 YEEAH.
All the sheep ones are fake and all the goat ones are real. So stupid.
Some of them are fake....like that. Sounds just like some kinda singer.
At 1:25, I would have punched one on the face
Some of them were sheep though.

And the one at 1:49 was totally in heat XD My goat does that sometimes when she's in heat
My sides are hurting since i saw this last night and now i've watched it again i'm in twice as much pain.The best compilation video i've seen in ages.Love them goats.
I can't breathe, call a doctor
This is the best Chris Tucker stand up routine I've ever seen.
I've struck gold
1:09 that goat just asked what can I do for you in a british accent O.o like look at his mouth even >.< haha
that goat behind the fence: heeeelp! Then two goats sound like sheep and then human. :D
THIS is literally the best thing ive seen all day
Findance ;)
0:22 ...Homer?
YEAAH
Me neither xD ''AAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHH'
Hahaha =D
I'm surprised that goat did not wear a helmet. 1:44
So who else was totally not expecting 1:40 to sound the way it did lmfao
The last one says "Yeahhhh"? Now I wish a goat would copy the "Won't Get Fooled Again" scream.
Maybe? How about definitely! Listen to those clearly human pleas! Now someone call 911 and get the transmogrification rescue patrol on the case right away! ... 'Who ya gonna call?' 'Goat busters!' ... 'I ain' 'fraida no goats...'
Probably
Goats Will Rise, and then yell at you and sort of complain about everything.
here, let me give you a +1 thumbs up
You left out the Jerry Lewis Goat.....search it
I thought I heard a little bit of patrick star in that last one
actually laughed til i cried, so great
Best ending. "YEEEEAAAH."
The second one tho
1:24 is the best - having an argument with a goat lol
WHY ARE WE ALL YELLING? No tumblr no
omg tumblr why.
Imagine if in every single one of those human-sounding goats, a human is actually in there. The possibilities are endless; reincarnation, brain transplant, a ton of acid.
Translation at 1:23:
Man:  Okay so I want to take a moment to talk about the goat. 
Goat/Lover: *spit* GOAT?!
Man: *Throws up hands*  What do you want from me?  We agreed on camera we...
Goat/Lover: what?!
Man:  We agreed that...
Goat/Lover: WHAT?!
Man: We agreed that we wouldn't take our love public.
