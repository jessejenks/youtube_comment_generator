Frustrated, degraded, down before you're done
Rejection, depression, can't get what you want
You ask me how I make my way
You ask me everywhere and why
You hang on every word I say
But the truth sounds like a lie

Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall

Obsessive, compulsive, suffocate your mind
Confusion, delusions, kill your dreams in time
You ask me how I took the pain
Crawled up from my lowest low
Step by step and day by day
'Till there's one last breath to go

Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall

Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in
Let another round begin, live to win
Yeah, live, yeah, win

Live to win, 'till you die, 'till the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all, just keep fighting till you fall

Day by day, kickin' all the way, I'm not cavin' in
Let another round begin, live to win
Live to win
Live to win
Yeah, live, yeah, win
Sounds like generic 80's movie soundtrack music.  Love that guitar he's using.

LOVE THIS SONG ?
WOHOOO
Paul Stanley is my best idol! His voice ... his stage presence ... the guy is incomparable! The best at it! Paul Stanley my master! Paul Stanley my inspiration! It's just the guy I am inspired!
Heard a short part of this song during another video here on Youtube. The part was just like 5 to 10 seconds long but I could immediately guess that this was Paul Stanley's voice. His voice might have changed over the decades but it's still easily recognisable.
How do you kill that which has no life? just train with this song!!!
This song makes me want to kill boars.
Vive Alphacast !
Me when i play xenoblade chronicles x
Just found some interesting trivia: one of Paul's favourite artists is the Bronx prodigy, singer/songwriter Laura Nyro, who he listens to "incessantly". Paul and Nyro are both of Jewish heritage and both attended the Manhattan High School of Music and Art: both were accepted for their art prowess, but ended up recording stars. Paul graduated in 1970, the same year Nyro was given special recognition by the High School for her success as a recording artist. Also, Paul co-wrote this song with Desmond Child, who is also a huge Laura Nyro fan. See Nyro's induction into the Rock Hall of Fame in 2012 by Bette Midler (wonderful). Paul thinks its more appropriate that Nyro¬†be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame since her music isn't strictly rock. Nyro is actually unique, and is one of the most¬†revered artists by other artists in the music industry. She is legendary. A phenomenal talent.

Hate the fact that most, if not all, the audience are only there because of that band he's in!! I wouldn't pay one cent to see THAT band but I like Paul Stanley's material...or at least most of it. I just could not STAND to sit through a rehashed 2 hours of make-up rubbish with that megalomanic Mr. $$$$$$$$immons at the helm!!! What a waste of space and a joke that man is!! Paul Stanley should grow up and leave him behind for GOOD!!!!!!!!

even if it was used in south park its still very good song
You don't reply to others like that
gud1
Seriously guys, let's do a little demographics count here.
Like this comment if South Park brought you here. If it didn't dislike it (don't stay neutral!) so we'll at least have a slight idea of how much this song got more popular thanks to South Park.
Lol
@toastmansride Not if you don't ever play MMORPG's.
I play this in the background when I level up on Halo: Reach.
Jovem Nerd me trouxe aqui

How do you kill one that has no life?
Is that the Filllmore? I was at that show. The back-up band are the guys from Rockstar:Supernova.
unfortunately, one of the side-effects of bath salts is Paul Stanley...
paul stanley is severus snape :D
I'm here because of Jesse Cox oddly enough
i must kill more boars
I just carried myself from 1000 elo to 1200 with no help, this song is how i felt and how i feel now. YESSS

South Park Brought me here
Wow, I guess he doesn't need makeup to look like a tranny
nope its an amazing song
its one of those under rated songs
so many boars were killed because of this song.
This is charlie sheen's theme song!
You claim to be innocent, but that thumbnail leads to me to believe otherwise.
i am here cause of south park
same reason why I gave him a thumbs up too XD
–°–µ—Ä–∏—è 10-08, Make Love, Not WarCraft <3
how can a video this epic get only 458 thousand views?
You cant. But the thing you can do is wipe it out of existence.
You could throw a ball around outside all day... Or you can sit at your computers and do something that matters!
I don't know what this says, but it's probably really inspirational!
How do you kill that which has no life?
ahh bring'm southpark and wow fans together.shit.
Cartmaaaan !
This is my favorite song to train

words of a thousand truths!
South park!!
haha it said in the series but when you play now that thing is worth dirt...
No i came here from patrick
South park brought me to " live to win " and " push it to the limit "  xD
Jesus christ, we get, you're here from South Park.
No i'm here because of South Park
That was such Iberia pwnge
south park reference.
what is wrong with you
South Park, that is all.
What advertisments?
I turn my ad-blocker on so scumbag vevo doesn't get money
dad, get off our team speak line
58 people arent living to win
its a mmorpg im playing with people from all over the world and getting xp with mi friends using teamspeak
Let's be 'original'...
Thumbs up if South Park DIDN'T brought you here. (Not really asking for thumbs up, but if you really like the comment, give it one or two. ^_^ )
the sword of a thousand truths!
Yes. 65,340,285, which should take us 7 weeks, 5 days, 13 hours and 20 minutes, giving ourselves 3 hours a night to sleep.
I've had this song in my head for a while now, glad I finally found it xd
Do you know how may boars we would have to kill to gain 30 levels?
Totally copying aXLiitY's comment here. 
FUCK OFF THUMBWHORE
thumbs up if you have thumbs
thumbs up if South Park brought you here
Du bon song super chanson
Apples
i just watched this while soloing a normal game on lol!
He didn't ask for those thumbs up, you stupid motherfucker.
South Park Warcraft
Lol king
Thumbs up if you're watching this video on youtube...
Mom need more hot pockets!
this should be my theme song -.-
i just listened to it , while I'm killing the boars in the forest...
he said "made me" meaning he only looked at the results of the math, meaning the way to get results culd have been with a multipler
you crazy man :o
you're the prefect shit
But you cant look at it like that. He was talking about percents, not units, which means that you have to add the 20% not multiply them. I am crying at your lack of math skills. Oh, and for the records, one cannot be 0% cool unless ones youtube name is loganstone.
depends if you look at it with a multipliar and basing the added 20% on the results of that. DUH
If he is 0% cool out of 100% cool, it means that he is 20% cool. Duh...
Forever alone..
I allways hear this song when I play WoW
54 :)
51 people dont live to win
instant thumps up for your comment
psssh. Do Inferno, bro.
20% of 0 is still 0
INSTAND THUMPS DOWN U COMMENT =D
WTF me too lol but on inferno
So, wow, way to freak out. Its clear you just said it for the thumbs up, so dont try to call me out when you were doing something petty. If you play casually, which is fine, why even point it out? it sounds like you were trying to sound superior because you beat something slightly difficult.
gay live
Really now? God damn you hordes are ANNOYING!
Yes they did it in elwynn forest.
GuardsmanBob brought me here.
Elwynn forest init? I believe they did in Elwynn Forest atleast, starting area for humen xD I forgot they used it in Southpark untill someone mentioned it lol
Thats not that hard
Shove those thumbs up your asshole, you annoying prick.
FOR THE HORDE
Me 2 +
this song motivated me
To test if you play wow, What forest? You should know if you even watched the south park episode because they tell the name of it.
I wish that there would be an 10h version of this song here in YouTube :D i've listened this about 100 times this evening and i'm still not bored!
I have Season 10 of South Park on DvD so I listen to this all the time hahaha
thumbs up if you know this song for being a kiss fan !
SOUTH PARK MAKE LOVE NOT WARCRAFT!! <3
53 persons were killed by an overpowered player!
Love this song :)
"¬°¬°SHIT TO WIN!!"

Thumbs up if you know this song from South Park:D(Make love not Warcraft episode)
I listen to this while picking up chicks and dealing with them rejecting me at the beginning of my pickups
MOM! MORE HOTPOCKETS!!!
Snape what are you doing here ? Go back to Hogwarts.
Omg his voice is trashed.
i cant focus on video while fucking nicki minaj is staring at me..
Fuck off YouTube, I don't want to buy Nicki cunting Minaj's new album. I'm here to get inspired by Paul fucking Stanley.
i play wow :P and i like the south park episode
Well first i did
Best episode of South Park in my opinion, I don't even play wow
I remember the first time I listend to this song here on youtube, I was a fresh kiss fan. I thought to myself: This Paul Stanley guy is a great singer, I should listen to his songs as well. So I checked the wikipedia to see what ealse he does, and thought to my self: F*ck!
You know, I red your comment, and than said to my self: ok, lets read what the other guy said. And when I did, youtube respond: "comment no longer exist". So congratulations, the guy did what you suggested XD.
I don't always live...but when I do...I live to win.
this shud have way more views!?
THIS VIDEO DESERVE SO MANY MORE VIEWS !!!!!!
MOAR HOTPOCKETS!
Good Motto to Live By
agreed
yea, garrosh fucked the horde up badly, thrall will kick his ass though. and in mop he'll be the final boss as far as i know (i am honestly kind of new at wow :P)
Best PG song ever.
hahah, begun to laugh when i saw all the World of Warcraft comments! .. xD
FOR ZE HORDE......LOL. but during cata and mop soon coming out, all this shit is happening to the horde while the alliance is in lala happy fun time land.......i have no idea about the quests through the alliance dont judge me :P
lol,.......lok'tar ogar!!! >:D
FOR THE HORDE
to many hot pockets :P
Ohh thatse a big one sweety =)lol
Ah =p im  not the only who does the same, when i lisnen to this in pvp i am a god =p
this song is very motivating. I have the words of the song in my mind all the days, and helps me to fight against my fears.
I like it, 5 stars for paul stanley!!
Spin to win is not garen's quote. Garen doesn't say it. Also Spin to win has nothing to do with this.
To much South Park Warcraft reference comment, how about Garen's reference from League of Legends!?!
you mean 44 people did do that
South Park Wow :DD DDD DDDDD
I LISTEN TO THIS WHILE KILLING BOARS IN THE FOREST IN WOW

@Zrinschchuck Spanish is breathing english in the back dude .-)
@Jamesminson people have always communicated with english mostly
if you meet a foreign person and wish to communicate with him/her, first thing you'll ask is do you speak english, not do you speak spanish
i don't want this to turn into a serious discussion, i just asked it because it is normal that the top comments are in english
I loved this song before I even watched that South Park episode
World of warcraft , Try free at warcraft . com
@TheDrPotatoe no shit
english is the international language, and in order to understand each other, people mostly use english
@Zrinschchuck Because there is not only english in the world.
why are the two top comments in non-english
pouce vert si c'est grace a wow que vous etez la
@Darksquad666 and I as wukong
@stryker741 and I carried as Twitch to this song ahahahah ! XD
I spun until i won.

BEST SONG EVARR when doing quests and leveling in WoW.

Im pretty sure Charlie Sheen listened to this song when he took his drugs
ouais, fin dans fanta, il reprend la scene de south park donc bon...
Fanta et bob et le joueur du Grenier
en fait la musique apparait dans fanta,south park(make love, not warcraft)et dans le joeur du grenier (waterworld)
@DarkZeny Non South-Park !
Hum...je me suis tromp√©, je crois que c'est Waterworld
Fanta et aussi le joueur du grenier (Asterix)
Paul Stanley, the best front-man ever, brought me here,  When this video was shot, he had already undergone 3 hip replacements from thousands of full throttle concerts, and only ever missed 1 kiss show.

Charlie Sheens Theme song?
@LutMejiaJ "fucking russians"... let me guess you are an american and all the thumbs up too... how sad
When the music for this song was being written was the writer thinking guitars ftw?

At any rate it's a great song, guitars or no.
@GhostFace38 actually, complicated progressions and changes, combined with beautiful lyrics do move me. but hey, to each their own. I've only seen kiss like a dozen or so times so I can't say I'm a fan or anything, but if I'm in a party/rock mood, they are quite good.
@GhostFace38 well, liking kiss is your first problem. they put on an awesome show, but they are all terrible musicians. go listen to some Rush or something and come back to me.
@GhostFace38 go back to justin bieber little kiddie.

SPIIN TO WIIIIIIN
@Metallica98189 LOL killing boars xD
I use this song when i go leveling lol!!
What can I say?  This song definitely rocks the house!  Especially with South Park's "Make Love, Not Warcraft"!  :)
This is most definetely charlie sheen's theme song.
16 boars disliked (you have to watch the episode to get this)
Keyboardist looks like Jason Hook
Vevo...You guys fucking suck. I like how you're putting music out into the community, but you're ignoring every band that plays good music, but isn't in the limelight. Also, you're taking all of the views from ordinary users...thanks you fucking douchebags.

Nobody has to agree, I'm just stating my opinion. No troll, I swear upon my life.
16ppls are noobs on warcraft
South Park took Paul Stanley and made him awesome in an extremely lame way... Awesome.
After watching this and "Firestarter" by Gene Simmons, its more clear than ever that Paul Stanley is the talent of KISS.
LIVE TO WIN TILL YOU DIE!
Replay Buton -----> 00:00 <------
@TheOneMcGio 
isnt it Sword of a Thousand Truths :P
Definitely one of the world's top (rock) voices. He's been on top fro more than 3 decades.

he looks like snape
16 People didn't get the Sword of a Thousand Jewels in time.
Southpark :D
Charlie Sheen needs to make a cover of this song
I bet 112,910 views are from South Park.

Thumbs up for insane good combination!
GREAT SONG... THE BEST... HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE BEST SINGER AND FRONTMAN IN THE HISTORY OF MUSIC!
I should be on that stage playing bass next to Paul, it is meant to be.
@fogz42 Why would you do this? It just makes the views go higher! He doesn't care about dislikes, nor does anybody else! Everybody focuses on the number of views. If you do this you're just helping the little fucking douchebag, not destroying him. You'll be just as bad as his little fanboys and fangirls.
stop making stupid JB comments! he gets paid for each, and because he is all over the internet, he has over 400 MILION views  PER VIDEO! everybody shut up about Justin Bieber so once he will be out of our minds! thats want we want isnt it?
@Coleybear8844 can any1 be a stupid? (no, sarcasm)
@Whatsyourfuckinggame 
Now imagine Jeremy Clarckson would say that. Thumbs up if you do :)
I'm a metalhead and even I like to hear this song from time to time when playing WoW mainly because of the lyrics!
@Coleybear8844 are you dumb in the ass? all those kiss fans made this song famous, south park just took it for their wow episode, and like 70% of the people that likes this song doesn't even watch southpark
live to reach level 85 in wow!!!
@SergantSwiftblade Damn, you'r so right!
Why the fuck do you comment about south park and fucking WoW? This song is good without them and was made without so what the fuck?
Cool song, really fucking gay band members and WTF is with the roses?
XD

6 people wanna die as losers... sad
@fogz42 No it's not. Stop Mentioning his name here.
I like how he is using the band from Rockstar INXS.
Paul is the man, he has the talent, the looks, the voice, the body, the personality,he is a super dad, loves his wife, gives back to the fans..............what more can you ask for in a guy he can do it all and does, I suppose that is why I have always been a fan and always will be a fan..................love Paul and Kiss!!!!!!!
does any one notice this song is gayyyy!!!!
SOUTH PARK =D
Lol south park wow song xD
@jeanmalan "Mum, bathroom!!!"
The Lead Guitarist acts a lot like certain living Spuce Tree on stage.

Omg at 1:45, that has GOT to be THE happiest drummer EVER! xDDD
I wish Paul would do another solo tour,  I love to see Paul solo or with Kiss but he is just so relaxed and amazing solo, I think he should do his own clothing line also has great taste in clothes, the man is just talented!!
3 who disliked do not live to win
"I'm a paul Stanley fan" "Where did you first here about him?" "Southpark" "GTFO!"
Thumbs up if you actually new this before shows and other things used it. Thumbs up for KISS/Paul Stanley fans!
SOUTH PARK but even more BRING KISS BACK
@jvali10 I didnt meant to be rude or insulting, do not get me wrong. It is true thought that the music scene in USA is highly suffering from the industry.
It is sad that most of people know this song throught south park.

That explain a lot why americans lost their musical culture. Now all they know is commercial crap and Gangsta rap.
WORLD OF WAAAAARCRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFT + SOUTH PARK= OWNAAAAGE
I actually first heard this in a Solid Snake tribute
I wish Paul would do more solo concerts I think his voice is amazing,  I just think he is even more amazing solo, I also think he needs to have his own clothing line. The man just has it all what can I say, talent, looks, voice.
@ibeenthunderstruck WOW
i love paul I WANT YOUR BABIES jk lol
"they've gone up 50 levels in 3 weeks!"
"A hope?"
"A chance."
i don't like the begining but the rest is a pice of heaven!!!

This is my philosophy to life; Aspiring to things, settingg your goals, and just going for them and not letting any obstacles getting in the way of you accomplishing them.
You may not allows succed, but as long as you've failed on ur own terms...

You've Won
love this song +love this song more when she is in the south park episode
@MontageMan130 Co-lead singer of KISS. Gene and Paul split singing duties with Gene doing the vocals for the heavier songs and Paul taking the mic on the more pop orienented tunes. Paul sang most of the songs from the 80's though when KISS went more glam like most other bands from that era.
Wow, I can't believe I didn't make the connection before. He was the lead singer of "Kiss", and for all I know still is. I feel stupid.
@DarkeyesFX  Holy Shit, he looks strange with out make up and Gene with him
Wait is that Paul Stanley from KISS????
@noemikem fuck yeah Paul is a living LEGEND
live to win 111111111111

Amazing KISS + Paul Stanley
